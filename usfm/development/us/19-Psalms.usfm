\ms Book One
\s Psalm 1 – The Way of Happiness
\rem Revision 2
\q
\v 1 Happy are those
\q2 who do not follow the counsel of the wicked,
\q not halting in ways frequented by sinners,
\q2 nor taking a seat in a gathering of scoffers.
\q
\v 2 But the law of the \nd Lord\nd* is their joy,
\q2 they study it day and night.
\q
\v 3 They are like trees
\q2 planted by runlets of water,
\q yielding fruit in due season,
\q2 leaves never fading.
\q2 In all that they do, they prosper.
\b
\q
\v 4 Not so fare the wicked, not so;
\q2 like chaff are they, blown by the wind.
\q
\v 5 So the wicked will not stand firm in the judgment,
\q2 nor sinners appear, when the righteous are gathered.
\q
\v 6 For the way of the righteous is dear to the \nd Lord\nd*,
\q2 but the way of the wicked will end in ruin.

\s Psalm 2 – The Lord’s Chosen King
\rem Revision 2
\q
\v 1 Why this turmoil of nations,
\q2 this futile plotting of peoples,
\q
\v 2 with kings of the earth conspiring,
\q2 and rulers consulting together,
\q2 against the \nd Lord\nd* and against his anointed,
\q
\v 3 to snap their bonds
\q2 and fling their cords away?
\b
\q
\v 4 He whose throne is in heaven laughs,
\q2 the \nd Lord\nd* mocks them.
\q
\v 5 Then he speaks to them in his wrath,
\q2 and in his hot anger confounds them.
\q
\v 6 “This my king is installed by me,
\q2 on Zion my holy mountain.”
\b
\q
\v 7 I will tell of the \nd Lord\nd*’s decree.
\q He said to me: “You are my son,
\q2 this day I became your father.
\q
\v 8 Only ask, and I make you the heir of the nations,
\q2 and lord of the world to its utmost bounds.
\q
\v 9 You will break them with sceptre of iron,
\q2 shatter them like pottery.”
\b
\q
\v 10 So now, you kings, be wise:
\q2 be warned, you rulers of earth.
\q
\v 11 Serve the \nd Lord\nd* in awe,
\q2 kiss his feet with trembling,
\q
\v 12 lest, angry, he hurl you to ruin;
\q2 for soon will his fury blaze.
\q2 Happy all who take refuge in him.

\s Psalm 3 – A Morning Prayer for Protection
\rem Revision 2
\d A psalm of David, when he fled from his son Absalom.
\q
\v 1 How many, \nd Lord\nd*, are my foes!
\q2 Those who rise up against me are many.
\q
\v 2 Many are those who say of me,
\q2 “There is no help for him in his God.” \qs Selah\qs*
\b
\q
\v 3 But you, \nd Lord\nd*, are shield about me,
\q2 my glory, who lifts up my head.
\q
\v 4 When loudly I call to the \nd Lord\nd*,
\q2 from his holy hill he gives answer. \qs Selah\qs*
\b
\q
\v 5 I laid down and slept:
\q2 now I wake, for the \nd Lord\nd* sustains me.
\q
\v 6 I fear not the myriads of people
\q2 who beset me on every side.
\b
\q
\v 7 Arise, \nd Lord\nd*: save me, my God,
\q2 who strikes all my foes on the cheek,
\q2 and shatters the teeth of the wicked.
\q
\v 8 Victory belongs to the \nd Lord\nd*:
\q2 let your blessing descend on your people. \qs Selah\qs*

\s Psalm 4 – An Evening Prayer
\rem Revision 2
\d For the leader, with stringed instruments. A psalm of David.
\q
\v 1 Answer my cry,
\q2 God, my defender.
\q Often from straits you have brought me
\q2 to spacious places.
\q So now show me your favor
\q2 and hear my prayer.
\b
\q
\v 2 How long, you proud people,
\q2 will my honor be stained
\q by the slanders you love,
\q2 and the lies that you follow? \qs Selah\qs*
\q
\v 3 See! The \nd Lord\nd* has shown me
\q2 his wonderful kindness:
\q the \nd Lord\nd* hears,
\q2 when I call to him.
\b
\q
\v 4 Sin not in your anger:
\q2 but speak in your heart
\q2 on your bed, and be still. \qs Selah\qs*
\q
\v 5 Offer true sacrifice,
\q2 trust in the \nd Lord\nd*.
\b
\q
\v 6 Many are longing
\q2 for fortune to smile.
\q Lift upon us
\q2 the light of your face.
\q
\v 7 You have put in my heart, \nd Lord\nd*,
\q2 a deeper joy
\q than was theirs who had corn
\q2 and wine in abundance.
\b
\q
\v 8 So in peace I will
\q2 lie down and sleep;
\q for you, \nd Lord\nd*, keep me
\q2 safe.

\c 5
\s Psalm 5 – A Prayer for Guidance
\rem Revision 2
\d For the leader: A psalm of David, to be accompanied by the flute.
\q
\v 1 Hear my words, \nd Lord\nd*:
\q2 give heed to my whisper.
\q
\v 2 Attend to my loud cry for help,
\q2 my king and my God.
\q
\v 3 When I pray to you, \nd Lord\nd*, in the morning,
\q2 hear my voice.
\q I make ready for you in the morning,
\q2 and look for a sign.
\b
\q
\v 4 For you are no God who takes pleasure in wickedness:
\q2 no one of evil can be your guest.
\q
\v 5 No braggarts can stand in your presence,
\q2 you hate all workers of wrong.
\q
\v 6 You destroy all speakers of lies,
\q2 people of blood and deceit you abhor.
\q
\v 7 But I, through your kindness abundant,
\q2 may enter your house,
\q and towards the shrine of your temple
\q2 may reverently bow.
\b
\q
\v 8 Lead me, \nd Lord\nd*, in your righteousness
\q2 because of my enemies.
\q2 Make your way level before me.
\q
\v 9 For their mouth is a stranger to truth,
\q2 their heart is a pit of destruction.
\q Their throat is a wide open grave,
\q2 their tongue the smooth tongue of the hypocrite.
\b
\q
\v 10 Condemn them, God;
\q2 let their schemes bring them down to the ground.
\q For their numberless crimes thrust them down
\q2 for playing the rebel against you.
\q
\v 11 But let all who take refuge in you
\q2 ring out their gladness forever.
\q Protect those who love your name,
\q2 so they may exult in you.
\q
\v 12 For you give your blessing, \nd Lord\nd*, to the godly,
\q2 and the shield of your favor protects them.

\s Psalm 6 – A Cry for Help in Time of Trouble
\rem Revision 2
\d For the leader; with instrumental music on the sheminith. A psalm of David.
\q
\v 1 Rebuke me not, \nd Lord\nd*, in your anger,
\q2 punish me not in your wrath.
\q
\v 2 \nd Lord\nd*, be gracious to me
\q2 in my weakness.
\q Heal me \nd Lord\nd*,
\q2 for racked is my body;
\q
\v 3 all of me utterly racked.
\q2 Why do you wait so long, \nd Lord\nd*?
\b
\q
\v 4 Turn, \nd Lord\nd*, rescue me;
\q2 save me, because of your love.
\q
\v 5 For in death none can call you to mind;
\q2 in Sheol who can praise you?
\b
\q
\v 6 I am so weary of sighing.
\q2 All the night I make my bed swim,
\q2 and wet my couch with my tears.
\q
\v 7 My eyes swollen with grief;
\q2 from weeping caused by my foes.
\b
\q
\v 8 Begone, workers of wrong,
\q2 for the \nd Lord\nd* has heard my loud weeping,
\q
\v 9 the \nd Lord\nd* has heard my entreaty,
\q2 the \nd Lord\nd* accepts my prayer.
\q
\v 10 My foes will be stricken with terror,
\q2 brought to shame and dismay in a moment.

\c 7
\s Psalm 7 – A Prayer to the God of Justice
\rem Revision 2
\d A Shiggaion of David, which he sang to the \nd Lord\nd* about Cush, the Benjamite.
\q
\v 1 \nd Lord\nd* my God, I take refuge in you.
\q Deliver me, save me from all who pursue me;
\q2
\v 2 or like lions they will tear me to pieces,
\q2 and rend me, past hope of rescue.
\b
\q
\v 3 \nd Lord\nd*, my God, if my life has been such
\q2 if my hands have been stained with guilt,
\q2
\v 4 if friends I paid back with evil,
\q2 if I plundered my foes without cause,
\q
\v 5 may the enemy chase and find me,
\q2  trample my life to the ground,
\q2 my honor leave in the dirt! \qs Selah\qs*
\b
\q
\v 6 Arise, \nd Lord\nd*, in anger,
\q2 against my foes rise in fury.
\q Awake for my help:
\q2 let justice be done.
\q
\v 7 Gather the nations about you,
\q2 and sit on your lofty throne,
\q2
\v 8 as the \nd Lord\nd*, the judge of the peoples.
\q Judge me, \nd Lord\nd*, in my innocence
\q2 and according to my integrity.
\b
\q
\v 9 Put an end to the wrong of the wicked,
\q2 protect the righteous.
\q Searcher of hearts and minds,
\q2 righteous God.
\q
\v 10 God is my shield:
\q2 he saves the upright in heart.
\b
\q
\v 11 God is a just judge,
\q2 constant in righteous anger.
\q
\v 12 He will sharpen his sword without fail,
\q2 his bow is bent and ready,
\q
\v 13 his deadly weapons are ready,
\q2 his arrows he makes of flame.
\b
\q
\v 14 The enemy who conceives evil;
\q2 pregnant with mischief,
\q2 giving birth to lies,
\q
\v 15 a pit they have made and dug;
\q2 but into the hole that they made they will fall.
\q
\v 16 On their own heads their mischief comes back;
\q2 on their own skulls their violence comes down.
\q
\v 17 I will give thanks to the \nd Lord\nd* for his justice,
\q2 and sing to the name of the \nd Lord\nd* Most High.

\c 8
\s Psalm 8 – God’s Glory in Nature
\rem Revision 2
\d For the leader: A psalm of David, to be accompanied by a stringed instrument.
\q
\v 1 \nd Lord\nd* our God!
\q2 How glorious in all the earth is your name!
\q Your praise reaches as high as the heavens,
\q2
\v 2 from the mouths of children and infants.
\b
\q You have built a fortress
\q2 against your enemies,
\q to silence the foe and the rebel.
\b
\q
\v 3 When I look at your heavens,
\q2 the work of your fingers,
\q the moon and the stars,
\q2 which you have set there,
\q
\v 4 what are mortals,
\q2 that you think of them,
\q humans,
\q2 that you visit them?
\b
\q
\v 5 Yet you made them little less than divine,
\q2 crowned them with glory and majesty,
\q
\v 6 made them lord of the works of your hands,
\q2 put all things under their feet –
\q
\v 7 sheep and oxen,
\q2 all of them;
\q and the wild beasts also:
\q2
\v 8 birds of the air,
\q2 and fish of the sea,
\q2 and all that crosses the paths of the ocean.
\b
\q
\v 9 \nd Lord\nd* our God!
\q2 How glorious in all the earth is your name!

\s Psalm 9 – A Song of Praise the Lord’s Justice
\rem Revision 2
\d For the leader; ’almuth labben. A psalm of David.
\q
\v 1 With all my heart I will praise the \nd Lord\nd*,
\q2 all your wonders I will rehearse.
\q
\v 2 I will rejoice and exult in you,
\q2 singing praise to your name, Most High;
\q
\v 3 because backward my foes were turned,
\q2 they stumbled and perished before you.
\b
\q
\v 4 My right and my claim you have upheld,
\q2 you did sit on the throne as a fair judge,
\q
\v 5 rebuking the nations, destroying the wicked,
\q2 and blotting their name out forever and ever.
\q
\v 6 The foe is vanished, ruined forever,
\q2 their cities destroyed, their memory perished.
\b
\q
\v 7 See! The \nd Lord\nd* is seated forever
\q2 on the throne he established for judgment,
\q
\v 8 ruling the world with justice,
\q2 and judging the nations with equity.
\b
\q
\v 9 So the \nd Lord\nd* proves a haven to the oppressed,
\q2 a haven in times of trouble.
\q
\v 10 Well may they trust you who know your name,
\q2 for those who seek you, you never abandon.
\b
\q
\v 11 Sing praise to the \nd Lord\nd*, whose home is in Zion,
\q2 declare his deeds among the nations.
\q
\v 12 As avenger of blood, he keeps them in mind,
\q2 he does not forget the cry of the wretched.
\b
\q
\v 13 Show me favor, \nd Lord\nd*,
\q2 see how my foes afflict me,
\q2 lift me up from the gates of death;
\q
\v 14 so I may, in your help exulting,
\q2 tell forth your praise at the gates of Zion.
\b
\q
\v 15 The nations are sunk in the pit which they made,
\q2 in the net that they hid, their own foot is entangled.
\q
\v 16 The \nd Lord\nd* is revealed in the judgment he wrought,
\q2 the wicked are snared in their own handiwork. \qs Selah\qs*
\b
\q
\v 17 Let the wicked depart to Sheol,
\q2 all the nations that live forgetful of God.
\q
\v 18 For the needy will not be always forgotten,
\q2 nor the hope of the helpless be lost forever.
\b
\q
\v 19 Arise, \nd Lord\nd*; don’t let them triumph:
\q2 before your face let the nations be judged.
\q
\v 20 Strike them with fear, \nd Lord\nd*:
\q2 show the nations how frail they are. \qs Selah\qs*

\c 10
\s Psalm 10 – A Prayer for Help
\rem Revision 2
\q
\v 1 Why do you stand, \nd Lord\nd*, so far away,
\q2 hiding yourself in times of trouble?
\q
\v 2 The wicked, in their pride, are pursuing the helpless:
\q2 let them be caught in the schemes they have plotted.
\b
\q
\v 3 For the wicked boasts of their wanton greed;
\q2 the robber despises the \nd Lord\nd*, and curses him,
\q
\v 4 in wicked pride, thinks:
\q2 God doesn’t care,
\q2 God doesn’t call to account.
\b
\q
\v 5 Never a season that they do not prosper;
\q2 your judgments are far above out of their sight:
\q2 they scoff at their foes.
\b
\q
\v 6 Each says in their heart,
\q2 “I will never be shaken;
\q I will live for all time
\q2 untouched by misfortune.”
\q
\v 7 Their mouths are full of deceit and oppression:
\q2 under their tongues lurks mischief and wrong.
\b
\q
\v 8 Lying in secret in some village ambush,
\q2 and stealthily watching, they murder the innocent.
\q
\v 9 Like a lion that lurks in a secret lair
\q2 they lurk intending to catch the defenceless;
\q2 to seize them, to drag them away in their net.
\b
\q
\v 10 Their victims are crushed,
\q2 sink down to the ground.
\q Under their claws
\q2 the hapless fall.
\q
\v 11 The wicked say in their hearts
\q2 that God has forgotten,
\q has hidden his face,
\q2 will see nothing.
\b
\q
\v 12 Arise, \nd Lord\nd*, lift up your hand,
\q2 do not forget the cry of the wretched.
\q
\v 13 Why do the wicked treat God with contempt,
\q2 and say in their hearts, “God doesn’t care”?
\b
\q
\v 14 You have seen the trouble and sorrow;
\q2 you mark it all, and will take it in hand.
\q The hapless can count on you,
\q2 helper of orphans.
\b
\q
\v 15 Break the arm of the wicked and evil:
\q2 search out their sin, till no more be found.
\q
\v 16 The \nd Lord\nd* is king forever and ever:
\q2 the nations will vanish from his land.
\b
\q
\v 17 \nd Lord\nd*, you have heard the desire of the humble,
\q2 inclining your ear, strengthening their hearts,
\q
\v 18 rights you have won for the crushed and the orphan,
\q2 so no one on earth may strike terror again.

\s Psalm 11 – Trust in the Lord
\rem Revision 2
\d For the leader. Of David.
\q
\v 1 In the \nd Lord\nd* I take refuge.
\q2 How can you tell me
\q to flee like a bird to the mountains?
\b
\q
\v 2 “See! The wicked are bending the bow,
\q2 their arrow is set on the string,
\q2 to shoot from the shadows at the upright in heart.
\q
\v 3 In this tearing down of foundations
\q2 what good can a good person do?”
\b
\q
\v 4 The \nd Lord\nd* in his holy temple,
\q2 the \nd Lord\nd* in heaven, enthroned.
\q His eyes watch the world,
\q2 they see everyone.
\q
\v 5 The \nd Lord\nd* examines the righteous and wicked,
\q2 and the lover of violence he hates.
\q
\v 6 On the wicked he rains coals of fire and brimstone,
\q2 and their drink will be scorching wind.
\q
\v 7 For the \nd Lord\nd* is just, and justice he loves;
\q2 so the upright will see his face.

\c 12
\s Psalm 12 – A Prayer for the Faithful in a False World
\rem Revision 2
\d For the leader; on the sheminith. A psalm of David.
\q
\v 1 Help, \nd Lord\nd*, for the good are all gone,
\q2 faithful people have vanished.
\q
\v 2 One lies to another, speaking empty lies,
\q2 with flattering lips and false hearts they speak.
\b
\q
\v 3 May the \nd Lord\nd* cut off all the flattering lips,
\q2 and the tongue that utters arrogance,
\q
\v 4 they declare, “Our tongue is our strength,
\q2 our allies our lips: who is lord over us?”
\b
\q
\v 5 “The poor are despoiled, and the needy are sighing;
\q2 so now I will act,” the \nd Lord\nd* declares
\q2 “And place them in the safety they long for.”
\b
\q
\v 6 The words of the \nd Lord\nd* are words that are pure,
\q2 silver smelted, seven times refined.
\q
\v 7 You will keep us, \nd Lord\nd*,
\q2 and guard us from this generation forever,
\q
\v 8 in a world where the wicked prowl,
\q2 and worthless people exalted.

\s Psalm 13 – A Prayer for Help in Trouble
\rem Revision 2
\d For the leader. A psalm of David.
\q
\v 1 How long, \nd Lord\nd*, will you forget me forever?
\q2 How long will you hide your face from me?
\q
\v 2 How long must I nurse grief inside me,
\q2 and in my heart a daily sorrow?
\q2 How long are my foes to exult over me?
\b
\q
\v 3 Look at me, answer me, \nd Lord\nd* my God.
\q Fill my eyes with your light,
\q2 lest I sleep in death,
\q2
\v 4 lest my enemies claim to have triumphed,
\q2 lest my foes rejoice at my downfall.
\b
\q
\v 5 But I trust in your kindness:
\q2 my heart will rejoice in your help.
\q2
\v 6 I will sing to the \nd Lord\nd* who was good to me.

\s Psalm 14 – The Folly of Denying God
\rem Revision 2
\d For the leader. Of David.
\q
\v 1 Fools say in their heart,
\q2 “There is no God.”
\q Vile, hateful their life is;
\q2 not one does good.
\b
\q
\v 2 From heaven the \nd Lord\nd* looks out
\q2 on humans, to see
\q if any are wise,
\q2 and care for God.
\b
\q
\v 3 But all have turned bad,
\q2 the taint is on all;
\q not one does good,
\q2 no, not one.
\b
\q
\v 4 Have they learned their lesson,
\q2 those workers of evil?
\q Who ate up my people,
\q2 eating, devouring,
\q2 never calling to the \nd Lord\nd*.
\b
\q
\v 5 Sore afraid will they be;
\q2 for God is among
\q2 those who are righteous,
\q
\v 6 you may mock the plans of the poor,
\q2 but the \nd Lord\nd* is their refuge.
\b
\q
\v 7 If only help from Zion
\q2 would come for Israel!
\q When the \nd Lord\nd* brings his people
\q2 a change of fortune,
\q how glad will be Jacob,
\q2 and Israel how joyful!

\s Psalm 15 – Standing Firm
\rem Revision 2
\d A psalm of David.
\q
\v 1 \nd Lord\nd*, who can be guest in your tent?
\q2 Who may live on your holy mountain?
\b
\q
\v 2 The person whose walk is blameless,
\q2 whose conduct is right,
\q whose words are true and sincere;
\q2
\v 3 on whose tongue there sits no slander,
\q who will not harm a friend,
\q2
\v 4 nor cruelly insult a neighbor,
\q who regards with contempt those rejected by God;
\q2 but honors those who obey the \nd Lord\nd*,
\q who keeps an oath, whatever the cost,
\q2
\v 5 whose money is lent without interest,
\q and never takes a bribe to hurt the innocent.
\b
\q The person who does these things will always stand firm.

\c 16
\s Psalm 16 – The Joy of Fellowship with God
\rem Revision 2
\d A michtam of David.
\q
\v 1 Keep me, O God, for in you I take refuge.
\q2
\v 2 I said to the \nd Lord\nd*, “You are my \nd Lord\nd*,
\q my happiness rests in you alone.
\q
\v 3 Those who are holy in the land,
\q2 they, they alone, are the noble ones;
\q2 all my delight is in them.”
\b
\q
\v 4 Those who choose other gods
\q2 find endless sorrow.
\q In their offerings of blood I will have no part
\q2 nor take their name on my lips.
\q
\v 5 The \nd Lord\nd* is my share and my portion,
\q2 my fate is in your strong hands.
\b
\q
\v 6 The boundary lines of my life
\q2 mark out delightful country,
\q2 my heritage pleases me well.
\q
\v 7 I praise the \nd Lord\nd* for his counsel,
\q2 which so stirs my heart in the night.
\q
\v 8 I keep the \nd Lord\nd* always in mind:
\q2 with him at my hand, I can never be moved.
\b
\q
\v 9 So my heart is glad, there is joy inside me;
\q2 and in safety of body I live.
\q
\v 10 For you will not give me up to Sheol
\q2 nor let any who love you see the pit.
\q
\v 11 You will show me the path that leads to life,
\q2 to that fulness of joy which is in your presence,
\q2 and the pleasures dispensed by your hand evermore.

\s Psalm 17 – A Prayer for Deliverance
\rem Revision 2
\d A prayer of David.
\q
\v 1 Listen, O \nd Lord\nd*, to my innocence;
\q2 attend to my piercing cry.
\q Give heed to my prayer
\q2 out of lips unfeigned.
\q
\v 2 Let my vindication come from you,
\q2 your eyes see the truth.
\b
\q
\v 3 When you test my heart when you visit at night,
\q2 and assay me like silver – you can find no evil.
\q I am determined that my mouth should not lie.
\q2
\v 4 I gave earnest heed to the words of your lips.
\q
\v 5 My steps have held fast to the paths of your precepts
\q2 and in your tracks have my feet never stumbled.
\b
\q
\v 6 So I call you, O God, with assurance of answer;
\q2 bend down your ear to me, hear what I say.
\q
\v 7 Show your marvelous love, you who save from enemies
\q2 those who take refuge at your right hand.
\b
\q
\v 8 Keep me as the apple of the eye,
\q2 hide me in the shelter of your wings.
\q
\v 9 From wicked people who do me violence,
\q2 from deadly foes who crowd around me.
\b
\q
\v 10 They have closed their hearts to pity,
\q2 the words of their mouths are haughty.
\q
\v 11 Now they dog us at every step,
\q2 keenly watching, to hurl us to the ground,
\q
\v 12 like a lion, longing to tear,
\q2 like a young lion, lurking in secret.
\b
\q
\v 13 Arise, \nd Lord\nd*, face them and fell them.
\q2 By your sword set me free from the wicked,
\q
\v 14 by your hand, O \nd Lord\nd*, from those –
\q2 whose portion of life is but of this world.
\q But let your treasured ones have food in plenty
\q may their children be full and their children satisfied.

\s Psalm 18 – A King’s Song of Gratitude
\rem Revision 2
\d For the leader. Of David, the servant of the \nd Lord\nd*, who recited the words of this song to the \nd Lord\nd* after the \nd Lord\nd* had saved him from the power of all his enemies and from the hand of Saul. He said:
\q
\v 1 I love you, O \nd Lord\nd*, my strength.
\q
\v 2 The \nd Lord\nd* is my rock, my fortress, deliverer,
\q2 my God, my rock, where I take refuge,
\q2 my shield, my defender, my tower.
\q
\v 3 Worthy of praise is the \nd Lord\nd* whom I call on,
\q2 he rescues me from all my foes.
\b
\q
\v 4 The waves of death broke about me,
\q2 fearful floods of chaos.
\q
\v 5 Sheol threw cords around me,
\q2 snares of death came to meet me.
\q
\v 6 In distress I cried to the \nd Lord\nd*,
\q2 and shouted for help to my God;
\q in his temple he heard my voice,
\q2 into his ears came my cry.
\b
\q
\v 7 Then the earth shook and quaked,
\q2 mountains trembled to their foundations,
\q2 and quaked because of his wrath.
\q
\v 8 Smoke went up from his nostrils,
\q2 devouring fire from his mouth,
\q2 coals were kindled by it.
\b
\q
\v 9 Then he bent the sky and came down,
\q2 thick darkness was under his feet.
\q
\v 10 He rode on a cherub and flew,
\q2 darting on wings of wind,
\q
\v 11 with his screen of darkness about him,
\q2 in thick dark clouds of water.
\b
\q
\v 12 At the radiance before him there passed
\q2 hailstones and coals of fire.
\q
\v 13 The \nd Lord\nd* thundered from heaven,
\q2 the Most High uttered his voice.
\q
\v 14 He shot his arrows and scattered them,
\q2 flashed lightnings, and routed them.
\q
\v 15 The channels of the sea were revealed,
\q2 the world was laid bare to its base,
\q at your rebuke, O \nd Lord\nd*,
\q2 at the blast of the breath of your nostrils.
\b
\q
\v 16 He stretched from on high, he seized me,
\q2 drew me up from the mighty waters,
\q
\v 17 and saved me from those who hated me –
\q2 fierce foes, too mighty for me.
\q
\v 18 In my day of distress they assailed me,
\q2 but the \nd Lord\nd* proved my support.
\q
\v 19 To a spacious place he brought me,
\q2 and, for love of me, he saved me.
\b
\q
\v 20 The \nd Lord\nd* repays my innocence,
\q2 he rewards my cleanness of hands.
\q
\v 21 For I kept the ways of the \nd Lord\nd*,
\q2 nor have wickedly strayed from my God.
\q
\v 22 His commandments were all before me,
\q2 his statutes I put not away.
\q
\v 23 And I was blameless before him,
\q2 guarding myself from sin.
\q
\v 24 So the \nd Lord\nd* repaid my innocence,
\q2 my cleanness of hands in his sight.
\b
\q
\v 25 With the loyal you are loyal,
\q2 and with the blameless blameless.
\q
\v 26 With the pure you show yourself pure,
\q2 but shrewd with the devious.
\q
\v 27 For the lowly people you save,
\q2 but haughty eyes you abase.
\q
\v 28 You are my lamp, \nd Lord\nd*,
\q2 my God who enlightens my darkness.
\q
\v 29 With you I can storm a rampart,
\q2 with my God I can leap a wall.
\q
\v 30 As for God, his way is perfect;
\q2 the word of the \nd Lord\nd* is pure.
\q2 He is shield to all who take refuge in him.
\b
\q
\v 31 For who is God but the \nd Lord\nd*?
\q2 And who is a rock but our God?
\q
\v 32 The God who arms me with strength,
\q2 who cleared and smoothed my way.
\q
\v 33 He made my feet like hinds’ feet,
\q2 and set me up on the heights.
\q
\v 34 He taught my hands how to fight,
\q2 and my arms how to bend a bronze bow.
\b
\q
\v 35 The shield of your help you gave me,
\q2 your right hand supports me,
\q2 you stoop down to make me great.
\q
\v 36 In your strength I took giant strides,
\q2 and my feet never slipped.
\q
\v 37 So I chased the foe till I caught them,
\q2 and turned not, till I made an end of them.
\q
\v 38 I smashed them, they could not rise,
\q2 they fell beneath my feet.
\b
\q
\v 39 You did arm me with strength for war,
\q2 you did bow my assailants beneath me.
\q
\v 40 You made my foes turn their back to me,
\q2 and those who did hate me I finished.
\q
\v 41 They cried for help, but none saved them;
\q2 to the \nd Lord\nd*, but he answered them not.
\q
\v 42 I beat them like dust of the market-place,
\q2 stamped them like mud of the streets.
\b
\q
\v 43 From the strife of the peoples you saved me,
\q2 you made me head of the nations,
\q2 peoples I knew not did serve me.
\q
\v 44 On the instant they hear, they obey me,
\q2 foreigners come to me cringing.
\q
\v 45 Foreigners lose courage,
\q2 and come out of their strongholds trembling.
\b
\q
\v 46 The \nd Lord\nd* is alive! Blest be my rock!
\q2 Exalted be God, my protector!
\q
\v 47 The God who gave me revenge,
\q2 and brought down nations beneath me,
\q
\v 48 who saved me from angry foes,
\q2 and set me above my assailants,
\q2 safe from the violent.
\b
\q
\v 49 For this I will praise you among the nations,
\q2 making music, O \nd Lord\nd*, to your name:
\q
\v 50 for great triumphs he grants to his king,
\q2 and faithful love he shows his anointed,
\q2 to David and his seed evermore.

\s Psalm 19 – The Glory of God in the Heavens
\rem Revision 2
\d For the leader. A psalm of David.
\q
\v 1 The heavens declare God’s glory,
\q2 the sky tells what his hands have done.
\q
\v 2 Day tells it to day,
\q2 night reveals it to night,
\q
\v 3 without speaking, without words;
\q2 without the sound of voices.
\q
\v 4 But through all the world their voice carries
\q2 their words to the ends of the earth.
\b
\q He has pitched a tent for the sun in the sky,
\q2
\v 5 it comes out like a bridegroom from his bridal chamber,
\q it joyfully runs its course like a hero.
\q2
\v 6 From one end of the heavens it rises,
\q and around it runs to the other,
\q2 and nothing hides from its heat.
\s In Praise of the Law
\q
\v 7 The law of the \nd Lord\nd* is perfect,
\q2 renewing life.
\q The decrees of the \nd Lord\nd* are trusty,
\q2 making the simple wise.
\b
\q
\v 8 The behests of the \nd Lord\nd* are right,
\q2 rejoicing the heart.
\q The command of the \nd Lord\nd* is pure,
\q2 giving light to the eyes.
\b
\q
\v 9 The fear of the \nd Lord\nd* is clean,
\q2 it endures forever.
\q The \nd Lord\nd*’s judgments are true
\q2 and right altogether.
\b
\q
\v 10 More precious are they than gold –
\q2 than fine gold in plenty,
\q and sweeter they are than honey,
\q2 that drops from the comb.
\b
\q
\v 11 By them is your servant warned;
\q2 who keeps them has rich reward.
\q
\v 12 Who can know their flaws?
\q2 Absolve me from those I know not.
\b
\q
\v 13 Keep your servant from wilful sins –
\q2 from falling under their sway:
\q then blameless and clear will I be
\q2 from great offense.
\b
\q
\v 14 May the words of my mouth and the thoughts of my heart
\q2 be pleasing to you, \nd Lord\nd*,
\q2 my rock and redeemer.

\q2 you have not withheld his lips’ request. \qs Selah\qs*
\b
\q
\v 3 You came to meet him with rich blessings,

\v 7 For the king puts always his trust in the \nd Lord\nd*;
\q2 the Most High, in his love, will preserve him unshaken.
\q
\v 8 Your hand will reach all your foes,

\q
\v 9 You will make them like a furnace of fire,
\q2 when you appear, \nd Lord\nd*.
\q The \nd Lord\nd* will swallow them up in his wrath.
\q2 The fire will devour them.
\q
\v 10 You will sweep their offspring from the earth,
\q2 their children from humanity.
\q
\v 11 When they scheme against you
\q2 and hatch evil plots – they will fail.
\q
\v 12 For you aim your bow at their faces,
\q2 make them turn in flight.
\b

\v 13 Be exalted, \nd Lord\nd*, in your strength,
\q to your might we shall sing and make music.

\s Psalm 22 – The Sufferer’s Triumph
\d For the leader; set to ‘Deer of the Dawn’. A psalm of David.
\q
\v 1 My God, my God, why have you left me,
\q2 my rescue so far from the words of my roaring?
\q
\v 2 I cry in the day, you do not answer,
\q I cry in the night but find no rest.
\b
\q
\v 3 You are the Holy One,
\q2 throned on the praises of Israel.
\q
\v 4 In you our ancestors trusted,
\q2 they trusted and you delivered them.
\q
\v 5 They cried to you, and found safety,
\q2 in you did they trust and were not put to shame.
\b
\q
\v 6 But I am a worm, not a person;
\q2 insulted by others, despised by the people.
\q
\v 7 All who see me mock me,
\q2 with mouths wide open and wagging heads:
\q
\v 8 “He relies on the \nd Lord\nd*; let him save him.
\q2 Let him rescue the one he holds dear!”
\b
\q
\v 9 But you drew me from the womb,
\q2 laid me safely on my mother’s breasts.
\q
\v 10 On your care was I cast from my very birth,
\q2 you are my God from my mother’s womb.
\q
\v 11 Be not far from me, for trouble is nigh,
\q and there is none to help.
\b
\q
\v 12 I am circled by many bulls,
\q2 beset by the mighty of Bashan,
\q
\v 13 who face me with gaping jaws,
\q2 like ravening roaring lions.
\q
\v 14 Poured out am I like water,
\q2 and all my bones are loosened.
\q My heart is become like wax,
\q2 melted within me.
\b
\q
\v 15 My palate is dry as a sherd,
\q2 my tongue sticks to my jaws;
\q2 in the dust of death you lay me.
\q
\v 16 For dogs are round about me,
\q2 a band of knaves encircles me,
\q2 gnawing my hands and my feet.
\q
\v 17 I can count my bones, every one.
\q2 As for them, they feast their eyes on me.
\q
\v 18 They divide my garments among them,
\q2 and over my raiment cast lots.
\b
\q
\v 19 But you, O \nd Lord\nd*, be not far,
\q2 O my strength, hasten to help me.
\q
\v 20 Deliver my life from the sword
\q2 my life from the power of the dogs.
\q
\v 21 Save me from the jaws of the lion,
\q2 from the horns of the wild oxen help me.

\q2 All Jacob’s seed, give him glory.
\q2 All Israel’s seed, stand in awe of him.

\q He hid not his face from me,

\q
\v 25 Of you is my praise in the great congregation;

\q
\v 2 Examine me, \nd Lord\nd*, and test me;
\q2 test my heart and my mind.
\q
\v 3 For your love is before my eyes,
\q2 and your faithfulness governs my way.
\b
\q
\v 4 I never sat down with the worthless,

\q
\v 5 I hate the assembly of knaves,
\q2 I would never sit down with the wicked;
\q
\v 6 but, with hands washed in innocence,
\q2 I would march round your altar, O \nd Lord\nd*,
\q
\v 7 singing loud songs of thanks,

\q In his sheltering tent he hides me:

\v 6 And now that my head he has lifted

\q2 will yet see the goodness of God.

\b
\q
\v 3 Take me not off with the wicked,

\q
\v 4 Give them as they have done,
\q2 as their wicked deeds deserve.
\q As their hands have wrought, so give to them:
\q2 requite to them their deserts.
\q
\v 5 They are blind to all that the \nd Lord\nd* does,

\v 6 Blest be the \nd Lord\nd*, who has heard

\q2 ascribe to the \nd Lord\nd* glory and power
\q
\v 2 Ascribe to the \nd Lord\nd* the glory he manifests:
\q2 bow to the \nd Lord\nd* in holy array.
\b
\q
\v 3 The \nd Lord\nd*’s voice peals on the waters.
\q2 The God of glory has thundered.
\q2 He peals o’er the mighty waters.
\q
\v 4 The \nd Lord\nd*’s voice sounds with strength,
\q2 the \nd Lord\nd*’s voice sounds with majesty.
\b
\q
\v 5 The \nd Lord\nd*’s voice breaks the cedars,
\q2 he breaks the cedars of Lebanon,
\q
\v 6 making Lebanon dance like a calf,
\q2 Sirion like a young wild ox.
\b
\q
\v 7 The \nd Lord\nd*’s voice hews out flames of fire.
\q
\v 8 The \nd Lord\nd*’s voice rends the desert,
\q2 he rends the desert of Kadesh.

\q
\v 9 The \nd Lord\nd*’s voice whirls the oaks,
\q2 and strips the forests bare;
\q2 and all in his temple say “Glory.”

\s Psalm 30 – A Song of Thanksgiving for Deliverance
\d A psalm of David. A song for the dedication of the Temple.
\q
\v 1 I will extol you, O \nd Lord\nd*,
\q2 because you have lifted me up,
\q and not suffered my foes to rejoice over me.
\b
\q
\v 2 I cried to you for help,
\q2 O \nd Lord\nd* my God, and you healed me.
\q
\v 3 You have brought me up, \nd Lord\nd*, from Sheol,
\q2 from my way to the pit back to life you have called me.
\b
\q
\v 4 Sing praise to the \nd Lord\nd*, faithful people;
\q2 give thanks to his holy name.
\q
\v 5 For his anger lasts only a moment,
\q2 his favor endures for a lifetime.
\q Weeping may lodge for the night,
\q2 but the morning brings shouts of joy.
\b
\q
\v 6 When all went well, I imagined
\q2 that never should I be shaken.
\q
\v 7 For by your favor, O \nd Lord\nd*,
\q2 you had set me on mountains strong:
\q but you hide your face,
\q2 and I was confounded.
\b
\q
\v 8 Then to you, \nd Lord\nd*, I cried,
\q2 to the \nd Lord\nd* I begged for mercy,
\q
\v 9 “What profit is there in my blood,
\q2 if I go down to the pit?
\q Can you be praised by dust?
\q2 Can it tell of your faithfulness?
\q
\v 10 Hear, \nd Lord\nd*, and show me your favor,
\q2 \nd Lord\nd* be a helper to me.”
\b
\q
\v 11 You have turned my mourning to dancing;
\q2 my sackcloth you have unloosed,
\q2 and clothed me with joy:
\q
\v 12 that unceasingly I should sing your praise,
\q2 and give thanks to you, \nd Lord\nd* my God, forever.

\s Psalm 31 – A Prayer for Deliverance from Troubles
\d For the leader. A psalm of David.
\q
\v 1 In you, O \nd Lord\nd*, I take refuge;
\q2 let me never be put to shame.
\q Rescue me in your faithfulness;
\q2
\v 2 incline to me your ear.
\q Deliver me speedily.
\q2 Be to me a rock of defence,
\q a fortified house, to save me.
\q2
\v 3 For my rock and my fortress are you;
\q lead me and guide me so your name will be honored.
\q2
\v 4 Draw me out of the net they have hid for me,
\q for you yourself are my refuge.
\q2
\v 5 Into your hand I commend my spirit:
\q2 you ransom me, \nd Lord\nd*, faithful God.
\q
\v 6 I hate those devoted to worthless idols;
\q2 I trust in the \nd Lord\nd*.
\q
\v 7 I will rejoice and be glad in your love,
\q2 because you have looked on my misery,
\q2 and cared for me in my distress.
\q
\v 8 You have not given me into the enemy’s hand,
\q2 you have set my feet in a spacious place.
\b
\q
\v 9 Be gracious to me, \nd Lord\nd*, for I am distressed;
\q2 my eye is wasted away with sorrow.
\q
\v 10 For my life is consumed with grief,
\q2 and my years with sighing.
\q My strength is broken with misery,
\q2 my bones waste away.
\q
\v 11 The scorn of all my foes,
\q2 the butt of my neighbors am I,
\q2 a terror to my acquaintance.
\q At the sight of me in the street
\q2 people turn quickly away.
\q
\v 12 I am clean forgotten like the dead,
\q2 am become like a ruined vessel.
\q
\v 13 I hear the whispers of many –
\q2 terror on every side –
\q scheming together against me,
\q2 plotting to take my life.
\b
\q
\v 14 But my trust is in you, \nd Lord\nd*.
\q2 “You are my God,” I say;
\q
\v 15 my times are in your hand, save me
\q2 from the hand of the foes who pursue me.
\q
\v 16 Make your face to shine on your servant,
\q2 save me in your love.
\q
\v 17 Put me not, O \nd Lord\nd*, to shame,
\q2 for I have called upon you.
\q Let the wicked be put to shame
\q2 silent in Sheol.
\q
\v 18 Strike the false lips dumb,
\q2 that speak proudly against the righteous
\q2 with haughtiness and contempt.
\b
\q
\v 19 How great is the goodness
\q2 you have treasured for those who fear you,
\q and wrought for those who take refuge in you,
\q2 in plain sight of all!
\q
\v 20 In your sheltering wings you hide them
\q2 from plottings of people,
\q you keep them safe in a bower
\q2 from the chiding of tongues.
\b
\q
\v 21 Blest be the \nd Lord\nd*
\q2 for the wonderful love he has shown me
\q2 in time of distress.
\q
\v 22 For I had said in panic,
\q2 “I am driven clean out of your sight.”
\q But you heard my plea,
\q2 when I cried to you for help.
\b
\q
\v 23 Love the \nd Lord\nd*, all you faithful;
\q2 the \nd Lord\nd* protects the loyal,
\q but repays the haughty in full.
\q
\v 24 Let your hearts be courageous and strong,

\s Psalm 32 – A Prayer of Confession and Joy
\d Of David. A maskil.
\q
\v 1 Happy those whose transgression is pardoned,
\q2 whose sin is covered.
\q
\v 2 Happy are those, free from falseness of spirit,
\q2 to whom the \nd Lord\nd* reckons no debt of guilt.
\b
\q
\v 3 When I held my peace, my bones wore away
\q2 with my endless groaning;
\q
\v 4 for day and night did your hand
\q2 lie heavy upon me.
\q The sap of my life was dried up
\q2 as with fierce summer-heat. \qs Selah\qs*
\b
\q
\v 5 I began to acknowledge my sin,
\q2 not concealing my guilt;
\q and the moment I vowed to confess
\q2 to the \nd Lord\nd* my transgression,
\q then you yourself did pardon
\q2 the guilt of my sin. \qs Selah\qs*
\b
\q
\v 6 For this cause let all who are faithful
\q2 pray to you in the time of distress;
\q then, when the great waters rush,
\q2 they will not reach to him.
\q
\v 7 For you are my shelter,
\q2 you protect me from trouble,
\q2 and surround me with deliverance. \qs Selah\qs*
\b
\q
\v 8 “With my eye steadfastly upon you,
\q2 I will instruct and teach you
\q2 The way you should go.
\q
\v 9 Do not be like the horse or the mule,
\q2 that have no understanding,
\q but need bridle and halter to curb them,
\q2 else they will not come near to you.”
\b
\q
\v 10 The godless have many sorrows,
\q2 but those who trust in the \nd Lord\nd*
\q2 will be compassed about by his kindness.
\q
\v 11 Be glad in the \nd Lord\nd*, and rejoice, you righteous;
\q2 and ring out your joy, all you upright in heart.

\c 33
\s Psalm 33 – A Hymn of Thanksgiving
\q
\v 1 Shout for joy in the \nd Lord\nd*, you righteous:
\q2 praise for the upright is seemly.
\q
\v 2 Give thanks to the \nd Lord\nd* on the lyre,
\q2 play to him on a ten-stringed harp.
\q
\v 3 Sing to him a new song,
\q2 play skilfully and shout merrily.
\q
\v 4 For the \nd Lord\nd* is straight in his promise;
\q2 and all that he does is in faithfulness.
\q
\v 5 Justice and right he loves;
\q2 the earth is full of his kindness.
\b
\q
\v 6 By his word the heavens were made,
\q2 all their host by the breath of his mouth.
\q
\v 7 He gathers the sea in a bottle,
\q2 the ocean he puts into store-houses.
\q
\v 8 Let the whole world honor the \nd Lord\nd*,
\q2 let all who live on earth be in awe.
\q
\v 9 For at his word it came into being,
\q2 at his command it stood forth.
\b
\q
\v 10 The \nd Lord\nd* frustrates the designs of the nations,
\q2 what the peoples have purposed, he brings to nought,
\q
\v 11 but the \nd Lord\nd*’s own design will stand forever,
\q2 and what his heart has purposed, through all generations.
\q
\v 12 Happy the nation whose God is the \nd Lord\nd*,
\q2 the people he chose for himself as his own.
\b
\q
\v 13 The \nd Lord\nd* looks down from heaven,
\q2 he sees all of humanity;
\q
\v 14 from where he rules he gazes
\q2 on all who inhabit the earth.
\q
\v 15 He fashions the hearts of them all,
\q2 and gives heed to all that they do.
\b
\q
\v 16 It is not by great armies that kings are victorious,
\q2 it is not by great strength that a warrior saves himself;
\q
\v 17 false hope is the war-horse to usher in victory,
\q2 for all its great might it can provide no escape.
\b
\q
\v 18 See! The eye of the \nd Lord\nd* is on those who fear him,
\q2 on those who hope in his kindness;
\q
\v 19 to deliver their life from death,
\q2 and to keep them alive in famine.
\b
\q
\v 20 We wait for the \nd Lord\nd*:

\q2 in my mouth will his praise be forever.
\q

\q
\v 16 The \nd Lord\nd* sets his face against those who do evil,

\q
\v 17 When righteous cry, they are heard by the \nd Lord\nd*,
\q2 and he saves them from all their distresses.
\q
\v 18 The \nd Lord\nd* is near to the broken-hearted,
\q2 he helps those whose spirit is crushed.
\q
\v 19 Many misfortunes befall the righteous,
\q2 but the \nd Lord\nd* delivers them out of them all.
\q
\v 20 He guards all their bones,
\q2 none are broken.
\q
\v 21 Misfortune will slay the ungodly;

\q2 do battle with those who do battle with me.
\q
\v 2 Grasp shield and buckler,
\q2 and rise up as my help.
\q
\v 3 Draw spear and battle-axe,
\q2 confront those who pursue me.
\q2 Assure me that you will help me.
\q
\v 4 Dishonor and shame be on those
\q2 who are seeking my life!
\q Defeat and confusion on those
\q2 who are planning my hurt!
\q
\v 5 As chaff before wind may they be,
\q2 with the \nd Lord\nd*’s angel pursuing them.
\q
\v 6 Slippery and dark be their way,
\q2 with his angel thrusting them on.
\q
\v 7 For they wantonly hid their net for me,
\q2 and dug a pit to destroy me.
\b
\q
\v 8 Upon them may ruin come unawares;
\q may the net which they hid catch themselves,
\q2 and into the pit may they fall.
\q
\v 9 Then I will exult in the \nd Lord\nd*,
\q2 and be joyful because of his help;
\q
\v 10 and all my being will say,
\q2 “Who, O \nd Lord\nd*, is like you,
\q who save the helpless from those too strong for them,
\q2 the poor and the helpless from those who despoil them?”
\b
\q
\v 11 Violent witnesses rise,
\q2 and ask of me things that I know not.
\q
\v 12 Evil for good they requite me,
\q2 leaving me inwardly comfortless.
\b
\q
\v 13 But when \em they\em* were sick, \em I\em* put on sackcloth,
\q2 and chastened myself with fasting.
\q I prayed with head bowed low,
\q2
\v 14 as if for my friend or my brother.
\q I went about bowed and in mourning,
\q2 as one who laments his mother.
\b
\q
\v 15 When I stumbled, they gleefully gathered,
\q2 strangers gathered around me,
\q2 and tore at me without ceasing,
\q
\v 16 impiously mocking and mocking,
\q2 bearing their teeth at me.
\b
\q
\v 17 How long, \nd Lord\nd*, will you look on?
\q2 Rescue me from their roaring,
\q2 my precious life from the lions.
\q
\v 18 I will then give you thanks in the great congregation,
\q2 and praise you before many people.
\q
\v 19 Suffer not those to rejoice over me
\q2 who are falsely my foes,
\q suffer not those who without cause abhor me
\q2 to wink with the eye.
\b
\q
\v 20 For it is not peace that they speak
\q2 of those who are quiet in the land;
\q but treacherous charges they plot.
\q2
\v 21 With wide open mouths they shout,
\q “Hurrah! Hurrah!
\q2 With our own eyes we saw it.”
\b
\q
\v 22 But you have seen, too, O \nd Lord\nd*,
\q2 keep not silence, O \nd Lord\nd*,
\q2 be not far from me.
\q
\v 23 Bestir you, awake, for my right
\q2 my God, my \nd Lord\nd*, for my cause.
\b
\q
\v 24 You are just, \nd Lord\nd*: win for me justice,
\q2 let them not rejoice over me,
\q
\v 25 inwardly saying, “Hurrah!
\q2 The desire of our hearts at last!
\q2 Now we have swallowed him up.”
\q
\v 26 Shame and confusion together
\q2 on those who rejoice at my hurt!
\q Clothed with shame and dishonor
\q2 be those who are haughty to me!

\q
\v 27 Let such as delight in my cause
\q ring out their gladness,
\q2 and say evermore,

\q
\v 2 It flatters them in their eyes
\q2 that their sin will not be found out.
\b
\q
\v 3 First, their speech becomes wicked and false,
\q2 they give up acting wisely and well.
\q
\v 4 Then they plot deliberate wrong,
\q2 take their stand on the wicked way,
\q2 without the least shrinking from evil.
\b
\q
\v 5 Your love, O \nd Lord\nd*, touches the heavens,
\q2 your faithfulness reaches the clouds.
\q
\v 6 Your justice is like the great mountains,
\q2 your judgments are like the broad sea.

\q

\q2 All may seek shelter in the shadow of your wings.

\q
\v 11 Let no arrogant foot tread upon me,

\s Psalm 37 – Trust in the Lord and Do Good
\d Of David.

\q2 and fade like the green of young grass.
\b
\q
\v 3 Trust in the \nd Lord\nd*, and do good;
\q2 remain in the land, and deal faithfully:
\q
\v 4 then the \nd Lord\nd* will be your delight,
\q2 he will grant you your heart’s petitions.
\b
\q
\v 5 Commit your way to the \nd Lord\nd*;
\q2 trust in him, and he will act,
\q
\v 6 making clear as the light your right,
\q2 and your just cause clear as the noon-day.
\b
\q
\v 7 In silence and patience wait on the \nd Lord\nd*.
\q2 Be not kindled to anger at those who prosper.
\q2 At those who execute evil devices.
\b
\q
\v 8 Desist from anger, abandon wrath:
\q2 be not kindled to anger it leads but to evil:
\q
\v 9 for evildoers will be cut off,
\q2 but the land will be theirs, who wait on the \nd Lord\nd*.
\b
\q
\v 10 Yet but a little, and the wicked vanish:
\q2 look at their place: they are there no more.
\q
\v 11 But the humble will have the land,
\q2 and the rapture of peace in abundance.
\b
\q
\v 12 The wicked plots against the righteous,
\q2  snarls like a wild animal;
\q
\v 13 the \nd Lord\nd* laughs,
\q2 for he sees that his day is coming.
\b
\q
\v 14 The wicked have drawn the sword, and bent the bow,
\q2 to fell the poor, to slay those who walk uprightly;
\q
\v 15 but their sword will pierce their own heart,
\q2 and their bows will be broken in pieces.
\b
\q
\v 16 Better is the righteous person’s little
\q2 than the wealth of many wicked.
\q
\v 17 For the arms of the wicked will be broken,
\q2 but the \nd Lord\nd* upholds the righteous.
\b
\q
\v 18 The \nd Lord\nd* watches over the days of the blameless,
\q2 their heritage will continue forever.
\q
\v 19 They will not be shamed in the evil time,
\q2 in the days of famine they will be satisfied.
\b
\q
\v 20 Because the wicked will perish:
\q but the foes of the \nd Lord\nd*, like a brand in the oven,
\q2 will vanish, like smoke they will vanish.
\b
\q
\v 21 The wicked must borrow and cannot pay back,
\q2 but the righteous is lavish and gives.
\q
\v 22 For those blest by the \nd Lord\nd* inherit the land,
\q2 while those whom he curses will be cut off.
\b
\q
\v 23 The \nd Lord\nd* supports the steps

\q
\v 25 Never, from youth to age,
\q2 have I seen the righteous forsaken,
\q2 or their children begging bread.
\q
\v 26 They are ever lavishly lending,
\q2 and their children are fountains of blessing.
\b
\q
\v 27 Turn away from evil and do good
\q2 and you will live in the land forever.
\q
\v 28 For the \nd Lord\nd* loves justice,
\q2 he does not forsake his friends.
\b
\q The unrighteous will be destroyed forever,
\q2 and the seed of the wicked will be cut off.
\q
\v 29 But the land will belong to the righteous,

\b
\q
\v 30 The mouth of the righteous murmurs wisdom,
\q2 and words of justice are on their tongues.
\q
\v 31 The law of their God is in their heart,
\q2 their steps are never unsteady.
\b
\q
\v 32 The wicked watches the righteous,
\q2 and seeks to put them to death.
\q
\v 33 But the \nd Lord\nd* leaves them not in their hand:
\q2 at their trial they will not be held guilty.
\b
\q
\v 34 Wait on the \nd Lord\nd*, and observe his way:

\q2 you will feast your eyes on the doom of the wicked.
\b

\v 35 I have seen the wicked exultant,
\q2 lifting themselves like a cedar of Lebanon.
\q
\v 36 But the moment I passed, they vanished!
\q2 I sought for them, but they could not be found.
\b
\q
\v 37 Preserve your honor and practise uprightness,
\q2 for such a person fares well in the end.
\q
\v 38 But transgressors will perish together.
\q2 Cut off are the wicked forever.
\b

\q2 and in my flesh is no soundness.
\q
\v 8 I am utterly crushed and numb;
\q2 I cry louder than lion roars.
\b
\q
\v 9 \nd Lord\nd*, you know all that I long for,
\q2 my groans are not hidden from you.
\q
\v 10 My heart is throbbing,
\q2 my strength has failed me.
\q The light of my eyes –
\q2 even it is gone from me.
\b
\q
\v 11 My dear ones and friends keep aloof,
\q2 and my neighbors stand afar off.
\q
\v 12 They who aim at my life lay their snares,
\q2 they who seek my hurt speak of ruin,
\q2 nursing treachery all the day long.
\b
\q
\v 13 But I turn a deaf ear and hear not;
\q2 like the dumb I open not my mouth.
\q
\v 14 I am like one without hearing,
\q2 with no arguments in my mouth.
\b
\q
\v 15 For my hope, O \nd Lord\nd*, is in you.
\q2 You will answer, O \nd Lord\nd* my God,
\q
\v 16 when I utter the hope that those
\q2 who made scorn of my tottering feet
\q2 may not rejoice over me.
\b
\q
\v 17 For I am ready to fall,
\q2 my pain forsakes me never.
\q
\v 18 I acknowledge my guilt,
\q2 I am anxious because of my sin:
\b
\q
\v 19 My wanton assailants are strong,
\q2 those who wrongfully hate me are many,
\q
\v 20 who render me evil for good,
\q2 and oppose me, because I make good my goal.
\b
\q
\v 21 Do not forsake me, O \nd Lord\nd*;
\q2 my God, be not far from me.
\q
\v 22 Hasten to help me,
\q2 O \nd Lord\nd* my savior.

\s Psalm 39 – The Pathos of Life
\d For the leader; for Jeduthun. A psalm of David.
\q
\v 1 I vowed to watch my words,
\q2 and sin not with my tongue,
\q but to put on my mouth a muzzle,
\q2 while the wicked were in my presence.
\q
\v 2 I was silent and dumb,
\q2 speechless:
\q2 but my pain was stirred up.
\q
\v 3 My heart grew hot within me;
\q2 as I mused, the fire was kindled,
\q2 till at last the words came to my tongue.
\b
\q
\v 4 “Teach me, O \nd Lord\nd*, my end,
\q2 and the sum of my days what it is.
\q2 Let me know how transient I am.
\q
\v 5 See! My days you have made but a span,
\q2 and my life is as nothing before you.
\q It is but as a breath that everyone stands: \qs Selah\qs*
\q2
\v 6 it is but in mere semblance we walk to and fro,
\q and all our noise is for nothing.
\q2 We heap up, and know not who will gather.”
\b
\q
\v 7 And now, what wait I for, \nd Lord\nd*?
\q2 My hope is in you.
\q
\v 8 From all my transgressions deliver me;
\q2 make me not the scorn of the fool.
\q
\v 9 I am dumb, never opening my mouth,
\q2 for this is your own doing.
\q
\v 10 Remove your stroke from off me:
\q2 by the might of your hand I am spent.
\q
\v 11 When you rebuke someone to punish their sins,
\q2 you consume, like a moth, what they treasures.
\q2 Everyone is only a breath. \qs Selah\qs*
\b
\q
\v 12 Hear my prayer, O \nd Lord\nd*;
\q2 attend to my cry for help.
\q2 Hold not your peace at my tears.
\q For I am but a guest of yours,
\q2 a stranger visiting, like all my ancestors.
\q
\v 13 Look away from me, let me smile again,
\q2 before I die and am gone.

\s Psalm 40 – Thanksgiving and Petition
\d For the leader. A psalm of David.
\q
\v 1 For the \nd Lord\nd* I waited and waited,
\q2 till, inclining to me,
\q2 he heard my cry.
\q
\v 2 From the horrible pit he drew me,
\q2 up out of the miry clay;
\q he set my feet on a rock,
\q2 and my steps he made firm.
\q
\v 3 He put a new song in my mouth,
\q2 of praise to our God.
\q Many see it, and, filled with awe,
\q2 put their trust in the \nd Lord\nd*.
\b
\q
\v 4 Happy the person who has put
\q2 in the \nd Lord\nd* their trust,
\q not looking to false gods
\q2 or turning to idols.
\q
\v 5 With us you have wrought in rich measure,
\q2 O \nd Lord\nd* our God,
\q your marvels and purposes for us –
\q2 none may compare with you –
\q were I to declare or to tell them,
\q2 past counting are they.
\b
\q
\v 6 In offerings bloody or bloodless
\q2 you have no delight,
\q but with open ears you have made me.
\q Burnt-offering and offering for sin
\q2 are not what you ask.
\q
\v 7 Then said I, “Here I am,
\q2 as the roll of the book has enjoined.
\q
\v 8 My delight, O God, is to do your will,
\q2 and your law is within my heart.”
\q
\v 9 Well, O \nd Lord\nd*, you know
\q2 that, with lips unrestrained,
\q your righteousness I told
\q2 in the great congregation,
\q
\v 10 not hiding it in my heart.
\q2 I have told of your steadfast help,
\q from the great congregation I hid not
\q2 your love and your faithfulness.
\q
\v 11 So do not restrain, \nd Lord\nd*,
\q2 your pity from us.
\q Your love and your faithfulness – ever
\q2 may they be our shield.
\b
\q
\v 12 For evils that cannot be numbered
\q2 have compassed me round.
\q My transgressions have followed me up –
\q2 I can bear it no more.
\q They are more than the hairs of my head,
\q2 and my heart has forsaken me.
\q
\v 13 O \nd Lord\nd*, be pleased to deliver me,
\q2 haste to my help, O \nd Lord\nd*.
\q
\v 14 May those who are seeking my life
\q2 be ashamed and confounded together;
\q may those who delight in my hurt
\q2 be defeated and brought to dishonor.
\q
\v 15 May those who hurrah over me
\q2 be dumbfounded because of their shame.
\q
\v 16 But may all who seek after you
\q2 rejoice and be glad in you.
\q May all those eager for your aid,
\q2 say, “Great is the \nd Lord\nd*” evermore.
\q
\v 17 I am weak and needy,
\q2 yet the \nd Lord\nd* cares for me.
\q You are my help and deliverer;
\q2 don’t delay, my God.

\s Psalm 41 – A Prayer for Healing and Vindication
\d For the leader; for Jeduthun. A psalm of David.
\q
\v 1 Happy are those who consider the weak;
\q2 in the day of misfortune the \nd Lord\nd* will deliver them.
\q
\v 2 He will keep them safe, happy, and long in the land,
\q2 and not give them up to the rage of their foes.
\q
\v 3 The \nd Lord\nd* will sustain them on bed of languishing;
\q2 tending their sickness, as long as they lie.
\b
\q
\v 4 For this cause I say, “\nd Lord\nd*, show me your favor;
\q2 heal me, because I have sinned against you.”
\q
\v 5 My enemies speak of me nothing but evil,
\q2 “When will he die, and his name pass away?”
\q
\v 6 When one comes to see me, their words ring hollow;
\q2 their heart keeps gathering mischief the while;
\q2 and when they go out, they give it speech.
\q
\v 7 In secret they whisper together against me,
\q2 all those who hate me plot evil against me.
\q
\v 8 “Some fatal disease has fastened upon him;
\q2 and now that he lies, he will rise up no more.”
\q
\v 9 My most trusted friend, on whom I relied,
\q2 who ate of my bread, has turned against me.
\b
\q
\v 10 But do you, \nd Lord\nd*, graciously raise me up,
\q2 that I may pay them their due reward.
\q
\v 11 By this will I know you delight in me:
\q2 if my foes may not shout over me in triumph.
\q
\v 12 For my innocence you uphold me,
\q2 and set me forever before your face.

\q
\v 1 Like the hart which longs
\q2 for brooks of water,
\q I long
\q2 for you, God.
\b
\q
\v 2 I thirst for God,
\q2 for my living God.
\q When shall I enter in,
\q2 and see the face of God?
\q
\v 3 My tears have been my food
\q2 by day and by night;
\q for they say to me all the day long,
\q2 “Where is your God?”
\b
\q
\v 4 My heart floods with sorrow,
\q2 as I call to mind:
\q how I used to pass on with the throng,
\q2 at their head, to the house of God,
\q with glad shouts and giving of thanks,
\q2 in the throng who kept festival.
\b
\q
\v 5 Why am I downcast?
\q2 Why this moaning within me?
\q Hope in God;
\q2 for yet will I praise him,
\q2 my help, my God.
\b
\q
\v 6 I am sunk in my misery;
\q2 I will therefore call you to mind
\q from the land of Jordan and Hermon,
\q2 the mountain Mizar.
\q
\v 7 Flood is calling to flood
\q2 at the noise of your cataracts;
\q all your waves and your breakers
\q2 have passed over me.
\b
\q
\v 8 In the day I cry to the \nd Lord\nd*
\q2 to summon his kindness;
\q and the song that I sing in the night
\q2 is a prayer to the living God.
\q
\v 9 I say to God my rock,
\q2 “Why have you forgotten me?
\q Why must I walk so sadly,
\q2 so hard pressed by the foe?”
\q
\v 10 It pierces me to the heart
\q2 to hear the enemy’s taunts,
\q as all the day long they say to me,
\q2 “Where is your God?”
\b
\q
\v 11 Why am I downcast?
\q2 Why this moaning within me?
\q Hope in God;
\q2 for yet will I praise him,

\q
\v 3 Send forth your light and your truth,
\q2 let them be my guides:
\q to your holy hill let them bring me,
\q2 to the place where you live.

\s Psalm 44 – A Lament in Defeat
\d For the leader. Of the Korahites. A maskil.
\q
\v 1 O God, we have heard with our ears,
\q2 all our ancestors have told us
\q of the work that you wrought in their day,
\q2 your wonders in days of old,
\q
\v 2 uprooting and crushing the nations,
\q2 then planting and settling them.
\q For it wasn’t their own sword that won them the land,
\q2
\v 3 it was not their own arm that brought them the victory.
\q Yours was the hand and the arm,
\q2 yours was the face that shone on them with favor.
\q
\v 4 It was you, my king and my God,
\q2 that ordained the victories of Jacob.
\b
\q
\v 5 Through you we can thrust back our foes,
\q2 and by your name tread down our assailants:
\q
\v 6 for not in my bow do I trust,
\q2 nor can my sword win me the victory.
\q
\v 7 Our victory comes from you,
\q2 and confusion to those who hate us.
\q
\v 8 In God we boast all the day long,
\q2 and your name will we praise forever. \qs Selah\qs*
\b
\q
\v 9 Yet you have spurned and disgraced us,
\q2 in not going forth with our armies,
\q
\v 10 and in making us flee from the foe,
\q2 so that those who hated us plundered us.
\q
\v 11 You have let us be eaten like sheep,
\q2 you have scattered us over the world,
\q
\v 12 sold your people for a pittance,
\q2 and getting no gain from their price.
\q
\v 13 You have made us the butt of our neighbors,
\q2 the derision and scorn of all round us.
\q
\v 14 O’er the world you have made us a byword,
\q2 the nations at us shake their heads.
\q
\v 15 My disgrace is forever before me,
\q2 my face is covered with shame,
\q
\v 16 at the words of blasphemer and scoffer,
\q2 at the sight of the foe and the vengeful.
\b
\q
\v 17 All this has come upon us,
\q2 yet we have not forgotten you
\q2 nor falsely dealt with your covenant.
\q
\v 18 Our heart has not turned back,
\q2 nor our steps declined from your way,
\q
\v 19 that you thus should have crushed us down,
\q2 and covered us over with gloom,
\q2 in the place where the jackals roam.
\q
\v 20 Had we forgotten the name of our God,
\q2 or stretched out our hands to a god that was strange,
\q
\v 21 would God not have searched this out?
\q2 For he knows the heart and its secrets.
\q
\v 22 But in your cause it is we are killed all the day,
\q2 and counted as sheep for the slaughter.
\b
\q
\v 23 Rouse yourself, why do you sleep Lord?
\q2 Awake, cast us not off forever.
\q
\v 24 Why do you hide your face,
\q2 forgetting our stress and our misery?
\q
\v 25 For we have sunk down to the dust,
\q2 our bodies cling to the ground.
\q
\v 26 Arise, come to our help:
\q2 for your love’s sake, ransom us.

\q
\v 1 My heart is astir with beautiful words:
\q2 I will sing a song, concerning the king,
\q with tongue like the pen of a ready writer.
\b
\q2
\v 2 Your beauty is more than mortal,
\q2 grace is shed over your lips:
\q therefore God has blessed you forever.
\q2
\v 3 Warrior, strap your sword on your thigh.
\q What glory and splendor!
\b
\q2
\v 4 Good fortune attend you, as forth you ride
\q in the cause of good faith, and as champion of justice.
\q2 May your arm instruct you in deeds of dread.
\q
\v 5 Sharp are your arrows; nations fall under you:
\q2 pierced to the heart are the foes of the king.
\b
\q
\v 6 Your throne shall endure for ever and ever
\q2 your royal sceptre a sceptre of equity.
\q
\v 7 Right you love and wrong you hate:
\q2 therefore the \nd Lord\nd* your God anoints you
\q2 With oil of gladness above your fellows.
\b
\q
\v 8 With myrrh, aloes, and cassia your robes are all fragrant,
\q2 you are gladdened by music of ivory harps.
\q
\v 9 King’s daughters stand ready with jewels for you,
\q2 at your right hand the queen in gold of Ophir.
\b
\q
\v 10 Listen, daughter, and see; and incline your ear:
\q2 forget your folk and your father’s house.
\q
\v 11 And when the king desires your beauty,
\q2 bow to him, for he is your lord.
\q
\v 12 So shall the Tyrians come with gifts,
\q2 and the richest of people will do you homage.
\b
\q
\v 13 The king’s daughter is glorious altogether,
\q2 with dress of pearls inwrought with gold.
\q
\v 14 In many-coloured robes she is led to the king,
\q2 with the virgin companions she brought in her train.
\q2
\v 15 The king’s palace they enter with joy and rejoicing.
\b
\q
\v 16 May sons of yours take the place of your fathers,
\q2 whom you will make princes in all the land.
\q
\v 17 Your name will I celebrate world without end,
\q2 so that nations shall praise you for ever and ever.

\q
\v 2 So we have no fear, though earth should change,
\q2 and the hills totter into the heart of the ocean.
\q
\v 3 Let its waters roar and foam,
\q2 let the mountains shake with the swelling thereof.
\q On our side is the \nd Lord\nd* of hosts,
\q2 our sure defence is the God of Jacob. \qs Selah\qs*
\b
\q
\v 4 A river there is, whose streams make glad

\q
\v 8 Come and see what the \nd Lord\nd* has done,

\q
\v 9 He stills wars to the ends of the earth –
\q2 breaking the bow, snapping the spear,
\q2 burning the chariots in the fire.
\q
\v 10 “Refrain; and know surely that I am God,

\q His holy mountain,
\v 2 that rises so fair,
\q2 is the joy of all the world.
\q Like the mount of the gods is Mount Zion,
\q2 the city of the great king.
\b
\q
\v 3 Once God made himself known
\q2 as the defence of her palaces.
\q
\v 4 For see! A concert of kings
\q2 passed over the frontier together.
\q
\v 5 But one glance, and they were astounded;
\q2 they hastened away in dismay.
\q
\v 6 Trembling took hold of them there,
\q2 like the pains of a woman in labor.
\q
\v 7 They were shattered, as east wind shatters
\q2 the giant ships in pieces.
\q
\v 8 What we heard, we now have seen
\q2 in the city of the \nd Lord\nd* of hosts,
\q the city of our God.
\q2 God will uphold her forever. \qs Selah\qs*
\b

\v 13 Set your mind on her ramparts,

\q2
\v 14 That such is God,
\q our God he it is who shall guide us

\s Psalm 49 – The Problem of the Prosperity of the Wicked
\d For the leader. Of the Korahites. A psalm.
\q
\v 1 Hear this, you peoples all;
\q2 give ear, all you who live in the world
\q
\v 2 people of low degree and high,
\q2 the rich and the poor together.
\q
\v 3 My mouth shall utter wisdom,
\q2 the thoughts of a seeing heart.
\q
\v 4 I incline my ear to a proverb,
\q2 on the lyre I will open my riddle.
\b
\q
\v 5 Why should I be afraid in the days of misfortune,
\q2 when circled by wicked and cunning foes,
\q
\v 6 who put their trust in their wealth,
\q2 and boast of their boundless riches?
\b
\q
\v 7 For assuredly no one can ransom themselves,
\q2 or give to God the price of their life,
\q
\v 8 for the ransom of a life is costly,
\q2 no payment is ever enough,
\q
\v 9 to keep them alive for ever and ever,
\q2 so as never to see the pit at all.
\b
\q
\v 10 But see it they will. Even wise people die,
\q2 the fool and the brutish perish alike,
\q2 and abandon their wealth to others.
\q
\v 11 The grave is their everlasting home,
\q2 the place they shall live in for ever and ever,
\q2 though after their own names they called whole lands.
\q
\v 12 Despite their wealth,
\q2 they perish like dumb animals.
\b
\q
\v 13 This is the fate of the confident fool,
\q2 and the end of those who are pleased with their portion. \qs Selah\qs*
\q
\v 14 Like sheep they descend to Sheol
\q2 with Death for their shepherd;
\q down they go straight to the grave,
\q2 and their form wastes away in their home below.
\b
\q
\v 15 But God will assuredly ransom my life
\q2 from the hand of Sheol;
\q2 for he will receive me. \qs Selah\qs*
\q
\v 16 So be not afraid when someone grows rich,
\q2 when the wealth of their house increases.
\q
\v 17 Not a shred of it all can they take when they die,
\q2 wealth cannot follow them down.
\q
\v 18 Though they count themselves happy, when they are alive,
\q2 and win praise from many for faring so well,
\q
\v 19 they must join their ancestors,
\q2 who see the light nevermore.
\q
\v 20 The wealthy are without understanding,
\q2 they perish like dumb animals.

\v 3 Our God comes, he cannot keep silence,
\q devouring fire is before him,

\v 4 He summons the heavens above
\q2 and the earth to judge his people.
\q
\v 5 Gather to him his saints

\v 8 Not for your sacrifices will I reprove you
\q2 your burnt-offerings are ever before me
\q
\v 9 Not a bullock will I take from your house,

\v 10 for all beasts of the forest are mine,

\v 11 I know all the birds of the air,
\q2 all that moves on the fields is mine.

\v 12 Were I hungry, I would not tell you,

\q2 pay the Most High your vows.
\q
\v 15 Summon me in the day of distress,
\q2 I will rescue you, so will you honor me.”
\b
\q
\v 16 But to the wicked God says:
\q2 “What right have you to talk of my statutes,
\q2 or take my covenant into your mouth
\q
\v 17 while you yourself hate correction,
\q2 and cast my words behind you?
\q
\v 18 When you see a thief, you run with them;
\q2 with adulterers you keep company.
\q
\v 19 You let your mouth loose for evil,
\q2 your tongue contrives deceit.
\q
\v 20 You shamefully speak of your kin,
\q2 and slander your own mother’s son.
\q
\v 21 And because I kept silence at this,
\q2 you did take me for one like yourself.
\q2 But I will convict you and show you plainly.
\b
\q
\v 22 “Now you who forget God, mark this,
\q2 lest I rend you, past hope of deliverance.
\q
\v 23 Those who bring a thank-offering honor me;
\q2 but to those: who follows my way,
\q2 I will show the salvation of God.”

\s Psalm 51 – God be Merciful to Me, the Sinner
\d For the leader. A psalm of David, when Nathan the prophet come to him after he had been with Bathsheba.
\q
\v 1 In your kindness, O God, be gracious to me,
\q2 in your own great pity blot out my transgressions.
\q
\v 2 Wash me clean of my guilt,
\q2 make me pure of my sin.
\b
\q
\v 3 For well I know my transgressions,
\q2 my sin is ever before me.
\q
\v 4 Against you, only you, have I sinned,
\q2 and done that which is wrong in your sight:
\q you therefore are just when you speak,
\q2 and clear when you utter judgment.
\q
\v 5 See! In guilt was I brought to the birth,
\q2 and in sin did my mother conceive me.
\q
\v 6 It’s the innermost truth you desire,
\q2 give me therefore true wisdom of heart.
\b
\q
\v 7 Purge me clean with hyssop,
\q2 wash me whiter than snow.
\q
\v 8 Fill me with joy and gladness,
\q2 let the bones you have broken rejoice.
\q
\v 9 Hide your face from my sins,
\q2 and blot out my guilt altogether.
\b
\q
\v 10 Create me a clean heart, O God,
\q2 put a new steadfast spirit within me.
\q
\v 11 Cast me not forth from your presence,
\q2 withdraw not your holy spirit.
\q
\v 12 Give me back the joy of your help,
\q2 with a willing spirit sustain me.
\b
\q
\v 13 I will teach your ways to transgressors,
\q2 and sinners shall turn to you.
\q
\v 14 Save me from blood, O God,
\q2 and my tongue shall ring out your faithfulness.
\q
\v 15 Open my lips, O \nd Lord\nd*,
\q2 and my mouth shall declare your praise.
\b
\q
\v 16 For in sacrifice you have no pleasure,
\q2 in gifts of burnt-offering no delight.
\q
\v 17 The sacrifice pleasing to God
\q2 is a spirit that is broken;
\q a heart that is crushed, O God,
\q2 you will not despise.
\b
\q
\v 18 Do good in your pleasure to Zion,
\q2 build the walls of Jerusalem.
\q
\v 19 Then will you welcome the due forms of sacrifice,
\q2 then on your altars shall bullocks be offered.

\s Psalm 52 – The Doom of Arrogance
\d For the leader. A maskil of David, when Doeg the Edomite came and told Saul that David had gone to Abimelech’s house.
\q
\v 1 Why glory in mischief, you hero?
\q2 God’s kindness is all the day.
\q
\v 2 Engulfing ruin you plot,
\q2 your tongue like a razor sharpened,
\q2 you practiser of deceit.
\q
\v 3 Evil, not good, you love,
\q2 and falsehood, not words of truth. \qs Selah\qs*
\q
\v 4 But you love all words that devour,
\q2 and a tongue that is given to deceit.
\b
\q
\v 5 But God, on his part, shall destroy you forever,
\q2 grasp you and pluck you out of your tent,
\q2 and root you out of the land of the living. \qs Selah\qs*
\q
\v 6 Smitten with awe at the sight,
\q2 the righteous shall laugh at you.
\q
\v 7 “Look” (they will say) “at the hero
\q2 who did not make God his stronghold,
\q but trusted in his great wealth
\q2 and in the strength of his riches.”
\b
\q
\v 8 But I am like a fresh olive-tree
\q2 in the house of God.
\q I trust in the kindness of God
\q2 for ever and evermore.
\q
\v 9 I will render you thanks for ever
\q2 for what you have done.
\q I will tell how good you are
\q2 in the presence of those who love you.

\s Psalm 53 – The Folly of Denying God
\rem Revision 2
\d For the leader. On mahalath. A maskil of David.
\q
\v 1 Fools say in their heart,
\q2 “There is no God.”
\q Vile, hateful their life is;
\q2 not one does good.
\b
\q
\v 2 From heaven God looks out
\q2 on humans, to see
\q if any are wise,
\q2 and care for God.
\b
\q
\v 3 But all have turned bad,
\q2 the taint is on all;
\q not one does good,
\q2 no, not one.
\b
\q
\v 4 Have they learned their lesson,
\q2 those workers of evil?
\q Who ate up my people,
\q2 eating, devouring,
\q2 never calling to the \nd Lord\nd*.
\b
\q
\v 5 Sore afraid will they be,
\q2 where no fear was;
\q when God scatters the bones
\q2 of the godless people.
\q They will be put to shame,
\q2 when God rejects them.
\b
\q
\v 6 If only help from Zion
\q2 would come for Israel!
\q When God brings his people
\q2 a change of fortune,
\q how glad will be Jacob,
\q2 and Israel how joyful!

\c 54
\s Psalm 54 – A Prayer for Deliverance from Oppression
\d For the leader. With stringed instruments. A maskil of David, when the Ziphites came and said to Saul, ‘David is in hiding among us’.
\q
\v 1 Save me, O God, by your name,
\q2 by your power secure for me justice.
\q
\v 2 Listen, O God, to my prayer,
\q2 give ear to the words of my mouth.
\q
\v 3 For proud men have risen against me,
\q2 and terrible men seek my life,
\q2 men who do not set God before them. \qs Selah\qs*
\b
\q
\v 4 But see! God is my helper,
\q2 the \nd Lord\nd* is sustaining my life.
\q
\v 5 Let their evil fall back on my foes:
\q2 cut them off in your faithfulness, \nd Lord\nd*.
\b
\q
\v 6 Then will I bring you glad sacrifice,
\q2 praising your gracious name;
\q
\v 7 for from all distress you have saved me,
\q2 and feasted my eyes on my foes.

\s Psalm 55 – Betrayed by a Friend
\rem Revision 2
\d For the leader. With stringed instruments. A maskil of David.
\q
\v 1 Listen, God, to my prayer.
\q2 Don’t hide yourself from my pleading.
\q
\v 2 Hear me, and answer;
\q2 for bitter is my lament.
\q
\v 3 I am wild with the noise of the foe,
\q2 with the clamor of the ungodly;
\q for they hurl disaster upon me,
\q2 and attack me with fury.
\q
\v 4 My heart shudders within me,
\q2 terrors of deaths press on me,
\q
\v 5 fear and trembling attack me,
\q2 and horror wraps me round.
\q
\v 6 O for the wings of a dove:
\q2 I would fly away and rest.
\q
\v 7 I would wander far away,
\q2 find refuge in the wilderness. \qs Selah\qs*
\q
\v 8 I would find myself a shelter
\q2 from raging wind and tempest.
\b
\q
\v 9 Confuse them, \nd Lord\nd*, upset their plans;
\q2 for I see violence and strife in the city.
\q
\v 10 By day and by night they make their rounds
\q2 on the city walls,
\q while within is crime and trouble,
\q2
\v 11 within is ruin.
\q Her market-place is never free
\q2 of deceit and tyranny.
\s The Treacherous Friend
\q
\v 12 The taunts were not those of a foe
\q2 that I could have borne;
\q the disdain was not that of an enemy
\q2 I could have shunned them:
\q
\v 13 but it was you, my equal,
\q2 my dear and familiar friend.
\q
\v 14 We used to be so close,
\q2 together we walked in God’s house with the crowd.
\q
\v 15 May death suddenly take them,
\q2 may they go down to Sheol alive,
\q2 for evil lives in their homes and their hearts.
\b
\q
\v 16 But I will call on God,
\q2 the \nd Lord\nd* will save me.
\q
\v 17 Evening and morning and noon
\q2 I lament and moan.
\q He will hear my voice;
\q2
\v 18 though I am attacked by many
\q he will rescue me,
\q2 unharmed from the war.
\q
\v 19 God, who sits on his ancient throne
\q2 will hear and will humble them,
\q for they never change,
\q2 they never fear God. \qs Selah\qs*
\b
\q
\v 20 My friend turned against me,
\q2 betrayed his word.
\q
\v 21 His mouth was smoother than butter,
\q2 but war filled his heart.
\q His words were softer than oil,
\q2 but sharper than swords.
\q
\v 22 Cast your burden on the \nd Lord\nd*,
\q2 and he will sustain you.
\q He will never let the righteous
\q2 be shaken.
\q
\v 23 But you, God, will hurl them down
\q2 to the deepest pit.
\q Bloody and treacherous people
\q2 will not live out half their days;
\q2 but I will trust you.

\s Psalm 56 – A Prayer of Trust in God
\d For the leader. On jonath elem rehokim. Of David. A michtam, when the Philistines seized him in Gath.
\q
\v 1 O God, be gracious to me,
\q2 for people trample upon me,
\q2 all the day righting and pressing me.
\q
\v 2 All the day enemies trample me;
\q2 many there be
\q2 who contend with me bitterly.
\q
\v 3 In the day of my terror
\q2 I trust in you.
\q
\v 4 In God I maintain my cause,
\q2 in God I fearlessly trust.
\q2 What can flesh do to me?
\b
\q
\v 5 They torture me all the day,
\q2 they ceaselessly plan to hurt me,
\q
\v 6 banded together in secret,
\q2 watching my every step,
\q2 as those who hope for my death.
\q
\v 7 Pay them out for their sin, O God,
\q2 hurl down the strong in your anger.
\q
\v 8 You yourself count my wanderings.
\q2 Put in your bottle my tears
\q2 are they not in your book?
\q
\v 9 Then shall my foes be turned back
\q2 in the day that I call.
\q Of this I am sure,
\q2 because God is for me.
\q
\v 10 In God I maintain my cause,
\q2 in the \nd Lord\nd* I maintain my cause.
\q
\v 11 In God I fearlessly trust,
\q2 what can people do to me?
\b
\q
\v 12 Your vows are upon me, O God,
\q2 I will render thank-offerings to you;
\q
\v 13 because you have saved me from death,
\q2 my feet from stumbling,
\q to the end that I walk before God
\q2 in the light of the living.

\c 57
\s Psalm 57 – A Prayer for Protection from Persecution
\d For the leader. Al tashheth. A michtam of David, when he fled from Saul into a cave.
\q
\v 1 Be gracious, O God, be gracious to me,
\q2 for in you I take shelter.
\q In your sheltering wings I take refuge,
\q2 till ruin be over past.
\q
\v 2 I cry to the Most High God,
\q2 to the God who accomplishes for me.
\q
\v 3 He will send me his succour from heaven,
\q2 he will thrust away those who would trample me. \qs Selah\qs*
\q
\v 4 In the midst of lions I lie,
\q2 who devour human prey.
\q Their teeth are spears and arrows,
\q2 and their tongue is a sharpened sword.
\q
\v 5 Be exalted, God, o’er the heavens,
\q2 and your glory o’er all the earth.
\b
\q
\v 6 They set a net for my feet,
\q2 but in it was their own foot caught.
\q Before me they dug a pit,
\q2 but they fell into it themselves. \qs Selah\qs*
\b
\q
\v 7 My heart is steadfast, O God,
\q2 my heart is steadfast.
\q I would sing, I would make music;
\q2
\v 8 awake, my soul.
\q Awake, harp and lyre;
\q2 I would wake the dawn.
\q
\v 9 I would praise you among the peoples, O \nd Lord\nd*,
\q2 and make music among the nations to you;
\q
\v 10 for great to heaven is your love,
\q2 and your faithfulness to the clouds.
\q
\v 11 Be exalted, God, o’er the heavens,
\q2 and your glory o’er all the earth.

\s Psalm 58 – A Prayer for Vengeance on Unjust Judges
\d For the leader. Al tashheth. Of David. A michtam.
\q
\v 1 Do you speak what is right, you gods?
\q2 With equity judge you your people?
\q
\v 2 In the land you practise iniquity – all of you;
\q2 violence do you dispense with your hands.
\q
\v 3 The wicked go astray from the womb
\q2 liars take the wrong path from their birth.
\q
\v 4 Venom have they like the venom of snakes,
\q2 they are like the deaf adder that stops her ears,
\q
\v 5 and refuses to listen to the voice of the charmer,
\q2 or binder of spells, no matter how cunning.
\b
\q
\v 6 O God, break to pieces the teeth in their mouth,
\q2 tear out the great teeth of the young lions, \nd Lord\nd*.
\q
\v 7 May they melt away like running water!
\q2 Like tender grass, cut down may they be!
\q
\v 8 Like the snail that dissolves on its crawling path,
\q2 like the birth untimely which sees not the sunlight.
\q
\v 9 Faster than a thorn-fire heats your pots,
\q2 he will come with his tempest and sweep them away.
\q
\v 10 The sight of such vengeance will gladden the righteous;
\q2 their feet they will wash in the blood of the wicked.
\q
\v 11 People will say, “Yes, the just are rewarded:
\q2 yes, on the earth is a God who is Judge.”

\c 59
\s Psalm 59 – A Prayer for Safety
\d For the leader. Al tashheth. Of David. A michtam, when Saul sent men to watch his house in order to kill him.
\q
\v 1 Save me, O God, from my enemies;
\q2 secure me from my assailants.
\q
\v 2 Save me from those who do wrong,
\q2 save me from the bloodthirsty.
\q
\v 3 For see! They lay ambush for me,
\q2 strong men are banded against me
\q not for sin or transgression of mine,
\q2 for no guilt of mine, O \nd Lord\nd*,
\q
\v 4 they run and make ready. Awake!
\q2 Come forth to meet me, and see!
\q
\v 5 You, O \nd Lord\nd* of hosts,
\q2 God of Israel, awake!
\q And punish the proud, every one;
\q2 spare none of the traitors vile. \qs Selah\qs*
\b
\q3
\v 6 At evening they come,
\q3 and, howling like dogs,
\q3 make their round in the city.
\q
\v 7 Look at their venomous mouths,
\q2 tongues like swords,
\q they think no one
\q2 hears them.
\q
\v 8 But you, \nd Lord\nd*, laugh at them,
\q2 you mock all the insolent.
\q
\v 9 My strength, I will sing to you,
\q2 for God is my sure retreat.
\q
\v 10 My God with his love will meet me,
\q2 and feast my eyes on my foes.
\b
\q
\v 11 Slay them not, lest my people forget,
\q2 let your hosts keep them roaming and wandering.
\q
\v 12 In their sinful speech snare them, O \nd Lord\nd*;
\q2 and may they be trapped in their pride,
\q for the curses and lies that they utter.
\q2
\v 13 In your wrath make a clean end of them,
\q that people, to the ends of the earth,
\q2 may know that God rules in Jacob. \qs Selah\qs*
\b
\q3
\v 14 At evening they come,

\q
\v 15 They roam about for a feast,

\q
\v 16 But I will sing of your might;
\q2 I will ring out your love in the morning.
\q For to me you have been a sure refuge,
\q2 a retreat in the day of my trouble.
\q
\v 17 My strength, I will sing praise to you,

\d For the leader. On shushan eduth. A michtam of David (for teaching), when he fought with Aram-naharaim and Aram-zobah, and Joab returned and defeated twelve thousand Edomites in the Valley of Salt.
\q
\v 1 O God, you have spurned and broken us,
\q2 routing us in your wrath – restore us!
\q
\v 2 You have shaken the land and cleft it;
\q2 heal its tottering breaches.
\q
\v 3 You have made your people drink hardship,
\q2 and given us wine of reeling.
\b
\q
\v 4 You have given those who fear you a banner,
\q2 a rallying-place from the bow, \qs Selah\qs*
\q
\v 5 for the rescue of your beloved.
\q2 Save by your right hand and answer us.
\b
\q
\v 6 God did solemnly swear:
\q2 “As victor will I divide Shechem,
\q2 and mete out the valley of Succoth.
\q
\v 7 Mine is Gilead, mine is Manasseh,
\q2 Ephraim is the defence of my head,
\q2 Judah my sceptre of rule,
\q
\v 8 Moab the pot that I wash in,
\q2 Edom – I cast my shoe over it,
\q2 I shout o’er Philistia in triumph.”
\b
\q
\v 9 O to be brought to the fortified city!
\q2 O to be led into Edom!
\q
\v 10 Have you not spurned us, O God?
\q2 You do not march forth with our armies.
\q
\v 11 Grant us help from the foe,
\q2 for human help is worthless.
\q
\v 12 With God we shall yet do bravely:

\q
\v 5 For you, O God, do hear my vows,

\q
\v 3 How long will you, all of you, batter a man,

\q They take pleasure in falsehood; they bless with their mouth,

\b
\q
\v 5 I wait alone in silence for God;

\q
\v 6 Yes, he is my rock, my help, my retreat,

\v 7 On God rests my honor and safety,
\q2 in God is my strong rock, my refuge.

\q
\v 10 Trust not in gain of extortion,
\q2 set no vain hopes in robbery.
\q As for wealth, if it bears fruit,
\q2 set not your heart upon it.
\b
\q
\v 11 One thing God has uttered,
\q2 two things there are which I heard
\q that power belongs to God,

\s Psalm 63 – Athirst for God
\d A psalm of David, when he was in the wilderness of Judah.
\q
\v 1 O God, my God, you, you do I seek:
\q2 my heart thirsts for you,

\q2 in a parched and waterless land.
\b
\q
\v 2 As I in the temple have seen you,
\q2 beholding your power and your glory,
\q
\v 3 for better than life is your kindness:
\q2 my lips shall utter your praise.
\b
\q
\v 4 So, while I live, I will bless you,
\q2 and lift up my hands in your name.
\q
\v 5 As with marrow and fat am I feasted;
\q2 with joyful lips I will praise you.
\b
\q
\v 6 I call you to mind on my bed,
\q2 and muse on you in the night watches;
\q
\v 7 for you have been my help,
\q2 I joyfully sing in the shadow of your wings.
\q
\v 8 I cling close after you,
\q2 your right hand holds me up.
\b
\q
\v 9 But those who seek after my life
\q2 shall go down to the depths of the earth,
\q
\v 10 given o’er to the power of the sword,
\q2 or as prey for jackals to devour.
\b
\q

\d For the leader. A psalm of David.
\q
\v 1 Hear, O my God, the voice of my lament:
\q2 guard my life from the foe who affrights me.
\q
\v 2 Hide me from villains who secretly plot,
\q2 from the blustering throng of the workers of evil,
\q
\v 3 who have sharpened their tongue like a sword,
\q2 and aimed bitter words like arrows,
\q
\v 4 which from ambush they launch at the blameless,
\q2 shooting swiftly and unafraid.
\b
\q
\v 5 They strengthen their wicked purpose,
\q2 they tell of the snares they have hidden,
\q2 they say to themselves, “Who can see?”
\q
\v 6 They think out their crimes full cunningly
\q2 hidden deep in their crafty hearts.
\b
\q
\v 7 But God with his arrow will shoot them,
\q2 swiftly shall they be smitten.
\q
\v 8 For their tongue he will bring them to ruin,
\q2 all will shudder with horror at the sight of them.
\b
\q
\v 9 Then every person, touched to awe,
\q2 as they ponder what God has wrought,
\q2 will tell the tale of his deeds.
\q
\v 10 In the \nd Lord\nd* shall the righteous rejoice,
\q2 in him shall they take refuge;
\q2 and all the true-hearted shall glory.

\b
\q
\v 9 You visit and water the earth;
\q2 you greatly enrich her
\q with the river of God, which is full of water.
\q2 You prepare the corn thereof,
\q
\v 10 watering her furrows,
\q2 settling her ridges;
\q you make her soft with showers,
\q2 and bless what grows thereon.
\q
\v 11 You crown the year with your goodness,
\q2 your chariot-tracks drip with fatness.
\q
\v 12 The desert pastures are lush,
\q2 the hills greened with joy.
\q
\v 13 The meadows are clothed with flocks,
\q2 the valleys are covered with corn;
\q2 they shout to each other and sing.

\s Psalm 66 – Thanksgiving for National Deliverance
\d For the leader. A song. A psalm.
\q
\v 1 Shout to God, all the earth,
\q2
\v 2 sing praise to his glorious name,
\q2 sing his glorious praise.
\q
\v 3 Say to God, “How dread are your works,
\q2 so great is your might that your enemies cringe to you.
\q
\v 4 All the earth does homage to you,
\q2 singing praises to you,
\q2 singing praise to your name.” \qs Selah\qs*
\b
\q
\v 5 Come and see what God has done,
\q2 awe-inspiring is he in his works among people.
\q
\v 6 He turns the sea into dry land,
\q2 and people cross the river on foot.
\q Let us therefore rejoice in him,
\q2
\v 7 the mighty Ruler eternal,
\q whose eyes keep watch on the nations,
\q2 that no rebel lift up his head. \qs Selah\qs*
\b
\q
\v 8 O bless our God, you peoples;
\q2 sound aloud his praise,
\q
\v 9 who keeps us in life,
\q2 and keeps our feet from slipping.
\q
\v 10 For you, God, have tested us,
\q2 have tried us, as silver is tried.
\q
\v 11 You did bring us into prison,
\q2 and put chains upon us,
\q
\v 12 you did let people ride over our head.
\q2 We went through fire and through water,
\q2 but you led us out to a spacious place.
\b
\q
\v 13 I will enter your house with burnt-offerings,
\q2 I will pay to you my vows,
\q
\v 14 which my open lips have uttered,
\q2 arid my mouth has declared in my straits.
\q
\v 15 I will offer you offerings of fatlings,
\q2 with the odour of burning rams,
\q2 I will sacrifice bullocks with goats. \qs Selah\qs*
\b
\q
\v 16 Come and hear my story
\q2 all who fear God –
\q2 of what he has done for me.
\q
\v 17 For my mouth had no sooner invoked him
\q2 than his praise was under my tongue.
\q
\v 18 Had I cherished sin in my heart,
\q2 the \nd Lord\nd* would never have listened.
\q
\v 19 But assuredly God has listened,
\q2 and attended to my loud prayer.
\b
\q
\v 20 Blessed be God, who turned not aside
\q2 my prayer, nor withdrew his kindness from me.

\s Psalm 68 – Victory
\d For the leader. Of David. A psalm. A song.
\q
\v 1 God arises, his enemies scatter:
\q2 they who hate him flee before him.
\q
\v 2 As smoke before wind is driven,
\q2 as wax melts before fire,
\q2 so before God vanish the wicked.
\q
\v 3 But the righteous rejoice in God’s presence,
\q2 they exult with exceeding joy.
\b
\q
\v 4 Sing to God, make music to his name,
\q2 his name is the \nd Lord\nd*, praise him who rides on the clouds,
\q3 and exult in his presence.
\q
\v 5 Father of orphans, defender of widows,
\q2 is God in his holy abode.
\q
\v 6 God brings home the lonely,
\q2 he leads forth the prisoner to comfort,
\q2 so that none but the rebel lives cheerless.
\b
\q
\v 7 God, when you went in front of your people
\q2 in your march through the desert, \qs Selah\qs*
\q
\v 8 earth shook, the heavens poured rain
\q2 at the presence of God, Sinai’s God
\q at the presence of God, Israel’s God.
\q
\v 9 Rain in abundance, God, you did sprinkle,
\q2 restoring the languishing land of your heritage.
\q
\v 10 A dwelling therein your people found:
\q2 in your goodness, O God, you did care for the poor.
\b
\q
\v 11 The \nd Lord\nd* spoke the glad tidings of victory,
\q2 a great army of women proclaim it:
\q
\v 12 “Kings of armies they flee, they flee,
\q2 and the housewife divides the spoil:
\q
\v 13 dove’s wings covered with silver
\q2 and pinions with shimmer of gold,
\q2
\v 14 set with stones, like snow upon Zalmon.”
\b
\q
\v 15 A mountain of God is the mountain of Bashan,
\q2 a mountain of peaks is the mountain of Bashan.
\q
\v 16 You high-peaked mountains, why look you askance
\q2 at the mountain which God has desired for his home
\q2 whereon the \nd Lord\nd* will live forever?
\q
\v 17 The chariots of God are twice ten thousand:
\q2 the \nd Lord\nd* came from Sinai, his holy place.
\q
\v 18 You did mount the height with trains of your captives,
\q2 and gifts that you had received from the people.
\q2 The rebels shall live with the \nd Lord\nd* God.
\b
\q
\v 19 Blest be the \nd Lord\nd* who sustains us daily,
\q2 the God who is also our savior. \qs Selah\qs*
\q2
\v 20 Our God is a God who is savior.
\q The ways of escape from death
\q2 are known to the \nd Lord\nd* God.
\q
\v 21 Yes, God will shatter the head of his foes
\q2 the rough scalp of those who strut on in their sins.
\q
\v 22 The \nd Lord\nd* said: “I will bring you home from Bashan,
\q2 home from the depths of the sea,
\q
\v 23 that your feet you may bathe in blood,
\q2 and your dogs lick their share of the foe.”
\b
\q
\v 24 In the temple appear God’s triumphal processions,
\q2 processions in praise of my king and my God,
\q
\v 25 with singers in front, and minstrels behind,
\q2 and maidens with timbrels between them, singing,
\q
\v 26 “You of the well-spring of Israel,
\q2 bless the \nd Lord\nd* God in the dance.”
\q
\v 27 There, in front, is Benjamin the little,
\q2 the princes of Judah beside them,
\q2 the princes of Zebulon, princes of Naphtali.

\q
\v 28 God, show your strength,

\q as you did in the past,
\q2
\v 29 from your temple that crowns Jerusalem.
\q Kings shall bring tribute to you.
\q2
\v 30 Rebuke the beast of the reed,

\q2 Trample down the lovers of lies.
\q2 Scatter the nations whose joy is in war.
\q
\v 31 May they come from Egypt with gifts of oil,
\q2 Ethiopia haste with full hands to God.
\b
\q
\v 32 Sing to God, O you kingdoms of earth,
\q2 make melody to the \nd Lord\nd*. \qs Selah\qs*
\q
\v 33 Praise him who rides on the ancient heavens.
\q2 See! He utters his voice, his mighty voice.
\q
\v 34 Ascribe strength to the God over Israel,

\s Psalm 69 – A Prayer for Deliverance and Vengeance
\d For the leader. On shoshannim. Of David.
\q
\v 1 Save me, O God; for the waters
\q2 are threatening my life.
\q
\v 2 I am sunk in depths of mire,
\q2 where ground there is none.
\q I am come into deep deep waters,
\q2 the flood overwhelms me.
\q
\v 3 I am weary of crying, my throat is parched,
\q2 my eyes are wasted with waiting for God.
\b
\q
\v 4 More than the hairs of my head
\q2 are those who wantonly hate me.
\q More than my bones in number
\q2 are those who are falsely my foes.
\q That which I never robbed,
\q2 how am I then to restore?
\q
\v 5 O God, you know my folly,
\q2 my guilt is not hidden from you.
\q
\v 6 Through me let not any be shamed,
\q2 who wait for you, \nd Lord\nd* God of hosts.
\q Through me let not those be confounded
\q2 who seek you, O God of Israel.
\q
\v 7 It’s in your cause that I have borne taunts,
\q2 and my face has been covered with shame;
\q
\v 8 I became to my kindred a foreigner,
\q2 to my mother’s sons a stranger.
\b
\q
\v 9 It was zeal for your house that consumed me,
\q2 and the insults they hurled at you fell upon me.
\q
\v 10 When I chastened myself with fasting,
\q2 they took occasion to taunt me.
\q
\v 11 When I put on a garment of sackcloth,
\q2 they made me the theme of a taunt-song.
\q
\v 12 Those who sit in the gate make sport of me
\q2 in the music of drunken songs.
\b
\q
\v 13 But I pray to you, \nd Lord\nd*,
\q2 for a time of favor.
\q In your great love answer me;
\q2 with your loyal help, save me
\q
\v 14 from sinking down in the mire.
\q2 Lift me out of the deep deep waters,
\q
\v 15 that the rushing flood may not drown me,
\q2 that the deep may not swallow me up,
\q2 nor the pit close her mouth upon me.
\q
\v 16 Answer me, \nd Lord\nd*, in your gracious kindness,
\q2 turn to me in your great compassion.
\q
\v 17 Hide not your face from your servant,
\q2 for I am in trouble; O answer me speedily.
\q
\v 18 Draw near to me, redeem me;
\q2 because of my enemies, ransom me.
\b
\q
\v 19 You know how I am insulted;
\q2 in your sight are all my foes.
\q
\v 20 Insult has broken my heart,
\q2 past cure are my shame and confusion.
\q For pity I looked – there was none!
\q2 And for comforters, but I found none.
\q
\v 21 Poison they gave me for food,
\q2 and to slake my thirst they gave vinegar.
\b
\q
\v 22 May their table, outspread, be a trap to them,
\q2 and their peace-offerings be a snare.
\q
\v 23 May their eyes be darkened and blind,
\q2 make them shake without ceasing.
\q
\v 24 Pour your indignation upon them,
\q2 let your burning wrath overtake them.
\q
\v 25 May their camp be a desolation,
\q2 in their tents be there none to live.
\q
\v 26 For those whom you struck, they persecute,
\q2 and those whom you wounded, they pain yet more.
\q
\v 27 Charge them with sin upon sin,
\q2 may they not be acquitted by you.
\q
\v 28 From the book of life be they blotted,
\q2 may their names not be written with the righteous.
\b
\q
\v 29 Lift me, O God, by your help
\q2 above my pain and misery.
\q
\v 30 Then will I praise God in song
\q2 and magnify him with thanksgiving,
\q
\v 31 which shall please the \nd Lord\nd* better than ox,
\q2 or than bullock with horns and hoofs.
\q
\v 32 The oppressed shall rejoice at the sight.
\q2 You who seek after God, let your heart revive.
\q
\v 33 For the \nd Lord\nd* listens to the poor,
\q2 he does not despise his prisoners.
\b
\q
\v 34 Let the heavens and the earth sing his praises,
\q2 the seas, and all creatures that move in them.
\q
\v 35 For God will bring help to Zion,
\q2 and build up the cities of Judah,
\q2 his people shall live there in possession.
\q
\v 36 His servants’ children shall have it for heritage,
\q2 and those who love him shall live therein.

\q
\v 1 Quickly, God, deliver me,
\q2 hasten to help me, \nd Lord\nd*.
\q
\v 2 May those who are seeking my life,
\q2 be ashamed and confounded.
\q
\v 3 May those who delight in my hurt
\q2 be defeated and brought to dishonor.
\q
\v 4 But may all who seek after you
\q2 rejoice and be glad in you.
\q May all who love your salvation
\q2 say, “Glory to God,” evermore.

\q2 make haste, God, to me.
\q You are my help and deliverer;
\q2 \nd Lord\nd*, don’t delay.

\c 71
\s Psalm 71 – Forsake me not, when I am Old
\q
\v 1 In you, O \nd Lord\nd*, I take refuge,
\q2 let me never be put to shame.
\q
\v 2 In your faithfulness save me and rescue me,
\q2 bend your ear to me and save me.
\q
\v 3 Be to me a rock of defence,
\q2 a fortified house, to save me;
\q2 for my rock and my fortress are you.
\b
\q
\v 4 Save me, my God, from the hand of the wicked,
\q2 from the grasp of the unjust and cruel.
\q
\v 5 For you, \nd Lord\nd*, are my hope,
\q2 in whom from my youth I have trusted.
\q
\v 6 On you have I leaned from my birth;
\q2 from my mother’s womb it was you who did draw me.
\q2 In you is my hope evermore.
\b
\q
\v 7 I have been as a wonder to many,
\q2 for you are my refuge and strength.
\q
\v 8 All the day long my mouth
\q2 is filled with your praise and your glory.
\q
\v 9 Cast me not off in the time of old age;
\q2 when my strength is spent, forsake me not.
\q
\v 10 For my foes whisper against me,
\q2 they who watch me take counsel together;
\q
\v 11 “God has left him,” they say: “pursue
\q2 and seize him, for he is helpless.”
\b
\q
\v 12 O God, be not far from me,
\q2 haste, O my God, to my help.
\q
\v 13 Put my foes to shame and dishonor,
\q2 with insult and shame be they covered.
\q
\v 14 But I will never stop hoping,
\q2 and more and yet more will I praise you.
\q
\v 15 All the day long shall my mouth
\q2 tell your faithfulness and your salvation,
\q2 though I know not how they may be counted.
\b
\q
\v 16 I will tell of the might of the \nd Lord\nd*,
\q2 and your faithfulness praise, you alone.
\q
\v 17 You have taught me, O God, from my youth,
\q2 and till now have I told of your wonders.
\q
\v 18 Even in old age and grey hair,
\q2 O God, do not forsake me.
\q Still would I tell of your might
\q2 unto all generations to come.
\b
\q
\v 19 Your power and your justice, O God,
\q2 extend as far as the heavens:
\q for great are the things you have done.
\q2 Who is like you, O God?
\q
\v 20 You have caused us to see troubles many,
\q2 but you will revive us again.
\q From the depths of the earth
\q2 you will bring me up again.
\q
\v 21 You will multiply my greatness,
\q2 and comfort me again.
\b
\q
\v 22 So with harp I will praise you,
\q2 and your faithfulness, O my God;
\q and make music to you on the lyre,
\q2 O you Holy One of Israel.
\q
\v 23 My lips shall ring out their joy,
\q2 my mouth shall sing praises to you;
\q2 all of me, which you have redeemed.
\q
\v 24 Yes, all the day long shall my tongue
\q2 utter your righteousness;
\q for ashamed and confounded are they
\q2 who were seeking my hurt.

\d Of Solomon.
\q
\v 1 Give the king, O God, your own spirit of justice
\q2 your spirit of right to the son of the king,
\q
\v 2 that with right he may judge your people,
\q2 and your downtrodden ones with justice.
\b
\q
\v 3 May the mountains bear weal for the people,
\q2 and the hills yield fruits of justice.
\q
\v 4 The weak may he help to their rights,
\q2 may he save the sons of the needy
\q2 and crush the oppressor in pieces.
\b
\q
\v 5 May he live as long as the sun,
\q2 while the moon shines – for ages and ages.
\q
\v 6 May he be like the rain on the meadow,
\q2 like showers that water the earth.
\b
\q
\v 7 In his days may justice flourish,
\q2 and welfare abound, till the moon be no more.
\q
\v 8 May he reign from ocean to ocean,
\q2 from the river to the ends of the earth.
\b
\q
\v 9 May his foes bow down before him,
\q2 his enemies lick the dust.
\q
\v 10 May tribute be rendered by kings
\q2 of the isles and of Tarshish;
\q may gifts be brought by the kings
\q2 of Sheba and Seba.
\b
\q
\v 11 May all kings fall prostrate before him,
\q2 and all nations yield him their service.
\q
\v 12 For he saves the poor when he cries,
\q2 the helpless and the downtrodden.
\b
\q
\v 13 He pities the weak and the poor,
\q2 he saves the lives of the poor.
\q
\v 14 He redeems them from wrong and from violence,
\q2 for dear is their blood in his sight.
\b
\q
\v 15 Long may he live;
\q2 and may gold of Sheba be given him;
\q prayer, too, be made for him ceaselessly,
\q2 all the day long may men bless him.
\b
\q
\v 16 May the land have abundance of corn,
\q2 to the tops of the hills may it wave.
\q May the fruit thereof flourish like Lebanon,
\q2 may men spring from the city like grass of the earth.

\ms Book Three
\s Psalm 73 – Fellowship with God Here and Hereafter
\d A psalm of Asaph.
\q
\v 1 Yes, God is good to the upright,
\q2 the \nd Lord\nd* to the pure in heart.
\q
\v 2 But my feet were almost gone,
\q2 my steps had nearly slipped,
\q
\v 3 through envy of godless braggarts,
\q2 when I saw how well they fared.
\b
\q
\v 4 For never a pang have they,
\q2 their body is sound and sleek.
\q
\v 5 They have no trouble like mortals,
\q2 no share in human pain.
\q
\v 6 So they wear their pride like a necklace,
\q2 they put on the garment of wrong,
\q
\v 7 their eyes stand out with fatness,
\q2 their heart swells with riotous fancies.
\q
\v 8 Their speech is mocking and evil,
\q2 condescending and crooked their speech.
\q
\v 9 They have set their mouth in the heavens,
\q2 while their tongue struts about on the earth.
\q
\v 10 Small wonder that people resort to them,
\q2 and drink deep draughts of their lore.
\q
\v 11 “How does God know?” they say,
\q2 “And has the Most High any knowledge?”
\q
\v 12 See! These are the godless,
\q2 with wealth and ease ever increasing.
\b
\q
\v 13 Yes, in vain have I kept my heart pure,
\q2 and washed my hands in innocence;
\q
\v 14 for all the day long was I plagued
\q2 not a morning but I was chastised.
\q
\v 15 But to resolve to speak like they do
\q2 would be treachery to your children.
\b
\q
\v 16 So I sought to understand it,
\q2 but a wearisome task it seemed:
\q
\v 17 till I entered the holy world of God
\q2 and saw clearly their destiny.
\b
\q
\v 18 Yes, you set them on slippery places;
\q2 down to destruction you hurl them.
\q
\v 19 One moment and then what a horror of ruin!
\q2 They are finished and ended in terrors.
\q
\v 20 Like a dream, when one wakes, shall they be,
\q2 whose phantoms the waker despises.
\b
\q
\v 21 So my bitterness of mind
\q2 and the pain that stabbed my heart
\q
\v 22 show how dull I was and stupid
\q2 just like a beast before you.
\b
\q
\v 23 But I am always with you,
\q2 you have hold of my right hand.
\q
\v 24 By a plan of yours you guide me
\q2 and will afterward take me to glory.
\b
\q
\v 25 Whom have I in the heavens but you?
\q2 And on earth there is none I desire beside you.
\q
\v 26 Though flesh and heart waste away,
\q2 yet God is the rock of my heart,
\q2 yet God is my portion forever.
\b
\q
\v 27 For see! Those who are far from you must perish,
\q2 you destroy all who are false to you.
\q
\v 28 But I am happy when close to God;
\q2 the \nd Lord\nd* my God I have made my refuge,
\q2 that I may recount all the things you have done.

\s Psalm 74 – Lament on the Devastation of the Temple
\d A maskil of Asaph.
\q
\v 1 Why, O God, have you spurned us forever?
\q2 Why smokes your wrath against the sheep of your pasture?
\q
\v 2 Remember the community you purchased of old
\q2 to become by redemption the tribe of your heritage,
\q2 Zion, the mountain you made your home.
\q
\v 3 Rouse yourself, visit its ruins complete.
\q2 In the temple the foe has made havoc of all things.
\b
\q
\v 4 Like lions your enemies roared through your house,
\q2 replacing our symbols by signs of their own,
\q
\v 5 hacking, like woodsmen who lift
\q2 axes on thickets of trees,
\q
\v 6 smashing with hatchets and hammers
\q2 all of its carved work together.
\q
\v 7 They have set your temple on fire,
\q2 to the very ground they have outraged
\q2 the place where lives your name.
\q
\v 8 They have said in their heart, “Let us utterly crush them.”
\q2 They have burned all the houses of God in the land.
\b
\q
\v 9 No symbol of ours do we see any more:
\q2 no prophet is there any more,
\q2 none is with us who knows how long.
\q
\v 10 How long, O God, is the foe to insult?
\q2 Shall the enemy spurn your name forever?
\q
\v 11 Why, O \nd Lord\nd*, do you hold back your hand,
\q2 why keep your right hand in the folds of your robe?
\b
\q
\v 12 Yet God is our king from the ancient days,
\q2 in the midst of the earth working deeds of salvation.
\q
\v 13 It was you who did cleave the sea by your might,
\q2 and shatter the heads of the ocean monsters.
\q
\v 14 It was you who did crush many-headed Leviathan,
\q2 and give him as food to the beasts of the wilderness.
\q
\v 15 It was you who did cleave the fountains and torrents;
\q2 it was you who did dry the perennial streams.
\q
\v 16 Yours is the day; yours, too, is the night,
\q2 it was you who did establish the sun and the star.
\q
\v 17 It was you who did fix all the borders of earth:
\q2 summer and winter it’s you who have made them.
\b
\q
\v 18 Yet, for all this, the foe has insulted you, \nd Lord\nd*,
\q2 and a nation of fools has reviled your name.
\q
\v 19 Do not give your dove to the beasts,
\q2 do not forget your afflicted forever.
\q
\v 20 Look to the sleek ones – how full they are:
\q2 the dark places of earth are the dwellings of violence.
\q
\v 21 O let not the downtrodden turn back ashamed:
\q2 let the poor and the needy sing praise to your name.
\b
\q
\v 22 Arise, God, and defend your cause:
\q2 remember how fools all the day insult you.
\q
\v 23 Do not forget the uproar of your enemies,
\q2 the din of your foes that ascends evermore.

\s Psalm 75 – God the Judge
\d For the leader; al tashheth. A psalm of Asaph, a song.
\q
\v 1 We praise you, God, we praise you:
\q2 we would call on your name and declare your wonders.
\b
\q
\v 2 “At the time I choose,
\q2 I will judge fairly.
\q
\v 3 Though earth melt and all her inhabitants,
\q2 it is I who keep steady her pillars.” \qs Selah\qs*
\q
\v 4 I say to the boasters, “Boast not”;
\q2 to the wicked, “Lift not up your horn:
\q
\v 5 lift not your horn on high,
\q2 speak not boldly against the Rock.”
\b
\q
\v 6 For not from east nor west,
\q2 not from desert nor mountains;
\q
\v 7 but God himself is the judge,
\q2 humbling one and exalting another.
\b
\q
\v 8 In the hand of the \nd Lord\nd* is a cup
\q2 foaming wine, richly spiced.
\q Out of this he pours a draught,
\q2 and all the wicked of earth
\q2 must drain it down to the dregs.
\b
\q
\v 9 But I will rejoice forever,
\q2 singing praise to the God of Jacob.
\q
\v 10 I will hew all the horns of the wicked,
\q2 but the horns of the just shall be lifted.

\s Psalm 76 – A Song of Victory
\d For the leader. With instrumental music. A psalm of Asaph, a song.
\q
\v 1 God has made himself known in Judah,
\q2 his name is great in Israel.
\q
\v 2 His tent is in Salem,
\q2 his dwelling in Zion.
\b
\q
\v 3 There he broke the lightning arrows,
\q2 shield, sword, and weapons of war. \qs Selah\qs*
\q
\v 4 Terrible is your splendor
\q2 on the everlasting mountains.
\b
\q
\v 5 Despoiled were the stout of heart;
\q2 in the sleep into which they had fallen,
\q none of the warriors
\q2 could lift a hand.
\b
\q
\v 6 At your rebuke, God of Jacob,
\q2 sank chariot and horse to sleep.
\q
\v 7 Awful are you: who can stand
\q2 before you, when once you are angry?
\b
\q
\v 8 The judgment you gave from heaven
\q2 frightened the earth into silence,
\q
\v 9 when God arose to judgment
\q2 to save the oppressed of the earth. \qs Selah\qs*
\b
\q
\v 10 The fiercest will praise you,
\q2 to you will the remnant hold festival.
\q
\v 11 Vow and pay to \nd Lord\nd* your God,
\q2 and let all who are round him bring presents.
\b
\q
\v 12 He lops off the courage of princes,

\s Psalm 77 – A Prayer for Preservation as in the Days of Old
\d For the leader. On Jeduthun. Of Asaph, a psalm.
\q
\v 1 Loudly will I lift my cry to God,
\q2 loudly to God, so he hears to me.
\q
\v 2 In the day of my trouble I seek the \nd Lord\nd*;
\q2 in the night I lift my hands in prayer,
\q2 refusing all comfort.
\b
\q
\v 3 When I think of God, I moan;
\q2 when I muse, my spirit is faint. \qs Selah\qs*
\q
\v 4 When you hold my eyes awake,
\q2 and I am restless and speechless,
\q
\v 5 I think of the days of old,
\q2 call to mind distant years.
\q
\v 6 I commune with my heart in the night,
\q2 I muse with inquiring spirit.
\q
\v 7 “Will the \nd Lord\nd* cast us off forever,
\q2 will he be gracious no more?
\q
\v 8 Has his love vanished forever?
\q2 Is his faithfulness utterly gone?
\q
\v 9 Has God forgotten to be gracious,
\q2 or in anger withheld his compassion?” \qs Selah\qs*
\b
\q
\v 10 Then I said, “This it is that grieves me,
\q2 that the hand of the Most High has changed.”
\q
\v 11 I will think of the deeds of the \nd Lord\nd*,
\q2 and remember your wonders of old.
\q
\v 12 I will muse on all you have wrought,
\q2 and meditate on your deeds.
\q
\v 13 Then your way, O God, was majestic:
\q2 what God was great as our God?
\q
\v 14 You were a God who did marvels,
\q2 you did show your power to the world
\q
\v 15 by your arm you rescued your people,
\q2 the children of Jacob and Joseph. \qs Selah\qs*
\b
\q
\v 16 The waters saw you, O God.
\q2 The waters saw you and shivered;
\q2 to their depths they trembled.
\q
\v 17 Clouds poured torrents of water,
\q2 thunder rolled in the sky,
\q2 your arrows sped to and fro.
\q
\v 18 Loud was the roll of your thunder,
\q2 lightnings lit up the world.
\q2 Earth quaked and trembled.
\q
\v 19 In your way, \nd Lord\nd*, through the sea,
\q2 in your path through the mighty waters,
\q2 your footsteps were all unseen.
\q
\v 20 You did guide your folk like a flock
\q2 by the hand of Moses and Aaron.

\s Psalm 78 – The Warnings of History
\d A maskil of Asaph.
\q
\v 1 My people, give ear to my teaching:
\q2 bend your ears to the words of my mouth,
\q
\v 2 as I open my mouth in a poem
\q2 on the riddling story of the past.
\b
\q
\v 3 What we have heard and known,
\q2 and what our ancestors have told us,
\q
\v 4 we will not hide from their children.
\q2 We will tell to the next generation
\q the praises and might of the \nd Lord\nd*,
\q2 and the wonders that he has done.
\b
\q
\v 5 He set up a testimony in Jacob,
\q2 a law he appointed in Israel,
\q which he commanded our ancestors
\q2 to make known to their children,
\q
\v 6 that the next generation should know it,
\q2 that the children yet to be born
\q should arise and tell their children;
\q2
\v 7 that in God they might put their confidence,
\q and not forget God’s works;
\q2 but that they might keep his commandments,
\q
\v 8 and not be like their ancestors,
\q2 a generation defiant and stubborn,
\q a generation with heart unsteady,
\q2 and spirit unfaithful towards God.
\b
\q
\v 9 Ephraimites, armed bowmen,
\q2 turned back in the day of battle.
\q
\v 10 They did not keep God’s covenant,
\q2 they refused to walk in his law.
\q
\v 11 They forgot what he had done,
\q2 and the wonders he had shown them.
\b
\q
\v 12 He did wonders before their ancestors
\q2 in the country of Zoan in Egypt.
\q
\v 13 Through the sea which he split he brought them,
\q2 making waters stand up like a heap;
\q
\v 14 he led them by day with a cloud,
\q2 all the night with a light of fire.
\b
\q
\v 15 From the rocks which he split in the wilderness,
\q2 he gave them to drink as of ocean’s abundance.
\q
\v 16 He brought streams out of the rock,
\q2 and made water run down like rivers.
\b
\q
\v 17 Yet they still went on sinning against him,
\q2 they defied the Most High in the desert.
\q
\v 18 They willfully challenged God,
\q2 demanding the food that they longed for.
\q
\v 19 “Is God able,” such was their challenge,
\q2 “to spread in the desert a table?
\q
\v 20 From the rock that he struck there gushed water,
\q2 and torrents that overflowed;
\q but can he also give bread,
\q2 or provide his people with meat?”
\b
\q
\v 21 When the \nd Lord\nd* heard this, he was furious,
\q2 and fire was kindled on Jacob,
\q2 anger flared up against Israel.
\b
\q
\v 22 For they put no trust in God,
\q2 no confidence in his help.
\q
\v 23 So he summoned the clouds above;
\q2 and, opening the doors of heaven,
\q
\v 24 he rained manna upon them for food,
\q2 and grain of heaven he gave them.
\q
\v 25 Everyone ate the bread of angels;
\q2 he sent them food to the full.
\b
\q
\v 26 He launched the east wind in the heavens,
\q2 and guided the south by his power.
\q
\v 27 He rained meat upon them like dust,
\q2 winged bird like the sand of the sea.
\q
\v 28 In the midst of their camp he dropped it,
\q2 all around their tents.
\b
\q
\v 29 They ate and were more than filled;
\q2 he had brought them the thing they desired.
\q
\v 30 But the thing they desired became loathsome:
\q2 while their food was still in their mouths,
\q
\v 31 the wrath of God rose against them.
\q2 He slew the stoutest among them,
\q2 and laid low the young men of Israel.
\b
\q
\v 32 Yet for all this they sinned yet more,
\q2 and refused to believe in his wonders.
\q
\v 33 So he ended their days in a breath,
\q2 and their years in sudden dismay.
\q
\v 34 When he slew them, then they sought after him,
\q2 they turned and sought God with diligence.
\b
\q
\v 35 They remembered that God was their rock,
\q2 and the Most High God their redeemer.
\q
\v 36 But they flattered him with their mouth,
\q2 and lied to him with their tongue.
\q
\v 37 Their heart was not steady with him,
\q2 they were faithless to his covenant.
\b
\q
\v 38 But he is full of pity:
\q2 he pardons sin and destroys not.
\q Often he turns his anger away,
\q2 without stirring his wrath at all.
\q
\v 39 So he remembered that they were but flesh,
\q2 breath that passes and does not return.
\b
\q
\v 40 But how often they rebelled in the desert,
\q2 and caused him grief in the wilderness,
\q
\v 41 tempting God again and again,
\q2 provoking the Holy One of Israel.
\q
\v 42 They did not remember his strength,
\q2 nor the day he redeemed from the foe,
\q
\v 43 how he set his signs in Egypt,
\q2 in the country of Zoan his wonders.
\b
\q
\v 44 He turned their canals into blood,
\q2 their streams undrinkable.
\q
\v 45 He sent forth flies, which devoured them;
\q2 frogs, too, which destroyed them.
\q
\v 46 Their crops he gave to the caterpillar,
\q2 and the fruits of their toil to the locust.
\q
\v 47 He slew their vines with hail,
\q2 and their sycamore trees with frost.
\q
\v 48 He delivered their cattle to the hail,
\q2 and their flocks to bolts of fire.
\b
\q
\v 49 He let loose his hot anger among them,
\q2 fury and wrath and distress,
\q2 a band of destroying angels.
\q
\v 50 He cleared a path for his anger,
\q2 did not spare them from death,
\q2 but gave them over to pestilence.
\b
\q
\v 51 He struck down all the first-born in Egypt,
\q2 the first fruits of their strength in the tents of Ham.
\q
\v 52 He led forth his people like sheep,
\q2 he was guide to his flock in the desert.
\q
\v 53 Securely he led them, and free from fear,
\q2 while their foes were drowned in the sea.
\b
\q
\v 54 To his holy realm he brought them,
\q2 to the mountain his right hand had purchased.
\q
\v 55 He drove out the nations before them,
\q2 and allotted their land for possession,
\q2 and their tents for Israel to live in.
\b
\q
\v 56 Yet they tempted and angered the Most High God,
\q2 they did not observe his decrees.
\q
\v 57 They drew back, false like their ancestors;
\q2 they failed like a treacherous bow.
\q
\v 58 Their shrines stirred him to anger,
\q2 their idols moved him to jealousy.
\b
\q
\v 59 When God heard of this, he was furious,
\q2 and he spurned Israel utterly.
\q
\v 60 He abandoned his home in Shiloh,
\q2 the tent he had pitched among people.
\q
\v 61 He gave his strength up to captivity,
\q2 his glory to the hands of the foe.
\b
\q
\v 62 He gave his people to the sword,
\q2 he was furious with his own.
\q
\v 63 Fire devoured their young men,
\q2 and their maidens had no marriage-song.
\q
\v 64 Their priests fell by the sword,
\q2 and their widows could not weep.
\b
\q
\v 65 Then the \nd Lord\nd* awoke as from sleep,
\q2 like a warrior flushed with wine;
\q
\v 66 and he beat back his foes,
\q2 putting them to perpetual scorn.
\q
\v 67 He disowned the tent of Joseph,
\q2 he rejected the tribe of Ephraim;
\q
\v 68 but he chose the tribe of Judah,
\q2 Mount Zion, which he loves.
\q
\v 69 And he built like the heights his sanctuary,
\q2 like the earth which he founded forever.
\b
\q
\v 70 And he chose David his servant,
\q2 taking him from the sheepfolds.
\q
\v 71 From the mother-ewes he brought him,
\q2 to be shepherd to Jacob his people,
\q2 and to Israel his inheritance.
\q
\v 72 With upright heart did he shepherd them,
\q2 and with skilful hands did he guide them.

\d A psalm of Asaph.
\q
\v 1 Heathen, O God, have come into your land,
\q2 defiling your holy temple,
\q2 and laying Jerusalem in ruins.
\q
\v 2 They have given the bodies of your dead servants
\q2 to the birds of the air to devour,
\q2 and the flesh of your faithful to the beasts of the field.
\q
\v 3 Round about Jerusalem
\q2 they have poured out their blood like water;
\q2 and there was no one to bury them.
\q
\v 4 On every side our neighbors
\q2 revile us and mock us and jeer at us.
\b
\q
\v 5 How long will you be angry, O \nd Lord\nd*?
\q2 Will your jealousy burn like fire forever?
\q
\v 6 Pour out your wrath on the nations that don’t know you,
\q2 on the kingdoms that do not call on your name.
\q
\v 7 For Jacob they devoured,
\q2 they have desolated his home.
\q
\v 8 Do not remember against us our ancestors’ sins;
\q2 O meet us soon with your pity,
\q2 for utterly weak are we.
\b
\q
\v 9 Help us, O God our savior,
\q2 for the renown of your name:
\q for your reputation deliver us
\q2 and cover over our sins.
\q
\v 10 Why should the nations say,
\q2 “Where is their God?”
\q Let revenge for the outpoured blood of your servants
\q2 be shown on the heathen before our eyes.
\q
\v 11 May the groans of the prisoner come before you;
\q2 free the children of death by your mighty arm.
\q
\v 12 Pay our neighbors back sevenfold
\q2 for the scorn they have heaped upon you, O \nd Lord\nd*.
\b
\q
\v 13 Then we, your people, the flock of your pasture,
\q2 will give thanks to you for evermore,
\q2 and tell your praise to all generations.

\v 8 A vine out of Egypt you brought;

\q
\v 9 in the ground you did clear she struck root,
\q2 and she filled all the land.
\q
\v 10 The shade of her covered the mountains,
\q2 her branches the cedars of God.
\q
\v 11 She sent forth her shoots to the sea,
\q2 and her branches as far as the River.
\q
\v 12 Why have you torn down her fences, and left her
\q2 to be plucked at by all who pass by,
\q
\v 13 to be gnawed by the boar from the forest,
\q2 and devoured by the beasts of the field?
\b
\q
\v 14 O God of hosts, return:

\q and visit this vine, and restore her

\d A prayer of David.
\q
\v 1 Incline your ear, \nd Lord\nd*, and answer me,
\q2 for I am afflicted and needy.
\q
\v 2 Guard me, for I am loyal:
\q2 save your servant, who trusts in you.
\q
\v 3 \nd Lord\nd*, be gracious to me, for you are my God;
\q2 I cry to you all the day.
\q
\v 4 Gladden the heart of your servant;
\q2 for to you, \nd Lord\nd*, I set my hope.
\q
\v 5 For you, \nd Lord\nd*, are good and forgiving,
\q2 rich in love towards all who call on you.
\b
\q
\v 6 Listen, O \nd Lord\nd*, to my prayer;
\q2 attend to my plea for mercy.
\q
\v 7 In the day of my trouble I call on you,
\q2 with assurance that you will answer me.
\q
\v 8 None of the gods is like you, \nd Lord\nd*,
\q2 nor are any works like yours.
\q
\v 9 All the nations you have made
\q2 will come and bow down before you,
\q2 giving glory, O \nd Lord\nd*, to your name.
\q
\v 10 For great are you, and a doer of wonders;
\q2 you alone are God.
\b
\q
\v 11 Teach me, O \nd Lord\nd*, your way,
\q2 that I may walk in your truth:
\q2 so my heart shall rejoice in your name.
\q
\v 12 I will give you thanks, O \nd Lord\nd*,
\q2 with all my heart, my God,
\q2 I will honor your name forever.
\q
\v 13 For great is your love towards me,
\q2 from the depths of Sheol you have saved me.
\b
\q
\v 14 Haughty men have risen up against me, O God,
\q2 a band of the violent seeking my life,
\q2 who think nothing of you.
\q
\v 15 But you are a God of pity and grace,
\q2 patient and rich in kindness and faithfulness;
\q2 turn to me with your grace, O \nd Lord\nd*.
\q
\v 16 Grant your strength to your servant,
\q2 and save the child of your handmaid.
\q
\v 17 Show me a sign of your favor,
\q2 which those who hate me may see with confusion,
\q2 since you, \nd Lord\nd*, are my helper and comforter.

\q
\v 1 On the holy mountain stands
\q2 the city he founded.
\q
\v 2 The \nd Lord\nd* loves the gates of Zion
\q2 more than all the dwellings of Jacob.
\q
\v 3 Glorious things he is speaking of you,
\q2 you city of God. \qs Selah\qs*
\b
\q
\v 4 “Among those who are mine I name Rahab and Babylon,
\q2 Philistia, Tyre, Ethiopia,
\q2 their people will say I was born in Zion.
\q
\v 5 As for Zion it will be said
\q2 each and all were born in her.”
\q The \nd Lord\nd* will preserve her.
\b
\q
\v 6 The \nd Lord\nd* will count, when enrolling the peoples,
\q2 “This one was born there, and that one was born there.” \qs Selah\qs*
\q

\s Psalm 88 – The Prayer of Despair
\q
\v 1 O \nd Lord\nd* my God,
\q2 I cry for help in the day-time,
\q2 in the night my cry is before you;
\q
\v 2 let my prayer come into your presence,
\q2 incline your ear to my cry.
\b
\q
\v 3 For I am sated with sorrow,
\q2 my life draws near to Sheol.
\q
\v 4 I am counted with those who go down to the pit;
\q2  without strength am I.
\b
\q
\v 5 My home is among the dead,
\q2 like the slain that lie in the grave,
\q whom you remember no more
\q2 cut off as they are from your hand.
\b
\q
\v 6 In the deepest pit you have put me,
\q2 in shadows deep and dark.
\q
\v 7 Your wrath lies heavy upon me,
\q2 waves of your anger roll over me. \qs Selah\qs*
\b
\q
\v 8 You have put my friends far from me,
\q2 you have made them shun me.
\q I am shut in, and cannot escape,
\q2
\v 9 my eyes are wasted with sorrow.
\q I call on you, \nd Lord\nd*, every day,
\q2 spreading my hands out to you.
\b
\q
\v 10 For the dead can you work wonders?
\q2 Can the shades rise again to praise you? \qs Selah\qs*
\q
\v 11 Can your kindness be told in the grave,
\q2 your faithfulness in the tomb?
\q
\v 12 Can your wonders be known in the darkness,
\q2 or your help in the land of forgetfulness?
\b
\q
\v 13 I cry for help to you,
\q2 in the morning my prayer comes before you.
\q
\v 14 Why, O \nd Lord\nd*, do you spurn me,
\q2 and hide your face from me?
\q
\v 15 From my youth I am wretched and dying,
\q2 I am numbed by the terrors I bear.
\b
\q
\v 16 The fires of your wrath have passed over me,
\q2 your terrors destroy me,
\q
\v 17 surging around me forever,
\q2 hemming me in altogether.
\q
\v 18 Those who love me you put far from me;
\q2 the dark is my only friend.

\s Psalm 89 – The Promise to David
\d A song. A psalm of the Korahites.
\q
\v 1 I will sing evermore of the love of the \nd Lord\nd*,
\q2 proclaiming to all generations his faithfulness.
\q
\v 2 For your love you did promise to build up forever,
\q2 your faithfulness firm as the heavens themselves.
\b
\q
\v 3 “I have made with my chosen a covenant,
\q2 and sworn to David my servant,
\q
\v 4 to establish his seed forever,
\q2 and to build up his throne to all ages.” \qs Selah\qs*
\b
\q
\v 5 Then the holy assembly in heaven
\q2 praised your marvelous faithfulness, \nd Lord\nd*.
\q
\v 6 For who in the skies may compare with the \nd Lord\nd*?
\q2 Who is like the \nd Lord\nd* among the gods?
\b
\q
\v 7 A God to be feared in the holy assembly,
\q2 awful and great above all who are round him.
\q
\v 8 O \nd Lord\nd* God of hosts, who is mighty as you?
\q2 Your strength and faithfulness, \nd Lord\nd*, surround you.
\b
\q
\v 9 You are the \nd Lord\nd* of the raging sea:
\q2 when its waves surge, it is you who still them.
\q
\v 10 It was you who did pierce and crush Rahab in pieces,
\q2 and scatter your foes by your mighty arm.
\b
\q
\v 11 Yours are the heavens, yours also the earth,
\q2 the world and its fulness, it’s you who did found them.
\q
\v 12 The north and the south, it’s you have created them;
\q2 Tabor and Hermon shout praise to your name.
\b
\q
\v 13 You have an arm with the might of a hero;
\q2 strong is your hand, high uplifted your right hand.
\q
\v 14 Justice and right are the base of your throne,
\q2 kindness and faithfulness ever attend you.
\b
\q
\v 15 Happy the people who know the glad shout,
\q2 who walk, O \nd Lord\nd*, in the light of your face.
\q
\v 16 They exult in your name all the day,
\q2 and your righteousness they extol.
\b
\q
\v 17 For you are our strength and our pride.
\q2 Your favor will lift us to honor.
\q
\v 18 For the holy \nd Lord\nd* of Israel
\q2 keeps our defender and king.
\b
\q
\v 19 In a vision of old you did speak
\q2 in this way to the one whom you loved:
\q “A crown I have set on the hero
\q2 I chose to be over the people
\b
\q
\v 20 “I found my servant David,
\q2 and anointed with holy oil.
\q
\v 21 My hand will be with him forever,
\q2 my arm will give him strength.
\b
\q
\v 22 “No enemy will dare to assail him,
\q2 nor the wicked to oppress him;
\q
\v 23 but his foes I will shatter before him,
\q2 I will strike down those who hate him.
\b
\q
\v 24 “My loyal love shall attend him,
\q2 and I will lift him to honor.
\q
\v 25 I will set his hand on the sea,
\q2 and his right hand on the rivers.
\b
\q
\v 26 “As for him, he will call me ‘My father,
\q2 my God, and my rock of salvation.’
\q
\v 27 And I will make him my first-born,
\q2 highest of kings on the earth.
\b
\q
\v 28 “My love will I keep for him ever,
\q2 my covenant with him shall stand fast.
\q
\v 29 His line will I make everlasting,
\q2 and his throne as the days of the heavens.
\b
\q
\v 30 “If his children forsake my law,
\q2 and walk not as I have ordained;
\q
\v 31 if they profane my statutes,
\q2 and do not keep my commandments;
\b
\q
\v 32 “I will punish their sin with the rod,
\q2 their iniquity with scourges.
\q
\v 33 But my love will I not take from him,
\q2 nor will I belie my faithfulness.
\b
\q
\v 34 “I will not profane my covenant
\q2 by changing the word that has passed my lips.
\q
\v 35 Once have I solemnly sworn
\q2 and I would not lie to David,
\b
\q
\v 36 “that his line should endure forever,

\q
\v 37 firm as the moon which for ever
\q2 and ever is fixed in the sky.” \qs Selah\qs*
\b
\q
\v 38 But you have cast off in contempt,
\q2 and been furious with your anointed.
\q
\v 39 You have spurned the covenant with your servant,
\q2 and his sacred crown dashed to the ground.
\b
\q
\v 40 You have broken down all his walls,
\q2 and laid his bulwarks in ruins.
\q
\v 41 All who pass on their way despoil him,
\q2 the scorn of his neighbors is he now.
\b
\q
\v 42 You have given his foes the victory,
\q2 and made all his enemies glad.
\q
\v 43 You have turned back his sword from the foe,
\q2 you did not lift him up in the battle.
\b
\q
\v 44 The sceptre you took from his hand,
\q2 and his throne you did hurl to the ground.
\q
\v 45 You have shortened the days of his youth,
\q2 and covered him with shame. \qs Selah\qs*
\b
\q
\v 46 How long, \nd Lord\nd* will you hide you forever?
\q2 How long are the fires of your wrath to burn?
\q
\v 47 Remember, \nd Lord\nd*, the shortness of life
\q2 how fleeting you made all people.
\b
\q
\v 48 Who can live without seeing death?
\q2 Who can rescue their life from the clutch of Sheol? \qs Selah\qs*
\q
\v 49 Where, \nd Lord\nd*, is your kindness of old,
\q2 which you in your faithfulness swore to David?
\b
\q
\v 50 Remember, O \nd Lord\nd*, how your servants are mocked,

\q
\v 51 The scorn which your enemies hurl, O \nd Lord\nd*,
\q2 which they hurl at the footsteps of your anointed.

\d A prayer of Moses, the man of God.
\q
\v 1 \nd Lord\nd*, you have been a home to us
\q2 one generation after another.
\q
\v 2 Before the mountains were born,
\q2 or the earth and the world were brought forth,
\q from everlasting to everlasting
\q2 you are God.
\b
\q
\v 3 You bring us back to the dust,
\q2 you summon mortals to return.
\q
\v 4 For you see a thousand years
\q2 as the passing of yesterday,
\q2 as a watch in the night.
\b
\q
\v 5 Your floods sweep them away;
\q they are like a dream,
\q2 or like grass which sprouts in the morning,
\q
\v 6 which blossoms and sprouts in the morning,
\q2 but by evening is cut and withered.
\b
\q
\v 7 For your anger consumes us,
\q2 the heat of your wrath confounds us.
\q
\v 8 Our sins you have set before you,
\q2 our secrets in the light of your face.
\q
\v 9 For through your wrath our days are declining,
\q2 we bring our years to an end as a sigh.
\b
\q
\v 10 The span of our life is seventy years,
\q2 or, if we are strong, maybe eighty;
\q yet is their breadth but empty toil,
\q2 for swiftly they go, and we fly away.
\b
\q
\v 11 Who lays to heart the power of your anger?
\q2 Or who stands in reverent awe of your wrath?
\q
\v 12 O teach us to count our days
\q2 so our minds may learn wisdom.
\b
\q
\v 13 Return, O \nd Lord\nd*; why so long?
\q2 Relent on your servants.
\q
\v 14 Grant us your love to the full in the morning,
\q2 that all our days we may shout for joy.
\b
\q
\v 15 Make us glad for the days you have humbled us,
\q2 for the evil years we have seen.
\q
\v 16 Let your servants see you in action,
\q2 show your majesty to their children.

\s Psalm 91 – In the Shelter of the Most High
\rem Revision 2
\q
\v 1 You whose home is the shelter of God Most High,
\q2 whose abode is the shadow of God Almighty,
\q
\v 2 can say to the \nd Lord\nd*, “My refuge, my fortress,
\q2 my God, in whom I trust.”
\b
\q
\v 3 For he saves you from fowler’s snare,
\q2 from deadly plague,
\q
\v 4 he shelters you with his pinions,
\q2 and under his wings you can hide.
\b
\q His truth will be a shield and buckler.
\b
\q
\v 5 You need not fear the terror of night,
\q2 nor the arrow that flies by day,
\q
\v 6 nor the plague that stalks in darkness,
\q2 nor the pestilence raging at noon.
\b
\q
\v 7 A thousand may fall at your side,
\q2 ten thousand at your right hand:
\q but it will not draw near to you.
\b
\q
\v 8 You will only look on with your eyes,
\q2 and see how the wicked are punished.
\q
\v 9 You have made the \nd Lord\nd* your refuge,
\q2 you have made the Most High your defence.
\b
\q
\v 10 You will never be met by misfortune,
\q2 no plague will come near your tent,
\q
\v 11 for he orders his angels to guard you,
\q2 wherever you go.
\b
\q
\v 12 They will carry you with their hands,
\q2 so you don’t hurt your foot on a stone.
\q
\v 13 You will trample down lions and snakes,
\q2 tread on young lions and cobras.
\b
\q
\v 14 “Because of their love for me, I will deliver them,
\q2 I will protect those who trust my name.
\q
\v 15 I will answer their cry and be with them in trouble,
\q2 bringing them forth into safety and honor.
\q
\v 16 I will give them a life of many days,
\q2 I will show them my salvation.”

\d A psalm. A song; for the sabbath day.
\q
\v 1 It is good to give thanks to the \nd Lord\nd*,
\q2 to sing praise to your name, O Most High,
\q
\v 2 to declare your love in the morning,
\q2 and your faithfulness in the night,
\q
\v 3 with voice and a ten-stringed harp,
\q2 with music that throbs on the lyre.
\q
\v 4 For you make me glad by your deeds, \nd Lord\nd*,
\q2 at the work of your hands I will ring out my joy.
\b
\q
\v 5 How great are your works, O \nd Lord\nd*;
\q2 how deep are your thoughts!
\q
\v 6 The insensitive cannot know,
\q2 nor can a fool understand,
\q
\v 7 that, though the wicked flourish like grass,
\q2 and evil-doers all blossom,
\q2 they will perish forever.
\b
\q
\v 8 But you are exalted forever.
\q
\v 9 For see! Your enemies, \nd Lord\nd*
\q2 For see! Your enemies perish,
\q2 all evil-doers are scattered.
\q
\v 10 But you lift me to honor,
\q2 and anoint me afresh with oil.
\q
\v 11 My eyes will feast on my foes,
\q2 and my ears will hear of the doom of the wicked.
\b
\q
\v 12 The righteous will sprout like the palm,
\q2  will grow like a cedar of Lebanon.
\q
\v 13 In the house of the \nd Lord\nd* are they planted,
\q2 in the courts of our God they will sprout.
\q
\v 14 They will still bear fruit in old age,
\q2 all sappy and fresh will they be
\q
\v 15 So they proclaim the \nd Lord\nd* to be just,
\q2 my rock, in whom is no wrong.

\q2
\v 2 firm stands your throne from all eternity.
\q3 You are from everlasting.

\q2 more grand than the ocean waves,
\q2 grand on the height stands the \nd Lord\nd*.

\s Psalm 94 – A Prayer for Vengeance on the Cruel
\q
\v 1 \nd Lord\nd*, God of vengeance,
\q2 God of vengeance, shine forth.
\q
\v 2 Rise up, judge of the earth,
\q2 pay back the proud what they deserve.
\b
\q
\v 3 \nd Lord\nd*, how long shall the wicked,
\q2 how long shall the wicked exult,
\q
\v 4 with their blustering arrogant words,
\q2 their braggart and wicked speech,
\q
\v 5 crushing your people, \nd Lord\nd*,
\q2 and afflicting your heritage,
\q
\v 6 murdering widows and strangers,
\q2 slaying the fatherless?
\q
\v 7 They think that the \nd Lord\nd* does not see,
\q2 nor the God of Jacob regard it.
\b
\q
\v 8 Take heed, you dullest of people;
\q2 when will you be wise, you fools?
\q
\v 9 Is he deaf, who shaped the ear?
\q2 Is he blind, who fashioned the eye?
\q
\v 10 Can he who trains nations not punish them
\q2 he who teaches knowledge to people?
\q
\v 11 The \nd Lord\nd* knows the thoughts of people,
\q2 that only a breath are they.
\b
\q
\v 12 Happy are those whom you chasten,
\q2 and teach out of your law,
\q
\v 13 keeping them calm in the day of misfortune,
\q2 till a pit be dug for the wicked.
\b
\q
\v 14 For the \nd Lord\nd* will not leave his people,
\q2 he will not forsake his inheritance.
\q
\v 15 For the righteous shall come to their rights,
\q2 and all true-hearted people shall follow them.
\b
\q
\v 16 Who will rise up for me against those who do evil?
\q2 Who will stand up for me against workers of wrong?
\q
\v 17 Were it not for the help of the \nd Lord\nd*,
\q2 I would soon have gone to the silent grave.
\q
\v 18 When I thought that my foot was slipping,
\q2 your kindness, \nd Lord\nd*, held me up.
\q
\v 19 When with cares my heart was crowded,
\q2 your comforts make me glad.
\b
\q
\v 20 Can corrupt justice be your ally,
\q2 framing mischief by statute?
\q
\v 21 They assail the life of the righteous,
\q2 and innocent blood condemn.
\q
\v 22 But the \nd Lord\nd* is my sure retreat,
\q2 my God is the rock of my refuge.
\q
\v 23 He will bring back their sin upon them,
\q2 for their wickedness he will destroy them;
\q2 the \nd Lord\nd* our God will destroy them.

\q
\v 7 For he is our God; and we

\v 8 “Do not harden your hearts as at Meribah,

\q2 though they had seen my deeds.

\q2 for that generation, so I said:

\q2 the earth quakes at the sight.
\q

\q2 before the \nd Lord\nd* of all the earth.
\q

\q
\v 8 Zion is glad at the tidings,

\q2 because of your judgments, \nd Lord\nd*.
\q
\v 9 For you are most high over all the earth,

\q2 have won him the victory.
\q
\v 2 The \nd Lord\nd* has made his victory known,
\q2 and revealed to the eyes of the nations his righteousness.
\q

\q2 They called to the \nd Lord\nd*, and he gave them answer.
\q
\v 7 He spoke to them in the pillar of cloud,
\q2 they kept his commands and the statute he gave them.
\q2
\v 8 \nd Lord\nd* our God, you gave them answer.
\q A God of forgiveness were you to them,
\q2 who suffered their deeds to go unpunished.
\q
\v 9 Exalt the \nd Lord\nd* our God;
\q2 bow down at his holy mountain.

\q
\v 1 If kindness and justice I sing,
\q2 making melody to you, \nd Lord\nd*.
\q
\v 2 I would look to the way that is blameless,
\q2 and make it my own.
\b
\q Within my own house I would walk
\q2 with an innocent heart.
\q
\v 3 I would never direct my eyes
\q2 to a thing that is base.
\b
\q The impulse to stray I abhor
\q2 it shall not cling to me.
\q
\v 4 Far from me be perverseness of heart,
\q2 or kinship with evil.
\b
\q
\v 5 Who slanders their neighbor in secret,
\q2 I bring them to silence:
\q haughty looks and proud hearts
\q2 I will not abide.
\b
\q
\v 6 I will favor the true in the land,
\q2 they shall live in my court.
\q Those who walk in a way that is blameless
\q2 will be my attendant.

\q
\v 7 No one will live in my house

\s Psalm 102 – A Prayer for Pity and for the Restoration of Zion
\q
\v 1 Hear my prayer, O \nd Lord\nd*;
\q2 let my cry for help come to you.
\q
\v 2 Hide not your face from me
\q2 in the day of my distress.
\q Incline your ear to me:
\q2 when I call, answer me speedily.
\b
\q
\v 3 For my days pass away like smoke:
\q2 my bones are burned through as with fire.
\q
\v 4 My heart is scorched, withered like grass;
\q2 I forget to eat my bread.
\q
\v 5 By reason of my loud groaning,
\q2 my flesh clings to my bones.
\b
\q
\v 6 Like a desert-owl of the wilderness,
\q2 like an owl among ruins am I.
\q
\v 7 I make my sleepless lament
\q2 like a bird on the house-top alone.
\q
\v 8 All the day wild foes revile me,
\q2 using my name for a curse.
\b
\q
\v 9 For ashes have been my bread,
\q2 and tears have been mixed with my cup.
\q
\v 10 Because of your passionate anger,
\q2 you did raise me, then hurl me to the ground.
\q
\v 11 My days come to an end, shadows lengthen,
\q2 I wither like grass.
\b
\q
\v 12 But you, O \nd Lord\nd*, are enthroned forever,
\q2 your fame endures to all generations.
\q
\v 13 You will arise and have pity on Zion;
\q2 it’s time to be gracious; her hour has come.
\q
\v 14 For even her stones are dear to your servants,
\q2 even the dust of her ruins they look on with love.
\b
\q
\v 15 Then the nations will revere the name of the \nd Lord\nd*
\q2 and all the kings of the earth his glory,
\q
\v 16 when the \nd Lord\nd* shall have built up Zion,
\q2 and revealed himself in his glory,
\q
\v 17 in response to the prayer of the destitute,
\q2 whose prayer he will not despise.
\b
\q
\v 18 Let this be recorded for ages to come,
\q2 that the \nd Lord\nd* may be praised by a people yet unborn.
\q
\v 19 For he shall look down from his holy height,
\q2 from the heavens the \nd Lord\nd* will gaze on the earth,
\q
\v 20 to hear the groans of the prisoner,
\q2 to free those who are doomed to die;
\q
\v 21 that people may recount the \nd Lord\nd*’s fame in Zion,
\q2 and the praise of him in Jerusalem,
\q
\v 22 when the nations are gathered together,
\q2 and the kingdoms, to worship the \nd Lord\nd*.
\b
\q
\v 23 He has broken my strength on the way,
\q2 he has shortened my days.
\q
\v 24 I will say, “My God, take me not hence
\q2 in the midst of my days.
\b
\q “Your years endure age after age.
\q2
\v 25 Of old you have founded the earth,
\q2 and the heavens are the work of your hands.
\q
\v 26 They shall perish; but you do stand.
\q2 They shall all wax old like a garment,
\q2 and change as a robe you will change them.
\q
\v 27 But you are the same, your years are endless.
\q2
\v 28 The children of your servants abide,
\q2 evermore shall their seed be before you.”

\d Of David.
\q
\v 1 O my soul, bless the \nd Lord\nd*;
\q2 and all that is in me, his holy name.
\q
\v 2 O my soul, bless the \nd Lord\nd*;
\q2 and forget not one of his benefits.
\q
\v 3 He pardons all your sins,
\q2 he heals all your diseases.
\q
\v 4 He ransoms your life from the pit,
\q2 he crowns you with kindness and pity.
\q
\v 5 He gives you your heart’s desire,
\q2 renewing your youth like the eagle’s.
\b
\q
\v 6 The \nd Lord\nd* executes justice –
\q2 and right for all who are wronged.
\q
\v 7 He revealed his ways to Moses,
\q2 his acts to the children of Israel.
\q
\v 8 Full of pity and grace is the \nd Lord\nd*,
\q2 patient, and rich in kindness:
\q
\v 9 he will not always chide,
\q2 nor cherish his anger forever.
\q
\v 10 Not after our sins has he dealt with us,
\q2 nor requited us after our wickedness.
\b
\q
\v 11 For high as the heavens o’er the earth
\q2 is his love over those who fear him.
\q
\v 12 Far as is east from the west
\q2 has he put our transgressions from us.
\q
\v 13 As a father pities his children,
\q2 so the \nd Lord\nd* pities those who fear him;
\q
\v 14 for well he knows our frame,
\q2 he remembers that we are dust.
\b
\q
\v 15 A person’s days are as grass;
\q2 blossoms like a flower of the meadow.
\q
\v 16 At the breath of the wind it is gone,
\q2 and the place thereof knows it no more.
\q
\v 17 But the love of the \nd Lord\nd* is eternal,
\q2 and his kindness to children’s children,
\q
\v 18 to those who keep his covenant
\q2 and mindfully do his behests.
\b
\q
\v 19 The \nd Lord\nd* has set his throne in the heavens;
\q2 the whole world is under his sway.
\q
\v 20 Bless the \nd Lord\nd*, you angels of his,
\q2 mighty heroes performing his word.
\q
\v 21 Bless the \nd Lord\nd*, all you his hosts,
\q2 you servants who do his will.
\q
\v 22 Bless the \nd Lord\nd*, all you his works,
\q2 far as his sway extends.
\q2 O my soul, bless the \nd Lord\nd*.

\c 104
\s Psalm 104 – The Hymn of Creation
\q
\v 1 Bless the \nd Lord\nd*, O my soul.
\q O \nd Lord\nd* my God, you are very great,
\q2 clad in awful splendor,
\q2
\v 2 covered with robe of light.
\q You stretch out the heavens like the cloth of a tent.
\q2
\v 3 He lays the beams of his chambers on water.
\q He takes dark clouds for his chariot,
\q2 and rides on the wings of the wind.
\q
\v 4 He takes the winds for his messengers,
\q2 the fire and the flame for his servants.
\b
\q
\v 5 He founded the earth upon pillars,
\q2 to sustain it unshaken forever.
\q
\v 6 With the garment of ocean he covered it,
\q2 waters towered over the mountains.
\q
\v 7 But at your rebuke they fled,
\q2 scared by the roar of your thunder,
\q
\v 8 mountains rose, valleys sank down
\q2 to the place appointed for them.
\q
\v 9 They dared not pass the bounds set for them,
\q2 or cover the earth any more.
\b
\q
\v 10 He sent brooks into the valleys,
\q2 they meander between the mountains.
\q
\v 11 The wild beasts all drink from them,
\q2 and the wild asses quench their thirst.
\q
\v 12 The birds have their home by the banks,
\q2 and sing in the branches.
\q
\v 13 From his chambers above he gives drink to the mountains,
\q2 and satisfies earth with the vials of heaven.
\b
\q
\v 14 He makes grass grow for the cattle,
\q2 and herbs for people.
\q He brings bread out of the earth;
\q2
\v 15 wine, to gladden hearts;
\q oil, to make faces shine;
\q2 bread, to strengthen hearts.
\q
\v 16 The trees of the \nd Lord\nd* drink their fill
\q2 the cedars he planted on Lebanon,
\q
\v 17 where the little birds build their nest,
\q2 and the stork whose home is the cypress.
\q
\v 18 The high hills are for the wild goats,
\q2 and the rocks are for coneys to hide in.
\b
\q
\v 19 He created the moon to mark seasons,
\q2 and told the sun when to set.
\q
\v 20 You make it dark: night comes,
\q2 when all the wild beasts creep out.
\q
\v 21 Young lions that roar for their prey,
\q2 seeking their meat from God.
\q
\v 22 At sunrise they slink away,
\q2 and lie down in their dens.
\q
\v 23 Then people go forth to their work,
\q2 and toil till evening.
\b
\q
\v 24 How many, O \nd Lord\nd*, are your works,
\q2 all of them made in wisdom!
\q2 The earth is filled with your creatures.
\q
\v 25 And there is the great broad sea,
\q2 where are countless things in motion,
\q2 living creatures, both great and small.
\q
\v 26 There go the ships,
\q2 and the Leviathan you made to play there.
\b
\q
\v 27 They all look in hope to you,
\q2 to give them their food in due season.
\q
\v 28 And you give with open hand;
\q2 they gather and eat to their heart’s desire.
\q
\v 29 When you hide your face, they are terrified;
\q2 when you take their breath away,
\q2 they die and go back to their dust.
\q
\v 30 But a breath from your lips creates them,
\q2 and renews the face of the earth.
\b
\q
\v 31 May the glory of the \nd Lord\nd* be forever,
\q2 may the \nd Lord\nd* rejoice in his works.
\q
\v 32 A glance of his makes the earth tremble,
\q2 a touch of his makes the hills smoke.
\q
\v 33 I will sing to the \nd Lord\nd* while I live,
\q2 I will play to my God while I am.
\q
\v 34 May my musing be sweet to him.
\q2 for I rejoice in the \nd Lord\nd*.
\q
\v 35 But may sinners be swept from the earth,
\q2 and the wicked vanish forever.
\q2 O my soul, bless the \nd Lord\nd*.
\q3 Hallelujah.

\s Psalm 105 – The Inspiration of the Past
\q
\v 1 Give thanks to the \nd Lord\nd*, call on his name:
\q2 make known his deeds among the nations.
\q
\v 2 Sing to him, make music to him,
\q2 tell of all his wondrous works.
\q
\v 3 Make your boast in his holy name,
\q2 be glad at heart, you who seek the \nd Lord\nd*.
\q
\v 4 Seek after the \nd Lord\nd* and his strength,
\q2 seek his face evermore.
\q
\v 5 Remember the wonders he did,
\q2 his portents, the judgments he uttered,
\q
\v 6 you who are offspring of Abraham, his servant,
\q2 the children of Jacob, his chosen ones.
\b
\q
\v 7 He is the \nd Lord\nd* our God:
\q2 in all the earth are his judgments.
\q
\v 8 He remembers forever his covenant,
\q2 his promise for a thousand generations
\q
\v 9 The covenant he made with Abraham,
\q2 the oath he swore to Isaac,
\q
\v 10 and confirmed as a statute to Jacob,
\q2 a pact everlasting to Israel
\q
\v 11 to give them the land of Canaan
\q2 as the lot which they should inherit.
\b
\q
\v 12 And when they were very few,
\q2 few and but pilgrims therein,
\q
\v 13 wandering from nation to nation,
\q2 journeying from people to people,
\q
\v 14 he allowed no one to oppress them,
\q2 even punishing kings for their sakes.
\q
\v 15 He forbade them to touch his anointed,
\q2 or do any hurt to his prophets.
\b
\q
\v 16 When he called down famine on the land,
\q2 and cut off the bread which sustained them,
\q
\v 17 he sent before them a man,
\q2 Joseph, who was sold as a slave.
\q
\v 18 His feet were galled with fetters,
\q2 he was laid in chains of iron,
\q
\v 19 till the time that his word came to pass,
\q2 the word of the \nd Lord\nd* that had tried him.
\b
\q
\v 20 The king sent and freed him,
\q2 the ruler of nations released him.
\q
\v 21 He made him lord of his household,
\q2 and ruler of all his possessions,
\q
\v 22 to admonish his princes at will
\q2 and instruct his elders in wisdom.
\b
\q
\v 23 Thus Israel came into Egypt,
\q2 Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham.
\q
\v 24 His people he made very fruitful,
\q2 and mightier than their foes.
\q
\v 25 He inspired them to hate his people,
\q2 and to deal with his servants craftily.
\b
\q
\v 26 He sent his servant Moses,
\q2 and Aaron whom he had chosen,
\q
\v 27 portents he wrought in Egypt,
\q2 and signs in the land of Ham.
\q
\v 28 Darkness he sent, and it fell:
\q2 yet they gave no heed to his word.
\b
\q
\v 29 He turned their waters into blood,
\q2 thus causing their fish to die.
\q
\v 30 Their land was alive with frogs,
\q2 swarming even in the royal chambers.
\q
\v 31 At his command came flies,
\q2 and lice in all their borders.
\q
\v 32 He gave them hail for rain
\q2 and fire that flashed through the land,
\q
\v 33 smiting their vines and figs,
\q2 breaking the trees of their border.
\b
\q
\v 34 At his command came locusts,
\q2 young locusts beyond all counting,
\q
\v 35 which ate every herb in the land,
\q2 ate up, too, the fruit of their ground.
\q
\v 36 He struck down in their land all the first-born,
\q2 the firstlings of all their strength
\q
\v 37 Then forth he led Israel with silver and gold,
\q2 and among his tribes no one was weary.
\b
\q
\v 38 Egypt was glad when they left,
\q2 for terror had fallen upon them.
\q
\v 39 He spread out a cloud to screen them,
\q2 and fire to give light in the night.
\q
\v 40 He sent quails at their entreaty,
\q2 and heavenly bread in abundance.
\q
\v 41 He opened the rock; waters gushed:
\q2 in the desert they ran like a river.
\q
\v 42 For he remembered his holy promise
\q2 to Abraham his servant.
\b
\q
\v 43 So he led out his people with joy,
\q2 his elect with a ringing cry.
\q
\v 44 And he gave them the lands of the nations,
\q2 the fruit of their toil for possession,
\q
\v 45 that so they might keep his statutes,
\q2 and be of his laws observant.
\q3 Hallelujah.

\c 106
\s Psalm 106 – The Nation’s Sin against the Lord
\q3
\v 1 Hallelujah!
\q Give thanks to the \nd Lord\nd* for his goodness,
\q2 for his kindness endures forever.
\q
\v 2 Who can describe his heroic deeds,
\q2 or publish all his praise?
\q
\v 3 Happy they who act justly,
\q2 and do righteousness evermore.
\b
\q
\v 4 Remember me, \nd Lord\nd*, as you remember your people,
\q2 and visit me with your gracious help.
\q
\v 5 May I see the good fortune of your elect,
\q2 may I share in the joy of your nation,
\q2 and in the pride of your heritage.
\b
\q
\v 6 We, like our fathers, have sinned,
\q2 we have done perversely and wickedly
\q
\v 7 In the land of Egypt our fathers,
\q2 all heedless of your wonders,
\q and unmindful of your great kindness,
\q2 at the Red Sea defied the Most High.
\q
\v 8 But true to his name he saved them,
\q2 in order to show his might.
\q
\v 9 He rebuked the Red Sea, and it dried;
\q2 they marched through the depths as through desert,
\q
\v 10 saved from the hand of the hostile,
\q2 redeemed from the hand of the foe.
\q
\v 11 The waters covered their enemies:
\q2 not one of them was left.
\q
\v 12 So then they believed in his words,
\q2 and began to sing his praise.
\b
\q
\v 13 But soon they forgot his deeds:
\q2 they did not wait for his counsel.
\q
\v 14 Their greed was ravenous in the desert;
\q2 they put God to the test in the wilderness.
\q
\v 15 He gave them the thing they had asked for,
\q2 but sent wasting disease among them.
\b
\q
\v 16 The camp grew jealous of Moses
\q2 and of Aaron, holy one of the \nd Lord\nd*.
\q
\v 17 The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan,
\q2 and covered Abiram’s company.
\q
\v 18 Fire broke out on their company,
\q2 flame kindled upon the wicked.
\b
\q
\v 19 They made a calf in Horeb,
\q2 and bowed to the molten image.
\q
\v 20 They exchanged their glorious God
\q2 for the image of ox that eats grass.
\q
\v 21 They forgot the God who had saved them
\q2 by mighty deeds in Egypt
\q
\v 22 Wonders in the land of Ham,
\q2 terrors by the Red Sea.
\q
\v 23 So he vowed, and would have destroyed them,
\q2 but for Moses his elect,
\q who stepped into the breach before him,
\q2 to divert his deadly wrath.
\b
\q
\v 24 They spurned the delightsome land,
\q2 they refused to believe in his word.
\q
\v 25 They grumbled in their tents,
\q2 would not listen to the voice of the \nd Lord\nd*.
\q
\v 26 So he swore with uplifted hand
\q2 to lay them low in the wilderness;
\q
\v 27 to disperse their seed among heathen,
\q2 to scatter them over the world.
\b
\q
\v 28 Then they joined them to Baal of Peor,
\q2 and ate what was offered the dead.
\q
\v 29 They provoked him to wrath by their deeds,
\q2 and plague broke out among them.
\q
\v 30 Then Phinehas stood between,
\q2 and so the plague was stayed;
\q
\v 31 and it was counted to him for righteousness
\q2 unto all generations forever.
\b
\q
\v 32 They angered him at the waters of Meribah,
\q2 through them it went ill with Moses.
\q
\v 33 They rebelled against his spirit,
\q2 and he uttered speech that was rash.
\b
\q
\v 34 They did not destroy the nations,
\q as the \nd Lord\nd* had commanded them;
\q2
\v 35 but they mingled with the heathen,
\q and learned to do as they did.
\q2
\v 36 Their idol gods they worshipped,
\q and they were ensnared by them.
\q2
\v 37 They sacrificed their sons
\q and their daughters to the demons.
\q2
\v 38 They poured out innocent blood
\q the blood of their sons and daughters
\q2 whom they offered to Canaan’s idols,
\q and the land was polluted with blood.
\q2
\v 39 They became unclean by their works,
\q and adulterous in their deeds.
\q2
\v 40 Then the \nd Lord\nd*’s fury was on his people,
\q filled with horror at his inheritance.
\q2
\v 41 He delivered them to the heathen,
\q to the sway of those who hated them.
\q2
\v 42 Their enemies oppressed them,
\q and subdued them under their hand.
\q2
\v 43 Many a time he saved them,
\q but they rebelled at his counsel,
\q2 and were brought low by their wrongdoing.
\q
\v 44 Yet he looked upon their distress,
\q2 when he heard their cry.
\q
\v 45 He remembered his covenant,
\q2 and, in his great kindness, relented.
\q
\v 46 He caused them to be pitied
\q2 by all who carried them captive.

\s Psalm 107 – The Song of the Redeemed
\q
\v 1 Give thanks to the \nd Lord\nd* for his goodness
\q2 for his kindness endures forever.
\q
\v 2 Let this be the song of the ransomed,
\q2 whom the \nd Lord\nd* has redeemed from distress,
\q
\v 3 gathering them from all lands,
\q2 east, west, north, and south.
\b
\q
\v 4 In the wastes of the desert some wandered,
\q2 finding no way to a city inhabited.
\q
\v 5 Full of hunger and thirst,
\q2 their spirit failed.
\q
\v 6 Then they cried to the \nd Lord\nd* in their trouble,
\q2 and he saved them from their distresses,
\q
\v 7 guiding them straight on the way,
\q2 till they reached an inhabited city.
\q
\v 8 Let them thank the \nd Lord\nd* for his kindness,
\q2 for his wonderful deeds for people;
\q
\v 9 for the thirsty he satisfies,
\q2 and the hungry he fills with good things.
\b
\q
\v 10 Some sat in darkness and gloom
\q2 prisoners in irons and misery,
\q
\v 11 for rebelling against God’s word,
\q2 and spurning the Most High’s counsel.
\q
\v 12 Their heart was bowed with toil;
\q2 there was no one to help when they stumbled.
\q
\v 13 Then they cried to the \nd Lord\nd* in their trouble,
\q2 and he saved them from their distresses.
\q
\v 14 Out of darkness and gloom he brought them,
\q2 and burst their chains.
\q
\v 15 Let them praise the \nd Lord\nd* for his kindness,
\q2 for his wonderful deeds for people.
\q
\v 16 For he shattered the gates of bronze,
\q2 and broke bars of iron.
\b
\q
\v 17 Some were sick from their wicked ways,
\q2 and suffering because of their sins.
\q
\v 18 All manner of food they hated;
\q2 they had come to the gates of death.
\q
\v 19 Then they cried to the \nd Lord\nd* in their trouble,
\q2 and he saved them from their distresses.
\q
\v 20 He sent his word and healed them,
\q2 and delivered their life from the pit.
\q
\v 21 Let them praise the \nd Lord\nd* for his kindness,
\q2 for his wonderful deeds for people.
\q
\v 22 Let them offer to him thankofferings,
\q2 and with joy tell what things he has done.
\b
\q
\v 23 Some crossed the sea in ships,
\q2 doing business in great waters.
\q
\v 24 They have seen what the \nd Lord\nd* can do,
\q2 and his wonderful deeds on the deep.
\q
\v 25 At his command rose a tempest,
\q2 which lifted the waves on high.
\q
\v 26 Up to heaven they went, down to the depths;
\q2 their courage failed them.
\q
\v 27 They staggered and reeled like drunkards;
\q2 all their skills useless.
\q
\v 28 Then they cried to the \nd Lord\nd* in their trouble,
\q2 and he saved them from their distresses.
\q
\v 29 He stilled the storm to a whisper,
\q2 and the waves of the sea were hushed.
\q
\v 30 They were glad, because it was quiet;
\q2 they were led to the haven they longed for.
\q
\v 31 Let them praise the \nd Lord\nd*, for his kindness,
\q2 for his wonderful deeds for people.
\q
\v 32 Where the people assemble, extol him,
\q2 and praise him in council of elders.
\b
\q
\v 33 He turns streams into a wilderness,
\q2 springs of water into thirsty land,
\q
\v 34 fruitful land into a salt waste,
\q2 because of the sin of the people.
\q
\v 35 A desert he makes pools of water,
\q2 a land of drought into springs of water.
\q
\v 36 He settles the hungry therein,
\q2 they establish a city to live in.
\q
\v 37 They sow fields and plant vineyards,
\q2 which furnish a fruitful yield.
\q
\v 38 By his blessing they multiply greatly,
\q2 and he lets not their cattle decrease.
\b
\q
\v 39 Yet when they are bowed and diminished
\q2 by oppression, misfortune, or sorrow,
\q
\v 40 he pours contempt upon princes,
\q2 and on trackless wastes leads them astray
\q
\v 41 He lifts the poor out of misery,
\q2 and makes families fruitful as flocks.
\q
\v 42 At this sight shall the upright be glad,
\q2 and all wicked mouths shall be stopped.
\q
\v 43 Let those who are wise observe this,
\q2 and consider the love of the \nd Lord\nd*

\q I would sing, I would make music;
\q2 awake, my soul.
\q
\v 2 Awake, harp and lyre;
\q2 I would wake the dawn.
\q
\v 3 I would praise you among the peoples, O \nd Lord\nd*;
\q2 make music among the nations to you.
\q
\v 4 For great to heaven is your love,
\q2 and your faithfulness to the clouds.
\q
\v 5 Be exalted, O God, o’er the heavens,
\q2 and your glory o’er all the earth.
\b
\q
\v 6 So those you love may be rescued,
\q2 save by your right hand and answer us.

\v 10 O to be brought to the fortified city!
\q2 O to be led into Edom!
\q
\v 11 Have you not spurned us, O God?
\q2 You do not march forth with our armies.

\v 2 for their wicked mouths they have opened against me,
\q2 they speak to me with tongues that are false,
\q
\v 3 they beset me with words of hatred,
\q2 and fight without cause against me.
\q
\v 4 My love they requite with hostility,
\q2 while for them I lift up my prayer.
\q
\v 5 Evil for good they reward me,
\q2 and hatred for my love.
\b
\q
\v 6 “Set over him one who is godless,” they say,
\q2 “an opponent at his right hand.
\q
\v 7 From his trial let him come forth guilty,
\q2 may his prayer be counted as sin.
\q
\v 8 Grant that his days may be few,
\q2 that his office be seized by another.
\q
\v 9 Grant that his children be fatherless,
\q2 and that his wife be a widow.
\q
\v 10 Up and down may his children go begging,
\q2 expelled from their desolate home.
\q
\v 11 May all that he owns be seized by the creditor
\q2 may strangers plunder the fruits of his toil.
\b
\q
\v 12 “May none extend to him kindness,
\q2 or pity his fatherless children.
\q
\v 13 His descendants be doomed to destruction!
\q2 Blotted out be his name in one generation!
\q
\v 14 May his father’s guilt be remembered,
\q2 and his mother’s sin not blotted out:
\q
\v 15 on record always before the \nd Lord\nd*,
\q2 and his memory root from the earth;
\q
\v 16 for he gave no thought to show kindness,
\q2 but pursued the poor and the needy,
\q2 drove the downhearted to death.
\b
\q
\v 17 “May the curses he loved light upon him,
\q2 may the blessings he loathed be afar.
\q
\v 18 Like a garment he clothed him with curses;
\q2 may they pierce to his inwards like water,
\q2 and cling to his bones like oil.
\q
\v 19 Let them be like the robe he wraps round him,
\q2 like the belt he wears every day.”

\q

\q2 I am shaken off like a locust.
\q

\v 26 Help me, O \nd Lord\nd* my God,

\q
\v 27 Teach them that this is your hand,

\q
\v 28 Let them curse, if only you bless.
\q2 Put my assailants to shame,
\q2 and make your servant glad.
\q
\v 29 My opponents be clothed with dishonor,
\q2 and wrapped in a robe of shame.
\b
\q
\v 30 I give thanks to you, \nd Lord\nd*, with loud voice,

\q
\v 12 Blessed are you, O \nd Lord\nd*;
\q2 teach me your statutes.
\q
\v 13 With my lips have I rehearsed
\q2 all the judgments of your mouth.
\q
\v 14 I delight in the way of your charges,
\q2 more than in riches of all sorts.
\q
\v 15 I will muse upon your precepts,
\q2 and look to your paths.
\q
\v 16 In your statutes I delight,
\q2 I will not forget your word.
\b
\q
\v 17 Grant that your servant may live,
\q2 and I will observe your word.
\q
\v 18 Open my eyes, that I see
\q2 wondrous things out of your law.
\q
\v 19 But a guest am I on the earth:
\q2 hide not your commandments from me.
\q
\v 20 My heart is crushed with longing
\q2 for your ordinances, at all times.
\q
\v 21 You rebuke the proud, the accursed,
\q2 who wander from your commandments.
\q
\v 22 Roll away from me scorn and contempt,
\q2 for I have observed your charges.
\q
\v 23 Though princes sit plotting against me,
\q2 your servant will muse on your statutes.
\q
\v 24 Your charges are my delight,
\q2 they are my counsellors.
\b
\q
\v 25 I lie grovelling in the dust;
\q2 revive me, as you have promised.
\q
\v 26 I told of my ways, you made answer;
\q2 teach me your statutes.
\q
\v 27 Grant me insight into your precepts,
\q2 and I will muse on your wonders.
\q
\v 28 I am overcome with sorrow;
\q2 raise me up, as you have promised.
\q
\v 29 Put the way of falsehood from me,
\q2 and graciously grant me your law.
\q
\v 30 I have chosen the way of fidelity,
\q2 your ordinances I long for.
\q
\v 31 I hold fast to your charges:
\q2 O put me not, \nd Lord\nd*, to shame.
\q
\v 32 I will run in the way of your commandments,
\q2 for you give me room of heart.
\b
\q
\v 33 Teach me, O \nd Lord\nd*, the way of your statutes,
\q2 and I will keep it to the end,
\q
\v 34 instruct me to keep your law,
\q2 and I will observe it with all my heart.
\q
\v 35 Guide me in the path of your commandments,
\q2 for therein do I delight.
\q
\v 36 Incline my heart to your charges,
\q2 and not to greed of gain.
\q
\v 37 Turn away my eyes from vain sights,
\q2 revive me by your word.
\q
\v 38 Confirm to your servant the promise
\q2 which is given to those who fear you.
\q
\v 39 Remove the reproach which I dread,
\q2 because your judgments are good.
\q
\v 40 Behold, I long for your precepts.
\q2 Quicken me in your righteousness.
\b
\q
\v 41 Visit me, \nd Lord\nd*, with your love
\q2 and salvation, as you have promised.
\q
\v 42 So shall I answer my slanderers,
\q2 for my trust is in your word.
\q
\v 43 Snatch not from my mouth the word of truth,
\q2 for in your judgments I hope.
\q
\v 44 I will keep your law continually,
\q2 for ever and evermore.
\q
\v 45 So shall I walk in wide spaces,
\q2 for I give my mind to your precepts.
\q
\v 46 I will speak of your charge before kings,
\q2 and will not be ashamed thereof.
\q
\v 47 Your commandments are my delight,
\q2 I love them exceedingly.
\q
\v 48 I will lift up my hands to your commandments,
\q2 and muse upon your statutes.
\b
\q
\v 49 Remember your word to your servant,
\q2 on which you have made me to hope.
\q
\v 50 This is my comfort in trouble,
\q2 that your word gives life to me.
\q
\v 51 The arrogant utterly scorn me,
\q2 but I have not declined from your law.
\q
\v 52 When I think of your judgments of old,
\q2 O \nd Lord\nd*, I take to me comfort.
\q
\v 53 I am seized with glowing anger
\q2 at the wicked who forsake your law.
\q
\v 54 Your statutes have been to me songs
\q2 in the house of my pilgrimage.
\q
\v 55 I remember your name in the night,
\q2 O \nd Lord\nd* and observe your law.
\q
\v 56 My lot has been this,
\q2 that I have kept your precepts.
\b
\q
\v 57 My portion are you, O \nd Lord\nd*:
\q2 I have promised to keep your words.
\q
\v 58 I entreat you with all my heart;
\q2 grant me your promised favor.
\q
\v 59 I have thought upon my ways,
\q2 and turned my feet to your charges.
\q
\v 60 I hasted and tarried not
\q2 to give heed to your commandments.
\q
\v 61 Though the godless have wound their cords round me,
\q2 I have not forgotten your law.
\q
\v 62 At midnight I rise to praise you
\q2 because of your righteous judgments.
\q
\v 63 With all those who fear you I company,
\q2 aid with those who observe your precepts.
\q
\v 64 The earth, \nd Lord\nd*, is full of your kindness;
\q2 teach me your Statutes.
\b
\q
\v 65 Well have you dealt with your servant,
\q2 as you have promised, O \nd Lord\nd*.
\q
\v 66 Teach me discretion and knowledge,
\q2 for I have believed your commandments.
\q
\v 67 Till trouble came I was a wanderer,
\q2 but now I observe your word.
\q
\v 68 You are good and do good;
\q2 teach me your statutes.
\q
\v 69 The proud have forged lies against me,
\q2 but I keep your precepts with all my heart.
\q
\v 70 Their heart is gross like fat,
\q2 but I delight in your law.
\q
\v 71 It was good for me to be humbled,
\q2 that I should learn your statutes.
\q
\v 72 The law of your mouth is better to me
\q2 than thousands of pieces of silver and gold.
\b
\q
\v 73 Your hands have made me and fashioned me;
\q2 make me wise to learn your commandments.
\q
\v 74 Those who fear you shall see me with joy,
\q2 for in your word have I hoped.
\q
\v 75 I know, O \nd Lord\nd*, that your judgments are right,
\q2 and in faithfulness you have afflicted me.
\q
\v 76 Let your love be a comfort to me,
\q2 for so have you promised your servant.
\q
\v 77 Visit me with your quickening pity,
\q2 for your law is my delight.
\q
\v 78 Put the proud to shame, who have wronged me falsely:
\q2 I will muse on your precepts.
\q
\v 79 Let those turn to me who fear you,
\q2 that they may learn your charges.
\q
\v 80 Let my heart be sound in your statutes,
\q2 that I may not be put to shame.
\b
\q
\v 81 My long for you to rescue me,
\q2 I put my hope in your word.
\q
\v 82 My eyes pine away for your promise:
\q2 saying, “When will you comfort me?”
\q
\v 83 Though shrivelled like wine-skin in smoke,
\q2 your statutes I have not forgotten.
\q
\v 84 How few are the days of your servant!
\q2 When will you judge those who harass me?
\q
\v 85 Proud people have dug for me pits
\q2 people who do not conform to your law.
\q
\v 86 All your commandments are trusty.
\q2 With falsehood they harass me: help me.
\q
\v 87 They had nearly made an end of me,
\q2 yet I did not forget your precepts.
\q
\v 88 Spare me in your kindness,
\q2 and I will observe the charge of your mouth.
\b
\q
\v 89 Forever, O \nd Lord\nd*, is your word
\q2 fixed firmly in the heavens.
\q
\v 90 Your truth endures age after age;
\q2 it is established on earth, and it stands.
\q
\v 91 By your appointment they stand this day,
\q2 for all are your servants.
\q
\v 92 Had not your law been my joy,
\q2 in my misery then had I perished.
\q
\v 93 I will never forget your precepts,
\q2 for through them you have put life in me.
\q
\v 94 I am yours, O save me,
\q2 for I give my mind to your precepts.
\q
\v 95 The wicked lay wait to destroy me,
\q2 but I give heed to your charge.
\q
\v 96 I have seen a limit to all things:
\q2 but your commandment is spacious exceedingly.
\b
\q
\v 97 O how I love your law!
\q2 All the day long I muse on it.
\q
\v 98 Your commandment makes me wiser than my enemies:
\q2 for it is mine forever.
\q
\v 99 I am prudent above all my teachers,
\q2 for your charges are my meditation.
\q
\v 100 I have insight more than the aged,
\q2 because I observe your precepts.
\q
\v 101 I refrain my foot from all wicked ways,
\q2 that I may keep your word.
\q
\v 102 I turn not aside from your judgments,
\q2 for you yourself are my teacher.
\q
\v 103 How sweet are your words to my taste,
\q2 sweeter than honey to my mouth!
\q
\v 104 Insight I win through your precepts,
\q2 therefore every false way I hate.
\b
\q
\v 105 Your word is a lamp to my feet,
\q2 and a light to my path.
\q
\v 106 I have sworn an oath, and will keep it,
\q2 to observe your righteous judgments.
\q
\v 107 I am afflicted sorely:
\q2 revive me, O \nd Lord\nd*, as you said.
\q
\v 108 Accept, \nd Lord\nd*, my willing praise,
\q2 and teach me your judgments.
\q
\v 109 My life is in ceaseless peril;
\q2 but I do not forget your law.
\q
\v 110 The wicked set traps for me,
\q2 yet I do not stray from your precepts.
\q
\v 111 In your charges are my everlasting inheritance,
\q2 they are the joy of my heart.
\q
\v 112 I am resolved to perform your statutes
\q2 forever, to the utmost.
\b
\q
\v 113 I hate people of divided heart,
\q2 but your law do I love.
\q
\v 114 You are my shelter and shield:
\q2 in your word do I hope.
\q
\v 115 Begone, you wicked people,
\q2 I will keep the commands of my God.
\q
\v 116 Uphold me and spare me, as you have promised:
\q2 O disappoint me not.
\q
\v 117 Hold me up, and I shall be saved:
\q2 and your statutes shall be my unceasing delight.
\q
\v 118 All who swerve from your statutes you spurn:
\q2 their cunning is in vain.
\q
\v 119 All the wicked of earth you count as dross,
\q2 therefore I love your charges.
\q
\v 120 My flesh, for fear of you, shudders,
\q2 and I stand in awe of your judgments.
\b
\q
\v 121 Justice and right have I practised,
\q2 do not leave me to my oppressors.
\q
\v 122 Be your servant’s surety for good,
\q2 let not the proud oppress me.
\q
\v 123 My eyes pine for your salvation,
\q2 and for your righteous promise.
\q
\v 124 Deal in your love with your servant,
\q2 and teach me your statutes.
\q
\v 125 Your servant am I; instruct me,
\q2 that I may know your charges.
\q
\v 126 It is time for the \nd Lord\nd* to act:
\q2 they have violated your law.
\q
\v 127 Therefore I love your commandments
\q2 above gold, above fine gold.
\q
\v 128 So by all your precepts I guide me,
\q2 and every false way I hate.
\b
\q
\v 129 Your decrees are wonderful,
\q2 gladly I keep them.
\q
\v 130 When your word is unfolded, light breaks;
\q2 it imparts to the simple wisdom.
\q
\v 131 With open mouth I pant
\q2 with longing for your commandments.
\q
\v 132 Turn to me with your favor,
\q2 as is just to those who love you.
\q
\v 133 Steady my steps by your word,
\q2 so that sin have no power over me.
\q
\v 134 Set me free from those who oppress me,
\q2 and I shall observe your precepts.
\q
\v 135 Shine with your face on your servant,
\q2 and teach me your statutes.
\q
\v 136 My eyes run down with rills of water,
\q2 because your law is not kept.
\b
\q
\v 137 Righteous are you, O \nd Lord\nd*,
\q2 and right are your ordinances.
\q
\v 138 The laws you has ordered are just,
\q2 and trusty exceedingly.
\q
\v 139 My jealousy has undone me,
\q2 that my foes have forgotten your words.
\q
\v 140 Your word has been tested well;
\q2 and your servant loves it.
\q
\v 141 I am little and held in contempt,
\q2 but your precepts I have not forgotten.
\q
\v 142 Just is your justice forever,
\q2 and trusty is your law.
\q
\v 143 Stress and strain are upon me,
\q2 but your commandments are my delight.
\q
\v 144 Right are your charges forever,
\q2 instruct me that I may live.
\b
\q
\v 145 With my whole heart I cry; O answer me.
\q2 I would keep your statutes, O \nd Lord\nd*.
\q
\v 146 I cry to you: O save me,
\q2 and I will observe your charges.
\q
\v 147 Ere the dawn I cry for your help:
\q2 in your word do I hope.
\q
\v 148 Awake I meet the night-watches,
\q2 to muse upon your sayings.
\q
\v 149 Hear my voice in your kindness:
\q2 O \nd Lord\nd*, by your judgments revive me.
\q
\v 150 Near me are wicked tormentors,
\q2 who are far from thoughts of your law;
\q
\v 151 but near, too, are you, O \nd Lord\nd*,
\q2 and all your commandments are trusty.
\q
\v 152 Long have I known from your charges
\q2 that you have founded them for all time.
\b
\q
\v 153 Look on my misery, and rescue me;
\q2 for I do not forget your law.
\q
\v 154 Defend my cause and redeem me:
\q2 revive me, as you have promised.
\q
\v 155 Salvation is far from the wicked,
\q2 for their mind is not in your statutes.
\q
\v 156 Great is your pity, O \nd Lord\nd*:
\q2 Revive me, as you have ordained.
\q
\v 157 My foes and tormentors are many,
\q2 but I have not declined from your charges.
\q
\v 158 I behold the traitors with loathing,
\q2 for they do not observe your word.
\q
\v 159 Behold how I love your precepts:
\q2 revive me, O \nd Lord\nd*!, in your kindness.
\q
\v 160 The sum of your word is truth,
\q2 all your laws are just and eternal.
\b
\q
\v 161 Princes have harassed me wantonly:
\q2 but my heart stands in awe of your word.
\q
\v 162 Over your word I rejoice
\q2 as one who finds great spoil.
\q
\v 163 Falsehood I hate and abhor,
\q2 but your law do I love.
\q
\v 164 Seven times a day do I praise you
\q2 because of your righteous judgments.
\q
\v 165 Right well do they fare who love your law:
\q2 they go on their way without stumbling.
\q
\v 166 I hope for your salvation;
\q2 O \nd Lord\nd* I do your commandments.
\q
\v 167 I observe your charges:
\q2 I love them greatly.
\q
\v 168 I observe your precepts and charges:
\q2 all my ways are before you.
\b
\q
\v 169 Let my cry come before you, O \nd Lord\nd*:
\q2 give me insight, as you have promised.
\q
\v 170 Let my prayer enter into your presence:
\q2 deliver me, as you have said.
\q
\v 171 My lips shall be fountains of praise,
\q2 that you teach me your statutes.
\q
\v 172 My tongue shall sing of your word,
\q2 for all your commandments are right.
\q
\v 173 Let your hand be ready to help me,
\q2 for your precepts have been my choice.
\q
\v 174 I long, \nd Lord\nd*, for your salvation,
\q2 and your law is my delight.
\q
\v 175 Revive me that I may praise you,
\q2 and let your precepts help me.
\q
\v 176 I have strayed like a wandering sheep
\q2 seek your servant, because
\q2 I do not forget your commandments.

\q2 all his sufferings,
\q
\v 2 the oath that he swore to the \nd Lord\nd*,
\q2 and his vow to the Strong One of Jacob,
\q
\v 3 never to enter his tent,
\q2 never to lie on his bed,
\q
\v 4 never to give his eyes sleep
\q2 or his eyelids slumber,
\q
\v 5 till he had found a place for the \nd Lord\nd*,
\q2 for the Strong One of Jacob to live in.
\b
\q
\v 6 We heard of it in Ephrathah,
\q2 in the fields of Jaar we found it.
\q
\v 7 We went to the place where he dwelt,
\q2 we bowed ourselves low at his footstool.
\q
\v 8 “Arise, \nd Lord\nd*, and enter your resting-place,
\q2 you and your mighty ark.
\q
\v 9 Let your priests wear a garment of righteousness,
\q2 your faithful shout aloud for joy.
\q
\v 10 For the sake of David your servant,
\q2 do not reject your Anointed.”
\b
\q
\v 11 The \nd Lord\nd* swore an oath to David
\q2 an oath that he will not break;
\q “I will set on your throne
\q2 a prince of your line.
\q
\v 12 If your sons keep my covenant
\q2 and the statutes I teach them,
\q then their sons, too, forever,
\q2 will sit on your throne.”
\q
\v 13 For the choice of the \nd Lord\nd* is Zion;
\q2 she is the home of his heart.
\b
\q
\v 14 “This is forever my resting-place,
\q2 this is the home of my heart.
\q
\v 15 I will royally bless her provision,
\q2 and give bread to her poor in abundance.
\q
\v 16 Her priests I will clothe with salvation;
\q2 her faithful will shout for joy.
\q
\v 17 There will I raise up for David
\q2 a dynasty of power.
\q I have set my anointed a lamp
\q2 that shall never go out.
\q
\v 18 Robes of shame I will put on his foes,
\q2 but on his head a glittering crown.”

\q2 that ran down on the beard,
\q the beard of Aaron, running
\q2 over the collar of his robe:

\b
\q
\v 8 The first-born of Egypt he struck,
\q2 both humans and animals.
\q
\v 9 Signs and wonders he sent
\q2 into your midst, O Egypt,
\q2 upon Pharaoh and all his servants.

\q
\v 12 He gave their land for possession,

\b
\q
\v 15 The idols of heathen are silver

\q
\v 16 They have mouths, but cannot speak:

\s Psalm 137 – By the Waters of Babylon
\rem Revision 2
\q
\v 1 By the waters of Babylon there we sat,
\q2 and we wept at the thought of Zion.
\q
\v 2 There on the poplars we hung our harps.
\q2
\v 3 For there our captors called for a song:
\q our tormentors, rejoicing, saying:
\q2 “Sing us one of the songs of Zion.”
\b
\q
\v 4 How can we sing the \nd Lord\nd*’s song
\q2 in the foreigner’s land?
\q
\v 5 If I forget you, Jerusalem,
\q2 may my right hand wither.
\q2
\v 6 May my tongue stick to the roof of my mouth,
\q if I am unmindful of you,
\q2 or don’t set Jerusalem
\q2 above my chief joy.
\b
\q
\v 7 Remember the Edomites, \nd Lord\nd*,
\q2 the day of Jerusalem’s fall,
\q when they said, “Lay her bare, lay her bare,
\q2 right down to her very foundation.”
\b
\q
\v 8 Babylon, despoiler,
\q2 happy are those who pay you back
\q2 for all you have done to us.
\q
\v 9 Happy are they who seize and dash
\q2 your children against the rocks.

\v 1 I will thank you, O \nd Lord\nd*, with all my heart:
\q2 in the sight of the gods I will sing your praise,
\q
\v 2 and prostrate before your holy temple,
\q2 will praise your name for your constant love,
\q2 for you have exulted your promise above all.
\b
\q
\v 3 When I called you, you answered;
\q2 you gave me strength, you inspired me.
\q
\v 4 All the kings of the earth shall praise you, O \nd Lord\nd*,
\q2 when they shall have heard the words you have uttered;
\q
\v 5 and they shall sing of the ways of the \nd Lord\nd*,
\q2 and tell of the \nd Lord\nd*’s transcendent glory.
\q
\v 6 For, high though the \nd Lord\nd* is, he looks on the lowly,
\q2 and strikes down the haughty from far away.
\b
\q
\v 7 Though my way be distressful, yet you preserve me:
\q2 you lay your hand on my angry foes,
\q2 and your right hand gives me victory.
\q

\s Psalm 139 – The Ever-Present God
\d For the leader. Of David, a psalm.
\q
\v 1 O \nd Lord\nd*, you search and know me;
\q2
\v 2 when I sit, when I rise you know it,
\q you perceive my thoughts from afar.
\b
\q
\v 3 When I walk, when I lie you sift it,
\q2 familiar with all my ways.
\q
\v 4 There is not a word on my tongue,
\q2 but see! \nd Lord\nd*, you know it all.
\b
\q
\v 5 Behind and before you beset me,
\q2 upon me you lay your hand.
\q
\v 6 It’s too wonderful for me to know
\q2 too lofty I cannot attain it.
\b
\q
\v 7 Whither shall I go from your spirit?
\q2 Or whither shall I flee from your face?
\q
\v 8 If I climb up to heaven, you are there:
\q2 or make Sheol my bed, you are there.
\b
\q
\v 9 If I lift up the wings of the morning
\q2 and fly to the end of the sea,
\q
\v 10 there also your hand would grasp me,
\q2 and your right hand take hold of me.
\b
\q
\v 11 If I say, “Let the darkness cover me,
\q2 and night be the light about me,”
\q
\v 12 The dark is not dark for you,
\q2 but night is as light as the day.
\b
\q
\v 13 For you did put me together;
\q2 in my mother’s womb you did weave me.
\q
\v 14 I give you praise for my fashioning
\q2 so full of awe, so wonderful.
\q2 Your works are wonderful.
\b
\q You knew me right well;
\q2
\v 15 my bones were not hidden from you,
\q when I was made in secret,
\q2 and woven in the depths of the earth.
\b
\q
\v 16 Your eyes saw all my days:
\q2 they stood on your book every one
\q written down, before they were fashioned,
\q2 while none of them yet was mine.
\b
\q
\v 17 But how far, O God, beyond measure
\q2 are your thoughts! How mighty their sum!
\q
\v 18 Should I count, they are more than the sand.
\q2 When I wake, I am still with you.
\b
\q
\v 19 Will you slay the wicked, O God?
\q2 And remove from me the bloodthirsty,
\q
\v 20 who maliciously defy you
\q2 and take your name in vain.
\b
\q
\v 21 Do I not hate those who hate you, \nd Lord\nd*?
\q2 Do I not loathe those who resist you?
\q
\v 22 With perfect hatred I hate them,
\q2 I count them my enemies.
\b
\q
\v 23 Search me, O God, know my heart:
\q2 test me, and know my thoughts,
\q
\v 24 and see if guile be in me;
\q2 and lead me in the way everlasting.

\q
\v 2 from those who plot evil in their heart,

\q
\v 4 Preserve me, O \nd Lord\nd*, from the hands of the wicked,
\q2 from the violent guard me
\q2 from those who are plotting to trip up my feet.
\q
\v 5 The proud have hidden a trap for me,
\q2 cords they have spread as a net for my feet:
\q2 snares they have set at the side of my track. \qs Selah\qs*
\b
\q
\v 6 I have said to the \nd Lord\nd*, “My God are you;
\q2 give ear, \nd Lord\nd*, to my loud plea.
\q
\v 7 O \nd Lord\nd* my \nd Lord\nd*, my savior mighty,
\q2 you did cover my head in the day of battle.

\q
\v 9 Let them not lift up their heads against me.
\q2 May the mischief they prate bring themselves to destruction,

\v 10 may he rain upon them coals of fire,
\q2 may he strike them down swiftly, to rise no more,
\q
\v 11 no place in the land may there be for the slanderer:
\q2 may the violent be hunted from sorrow to sorrow.
\b
\q
\v 12 I know that the \nd Lord\nd* will do right by the weak,

\b
\q
\v 3 Set, O \nd Lord\nd*, a watch on my mouth,
\q2 put a guard on the door of my lips.
\q
\v 4 Incline not my heart to an evil matter,

\q in company with workers of evil:
\q2 never may I partake of their dainties.
\b
\q
\v 5 A wound or reproof from a good person in kindness
\q2 is oil which my head shall never refuse.
\q2 In their misfortune my prayer is still with them.
\b
\q
\v 6 Abandoned they are to the hands of their judges:
\q2 they shall learn that my words are true.
\b
\q
\v 7 Like stones on a country road cleft and broken
\q2 so lie our bones scattered for Death to devour.
\q
\v 8 But my eyes are turned towards you, O \nd Lord\nd*.
\q2 Do not pour out my life, for in you I take refuge.
\q
\v 9 Keep me safe from the trap they have laid for me,

\v 1 Hallelujah.
\q It is good to sing praise to our God,
\q2 for praise is sweet and seemly.

\q
\v 3 He heals the broken in heart,
\q2 and binds up their wounds.
\q

\q2 he gives names to them all.

\q2 the young ravens when they cry.

\q2 his word runs very swiftly.
\q
\v 16 Snow he gives like wool,
\q2 frost he scatters like ashes.
\q
\v 17 He casts forth his ice like morsels:
\q2 who can stand before his cold?
\q
\v 18 He sends forth his word, and melts them:
\q2 his wind blows the waters flow.
\b
\q
\v 19 He declares his word to Jacob,
\q2 his statutes and judgments to Israel.
\q
\v 20 No other nation did he do this for,
\q2 they know nothing of his judgments.

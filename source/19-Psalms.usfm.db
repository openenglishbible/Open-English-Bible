\s Psalm 1 – The Way of Happiness
\rem Revision 2
\q
\v 1 Happy [neut:are those|masc:the man who goes on his way,]
\q2 [neut:who do not follow the counsel of the wicked|masc:unheeding the counsels that wicked men offer],
\q not halting in ways frequented by sinners,
\q2 nor taking [neut:a|masc:his] seat in a gathering of scoffers.
\q
\v 2 But the law of the \nd Lord\nd* is [neut:their|masc:his] joy,
\q2 [neut:they study|masc:he studies] it day and night.
\q
\v 3 [neut:They are like trees|masc:For he is like a tree]
\q2 planted by runlets of water,
\q yielding fruit in due season,
\q2 leaves never fading.
\q2 In all that [neut:they do|masc:he does], [neut:they prosper|masc:he prospers].
\b
\q
\v 4 Not so fare the wicked, not so;
\q2 like chaff are they, blown by the wind.
\q
\v 5 So the wicked will not stand firm in the judgment,
\q2 nor sinners appear, when the righteous are gathered.
\q
\v 6 For the way of the righteous is dear to the \nd Lord\nd*,
\q2 but the way of the wicked will end in ruin.

\s Psalm 2 – The Lord's Chosen King
\rem Revision 2
\q
\v 1 Why this turmoil of nations,
\q2 this futile plotting of peoples,
\q
\v 2 with kings of the earth conspiring,
\q2 and rulers consulting together,
\q2 against the \nd Lord\nd* and against his anointed,
\q
\v 3 to snap their bonds
\q2 and fling their cords away?
\b
\q
\v 4 He whose throne is in heaven laughs,
\q2 the \nd Lord\nd* mocks them.
\q
\v 5 Then he speaks to them in his wrath,
\q2 and in his hot anger confounds them.
\q
\v 6 “This my king is installed by me,
\q2 on Zion my holy mountain.”
\b
\q
\v 7 I will tell of the \nd Lord\nd*'s decree.
\q He said to me: “You are my son,
\q2 this day I became your father.
\q
\v 8 Only ask, and I make you the heir of the nations,
\q2 and lord of the world to its utmost bounds.
\q
\v 9 You will break them with sceptre of iron,
\q2 shatter them like pottery.”
\b
\q
\v 10 So now, you kings, be wise:
\q2 be warned, you rulers of earth.
\q
\v 11 Serve the \nd Lord\nd* in awe,
\q2 kiss his feet with trembling,
\q
\v 12 lest, angry, he hurl you to ruin;
\q2 for soon will his fury blaze.
\q2 Happy all who take refuge in him.

\s Psalm 3 – A Morning Prayer for Protection
\rem Revision 2
\d A psalm of David, when he fled from his son Absalom.
\q
\v 1 How many, \nd Lord\nd*, are my foes!
\q2 Those who rise up against me are many.
\q
\v 2 Many are those who say of me,
\q2 “There is no help for him in his God.” \qs Selah\qs*
\b
\q
\v 3 But you, \nd Lord\nd*, are shield about me,
\q2 my glory, who lifts up my head.
\q
\v 4 When loudly I call to the \nd Lord\nd*,
\q2 from his holy hill he gives answer. \qs Selah\qs*
\b
\q
\v 5 I laid down and slept:
\q2 now I wake, for the \nd Lord\nd* sustains me.
\q
\v 6 I fear not the myriads of people
\q2 who beset me on every side.
\b
\q
\v 7 Arise, \nd Lord\nd*: save me, my God,
\q2 who strikes all my foes on the cheek,
\q2 and shatters the teeth of the wicked.
\q
\v 8 Victory belongs to the \nd Lord\nd*:
\q2 let your blessing descend on your people. \qs Selah\qs*

\s Psalm 4 – An Evening Prayer
\rem Revision 2
\d For the leader, with stringed instruments. A psalm of David.
\q
\v 1 Answer my cry,
\q2 God, my defender.
\q Often from straits you have brought me
\q2 to spacious places.
\q So now show me your [us:favor|cth:favour]
\q2 and hear my prayer.
\b
\q
\v 2 How long, you proud [neut:people|masc:men],
\q2 will my [us:honor|cth:honour] be stained
\q by the slanders you love,
\q2 and the lies that you follow? \qs Selah\qs*
\q
\v 3 See! The \nd Lord\nd* has shown me
\q2 his wonderful kindness:
\q the \nd Lord\nd* hears,
\q2 when I call to him.
\b
\q
\v 4 Sin not in your anger:
\q2 but speak in your heart
\q2 on your bed, and be still. \qs Selah\qs*
\q
\v 5 Offer true sacrifice,
\q2 trust in the \nd Lord\nd*.
\b
\q
\v 6 Many are longing
\q2 for fortune to smile.
\q Lift upon us
\q2 the light of your face.
\q
\v 7 You have put in my heart, \nd Lord\nd*,
\q2 a deeper joy
\q than was theirs who had corn
\q2 and wine in abundance.
\b
\q
\v 8 So in peace I will
\q2 lie down and sleep;
\q for you, \nd Lord\nd*, keep me
\q2 safe.

\s Psalm 5 – A Prayer for Guidance
\rem Revision 2
\d For the leader: A psalm of David, to be accompanied by the flute.
\q
\v 1 Hear my words, \nd Lord\nd*:
\q2 give heed to my whisper.
\q
\v 2 Attend to my loud cry for help,
\q2 my king and my God.
\q
\v 3 When I pray to you, \nd Lord\nd*, in the morning,
\q2 hear my voice.
\q I make ready for you in the morning,
\q2 and look for a sign.
\b
\q
\v 4 For you are no God who takes pleasure in wickedness:
\q2 no one of evil can be your guest.
\q
\v 5 No braggarts can stand in your presence,
\q2 you hate all workers of wrong.
\q
\v 6 You destroy all speakers of lies,
\q2 [neut:people|masc:men] of blood and deceit you abhor.
\q
\v 7 But I, through your kindness abundant,
\q2 may enter your house,
\q and towards the shrine of your temple
\q2 may reverently bow.
\b
\q
\v 8 Lead me, \nd Lord\nd*, in your righteousness
\q2 because of my enemies.
\q2 Make your way level before me.
\q
\v 9 For their mouth is a stranger to truth,
\q2 their heart is a pit of destruction.
\q Their throat is a wide open grave,
\q2 their tongue the smooth tongue of the hypocrite.
\b
\q
\v 10 Condemn them, God;
\q2 let their schemes bring them down to the ground.
\q For their numberless crimes thrust them down
\q2 for playing the rebel against you.
\q
\v 11 But let all who take refuge in you
\q2 ring out their gladness forever.
\q Protect those who love your name,
\q2 so they may exult in you.
\q
\v 12 For you give your blessing, \nd Lord\nd*, to the godly,
\q2 and the shield of your [us:favor|cth:favour] protects them.

\s Psalm 6 – A Cry for Help in Time of Trouble
\rem Revision 2
\d For the leader; with instrumental music on the sheminith. A psalm of David.
\q
\v 1 Rebuke me not, \nd Lord\nd*, in your anger,
\q2 punish me not in your wrath.
\q
\v 2 \nd Lord\nd*, be gracious to me
\q2 in my weakness.
\q Heal me \nd Lord\nd*,
\q2 for racked is my body;
\q
\v 3 all of me utterly racked.
\q2 Why do you wait so long, \nd Lord\nd*?
\b
\q
\v 4 Turn, \nd Lord\nd*, rescue me;
\q2 save me, because of your love.
\q
\v 5 For in death none can call you to mind;
\q2 in Sheol who can praise you?
\b
\q
\v 6 I am so weary of sighing.
\q2 All the night I make my bed swim,
\q2 and wet my couch with my tears.
\q
\v 7 My eyes swollen with grief;
\q2 from weeping caused by my foes.
\b
\q
\v 8 Begone, workers of wrong,
\q2 for the \nd Lord\nd* has heard my loud weeping,
\q
\v 9 the \nd Lord\nd* has heard my entreaty,
\q2 the \nd Lord\nd* accepts my prayer.
\q
\v 10 My foes will be stricken with terror,
\q2 brought to shame and dismay in a moment.

\c 7
\s Psalm 7 – A Prayer to the God of Justice
\rem Revision 2
\d A Shiggaion of David, which he sang to the \nd Lord\nd* about Cush, the Benjamite.
\q
\v 1 \nd Lord\nd* my God, I take refuge in you.
\q Deliver me, save me from all who pursue me;
\q2
\v 2 or like lions they will tear me to pieces,
\q2 and rend me, past hope of rescue.
\b
\q
\v 3 \nd Lord\nd*, my God, if my life has been such
\q2 if my hands have been stained with guilt,
\q2
\v 4 if friends I paid back with evil,
\q2 if I plundered my foes without cause,
\q
\v 5 may the enemy chase [neut:and|masc:till he] find me,
\q2 [neut:|masc:may he] trample my life to the ground,
\q2 my [us:honor|cth:honour] leave in the dirt! \qs Selah\qs*
\b
\q
\v 6 Arise, \nd Lord\nd*, in anger,
\q2 against my foes rise in fury.
\q Awake for my help:
\q2 let justice be done.
\q
\v 7 Gather the nations about you,
\q2 and sit on your lofty throne,
\q2
\v 8 as the \nd Lord\nd*, the judge of the peoples.
\q Judge me, \nd Lord\nd*, in my innocence
\q2 and according to my integrity.
\b
\q
\v 9 Put an end to the wrong of the wicked,
\q2 protect the righteous.
\q Searcher of hearts and minds,
\q2 righteous God.
\q
\v 10 God is my shield:
\q2 he saves the upright in heart.
\b
\q
\v 11 God is a just judge,
\q2 constant in righteous anger.
\q
\v 12 He will sharpen his sword without fail,
\q2 his bow is bent and ready,
\q
\v 13 his deadly weapons are ready,
\q2 his arrows he makes of flame.
\b
\q
\v 14 The enemy who conceives evil;
\q2 pregnant with mischief,
\q2 giving birth to lies,
\q
\v 15 a pit [neut:they have|masc:he has] made and dug;
\q2 but into the hole that [neut:they|masc:he] made [neut:they|masc:he] will fall.
\q
\v 16 On [neut:their|masc:his] own [neut:heads|masc:head] [neut:their|masc:his] mischief comes back;
\q2 on [neut:their|masc:his] own [neut:skulls|masc:skull] [neut:their|masc:his] violence comes down.
\q
\v 17 I will give thanks to the \nd Lord\nd* for his justice,
\q2 and sing to the name of the \nd Lord\nd* Most High.

\s Psalm 8 – God's Glory in Nature
\rem Revision 2
\d For the leader: A psalm of David, to be accompanied by a stringed instrument.
\q
\v 1 \nd Lord\nd* our God!
\q2 How glorious in all the earth is your name!
\q Your praise reaches as high as the heavens,
\q2
\v 2 from the mouths of children and infants.
\b
\q You have built a fortress
\q2 against your enemies,
\q to silence the foe and the rebel.
\b
\q
\v 3 When I look at your heavens,
\q2 the work of your fingers,
\q the moon and the stars,
\q2 which you have set there,
\q
\v 4 what are mortals,
\q2 that you think of them,
\q humans,
\q2 that you visit them?
\b
\q
\v 5 Yet you made them little less than divine,
\q2 crowned them with glory and majesty,
\q
\v 6 made them lord of the works of your hands,
\q2 put all things under their feet –
\q
\v 7 sheep and oxen,
\q2 all of them;
\q and the wild beasts also:
\q2
\v 8 birds of the air,
\q2 and fish of the sea,
\q2 and all that crosses the paths of the ocean.
\b
\q
\v 9 \nd Lord\nd* our God!
\q2 How glorious in all the earth is your name!

\s Psalm 9 – A Song of Praise the Lord's Justice
\rem Revision 2
\d For the leader; 'almuth labben. A psalm of David.
\q
\v 1 With all my heart I will praise the \nd Lord\nd*,
\q2 all your wonders I will rehearse.
\q
\v 2 I will rejoice and exult in you,
\q2 singing praise to your name, Most High;
\q
\v 3 because backward my foes were turned,
\q2 they stumbled and perished before you.
\b
\q
\v 4 My right and my claim you have upheld,
\q2 you did sit on the throne as a fair judge,
\q
\v 5 rebuking the nations, destroying the wicked,
\q2 and blotting their name out forever and ever.
\q
\v 6 The foe is vanished, ruined forever,
\q2 their cities destroyed, their memory perished.
\b
\q
\v 7 See! The \nd Lord\nd* is seated forever
\q2 on the throne he established for judgment,
\q
\v 8 ruling the world with justice,
\q2 and judging the nations with equity.
\b
\q
\v 9 So the \nd Lord\nd* proves a haven to the oppressed,
\q2 a haven in times of trouble.
\q
\v 10 Well may they trust you who know your name,
\q2 for those who seek you, you never abandon.
\b
\q
\v 11 Sing praise to the \nd Lord\nd*, whose home is in Zion,
\q2 declare his deeds among the nations.
\q
\v 12 As avenger of blood, he keeps them in mind,
\q2 he does not forget the cry of the wretched.
\b
\q
\v 13 Show me [us:favor|cth:favour], \nd Lord\nd*,
\q2 see how my foes afflict me,
\q2 lift me up from the gates of death;
\q
\v 14 so I may, in your help exulting,
\q2 tell forth your praise at the gates of Zion.
\b
\q
\v 15 The nations are sunk in the pit which they made,
\q2 in the net that they hid, their own foot is entangled.
\q
\v 16 The \nd Lord\nd* is revealed in the judgment he wrought,
\q2 the wicked are snared in their own handiwork. \qs Selah\qs*
\b
\q
\v 17 Let the wicked depart to Sheol,
\q2 all the nations that live forgetful of God.
\q
\v 18 For the needy will not be always forgotten,
\q2 nor the hope of the helpless be lost forever.
\b
\q
\v 19 Arise, \nd Lord\nd*; don't let them triumph:
\q2 before your face let the nations be judged.
\q
\v 20 Strike them with fear, \nd Lord\nd*:
\q2 show the nations how frail they are. \qs Selah\qs*

\s Psalm 10 – A Prayer for Help
\rem Revision 2
\q
\v 1 Why do you stand, \nd Lord\nd*, so far away,
\q2 hiding yourself in times of trouble?
\q
\v 2 The wicked, in their pride, are pursuing the helpless:
\q2 let them be caught in the schemes they have plotted.
\b
\q
\v 3 For the wicked boasts of [neut:their|masc:his] wanton greed;
\q2 the robber despises the \nd Lord\nd*, and curses him,
\q
\v 4 in[neut:|masc: his] wicked pride, thinks:
\q2 God doesn't care,
\q2 God doesn't call to account.
\b
\q
\v 5 Never a season that [neut:they do|masc:he does] not prosper;
\q2 your judgments are far above out of [neut:their|masc:his] sight:
\q2 [neut:they scoff at their foes|masc:as for his foes, he scoffs at them all].
\b
\q
\v 6 [neut:Each|masc:He] says in [neut:their|masc:his] heart,
\q2 “I will never be shaken;
\q I will live for all time
\q2 untouched by misfortune.”
\q
\v 7 [neut:Their mouths are|masc:His mouth is] full of deceit and oppression:
\q2 under [neut:their tongues lurks|masc:his tongue lurk] mischief and wrong.
\b
\q
\v 8 Lying in secret in some village ambush,
\q2 and stealthily watching, [neut:they murder|masc:he murders] the innocent.
\q
\v 9 Like a lion [neut:that|masc:he] lurks in [neut:a|masc:his] secret lair
\q2 [neut:they lurk|masc:lurks] intending to catch the defenceless;
\q2 to seize them, to drag them away in [neut:their|masc:his] net.
\b
\q
\v 10 [neut:Their|masc:His] victims are crushed,
\q2 sink down to the ground.
\q Under [neut:their|masc:his] claws
\q2 the hapless fall.
\q
\v 11 [neut:The wicked say in their hearts|masc:He says in his heart]
\q2 that God has forgotten,
\q has hidden his face,
\q2 will see nothing.
\b
\q
\v 12 Arise, \nd Lord\nd*, lift up your hand,
\q2 do not forget the cry of the wretched.
\q
\v 13 Why do the wicked treat God with contempt,
\q2 and say in their hearts, “God doesn't care”?
\b
\q
\v 14 You have seen the trouble and sorrow;
\q2 you mark it all, and will take it in hand.
\q The hapless can count on you,
\q2 helper of orphans.
\b
\q
\v 15 Break the arm of the wicked and evil:
\q2 search out [neut:their|masc:his] sin, till no more be found.
\q
\v 16 The \nd Lord\nd* is king forever and ever:
\q2 the nations will vanish from his land.
\b
\q
\v 17 \nd Lord\nd*, you have heard the desire of the humble,
\q2 inclining your ear, strengthening their hearts,
\q
\v 18 rights you have won for the crushed and the orphan,
\q2 so no one on earth may strike terror again.

\s Psalm 11 – Trust in the Lord
\rem Revision 2
\d For the leader. Of David.
\q
\v 1 In the \nd Lord\nd* I take refuge.
\q2 How can you tell me
\q to flee like a bird to the mountains?
\b
\q
\v 2 “See! The wicked are bending the bow,
\q2 their arrow is set on the string,
\q2 to shoot from the shadows at the upright in heart.
\q
\v 3 In this tearing down of foundations
\q2 what good can [neut:a good person|masc:the just man] do?”
\b
\q
\v 4 The \nd Lord\nd* in his holy temple,
\q2 the \nd Lord\nd* in heaven, enthroned.
\q His eyes watch the world,
\q2 they see everyone.
\q
\v 5 The \nd Lord\nd* examines the righteous and wicked,
\q2 and the lover of violence he hates.
\q
\v 6 On the wicked he rains coals of fire and brimstone,
\q2 and their drink will be scorching wind.
\q
\v 7 For the \nd Lord\nd* is just, and justice he loves;
\q2 so the upright will see his face.

\s Psalm 12 – A Prayer for the Faithful in a False World
\rem Revision 2
\d For the leader; on the sheminith. A psalm of David.
\q
\v 1 Help, \nd Lord\nd*, for the good are all gone,
\q2 faithful people have vanished.
\q
\v 2 One lies to another, speaking empty lies,
\q2 with flattering lips and false hearts they speak.
\b
\q
\v 3 May the \nd Lord\nd* cut off all the flattering lips,
\q2 and the tongue that utters arrogance,
\q
\v 4 they declare, “Our tongue is our strength,
\q2 our allies our lips: who is lord over us?”
\b
\q
\v 5 “The poor are despoiled, and the needy are sighing;
\q2 so now I will act,” the \nd Lord\nd* declares
\q2 “And place them in the safety they long for.”
\b
\q
\v 6 The words of the \nd Lord\nd* are words that are pure,
\q2 silver smelted, seven times refined.
\q
\v 7 You will keep us, \nd Lord\nd*,
\q2 and guard us from this generation forever,
\q
\v 8 in a world where the wicked prowl,
\q2 and worthless people exalted.

\v 1 How long, \nd Lord\nd*, will you forget me forever?
\q2 How long will you hide your face from me?
\q
\v 2 How long must I nurse grief inside me,
\q2 and in my heart a daily sorrow?
\q2 How long are my foes to exult over me?
\b
\q
\v 3 Look at me, answer me, \nd Lord\nd* my God.
\q Fill my eyes with your light,
\q2 lest I sleep in death,
\q2
\v 4 lest my enemies claim to have triumphed,
\q2 lest my foes rejoice at my downfall.
\b
\q
\v 5 But I trust in your kindness:
\q2 my heart will rejoice in your help.
\q2
\v 6 I will sing to the \nd Lord\nd* who was good to me.

\s Psalm 14 – The Folly of Denying God
\rem Revision 2
\d For the leader. Of David.
\q
\v 1 Fools say in their heart,
\q2 “There is no God.”
\q Vile, hateful their life is;
\q2 not one does good.
\b
\q
\v 2 From heaven the \nd Lord\nd* looks out
\q2 on humans, to see
\q if any are wise,
\q2 and care for God.
\b
\q
\v 3 But all have turned bad,
\q2 the taint is on all;
\q not one does good,
\q2 no, not one.
\b
\q
\v 4 Have they learned their lesson,
\q2 those workers of evil?
\q Who ate up my people,
\q2 eating, devouring,
\q2 never calling to the \nd Lord\nd*.
\b
\q
\v 5 Sore afraid will they be;
\q2 for God is among
\q2 those who are righteous,
\q
\v 6 you may mock the plans of the poor,
\q2 but the \nd Lord\nd* is their refuge.
\b
\q
\v 7 If only help from Zion
\q2 would come for Israel!
\q When the \nd Lord\nd* brings his people
\q2 a change of fortune,
\q how glad will be Jacob,
\q2 and Israel how joyful!

\q
\v 2 [neut:The person|masc:He] whose walk is blameless,
\q2 whose conduct is right,
\q whose words are true and sincere;
\q2
\v 3 on whose tongue there sits no slander,
\q who will not harm [neut:a|masc:his] friend,
\q2
\v 4 nor cruelly insult [neut:a|masc:his] [us:neighbor|cth:neighbour],

\q [neut:who|masc:he] keeps [neut:an|masc:his] oath, whatever the cost,
\q2
\v 5 [neut:whose money is lent|masc:his money he lends] without interest,

\b
\q [neut:The person|masc:He] who does these things will always stand firm.

\s Psalm 16 – The Joy of Fellowship with God
\rem Revision 2
\d A michtam of David.
\q
\v 1 Keep me, O God, for in you I take refuge.
\q2
\v 2 I said to the \nd Lord\nd*, “You are my \nd Lord\nd*,
\q my happiness rests in you alone.
\q
\v 3 Those who are holy in the land,
\q2 they, they alone, are the noble ones;
\q2 all my delight is in them.”
\b
\q
\v 4 Those who choose other gods
\q2 find endless sorrow.
\q In their offerings of blood I will have no part
\q2 nor take their name on my lips.
\q
\v 5 The \nd Lord\nd* is my share and my portion,
\q2 my fate is in your strong hands.
\b
\q
\v 6 The boundary lines of my life
\q2 mark out delightful country,
\q2 my heritage pleases me well.
\q
\v 7 I praise the \nd Lord\nd* for his counsel,
\q2 which so stirs my heart in the night.
\q
\v 8 I keep the \nd Lord\nd* always in mind:
\q2 with him at my hand, I can never be moved.
\b
\q
\v 9 So my heart is glad, there is joy inside me;
\q2 and in safety of body I live.
\q
\v 10 For you will not give me up to Sheol
\q2 nor let any who love you see the pit.
\q
\v 11 You will show me the path that leads to life,

\s Psalm 17 – A Prayer for Deliverance
\rem Revision 2
\d A prayer of David.
\q
\v 1 Listen, O \nd Lord\nd*, to my innocence;
\q2 attend to my piercing cry.
\q Give heed to my prayer
\q2 out of lips unfeigned.
\q
\v 2 Let my vindication come from you,
\q2 your eyes see the truth.
\b
\q
\v 3 When you test my heart when you visit at night,
\q2 and assay me like silver – you can find no evil.
\q I am determined that my mouth should not lie.
\q2
\v 4 I gave earnest heed to the words of your lips.
\q
\v 5 My steps have held fast to the paths of your precepts
\q2 and in your tracks have my feet never stumbled.
\b
\q
\v 6 So I call you, O God, with assurance of answer;
\q2 bend down your ear to me, hear what I say.
\q
\v 7 Show your [us:marvelous|cth:marvellous] love, you who save from enemies
\q2 those who take refuge at your right hand.
\b
\q
\v 8 Keep me as the apple of the eye,
\q2 hide me in the shelter of your wings.
\q
\v 9 From wicked [neut:people|masc:men] who do me violence,
\q2 from deadly foes who crowd around me.
\b
\q
\v 10 They have closed their hearts to pity,
\q2 the words of their mouths are haughty.
\q
\v 11 Now they dog us at every step,
\q2 keenly watching, to hurl us to the ground,
\q
\v 12 like a lion, longing to tear,
\q2 like a young lion, lurking in secret.
\b
\q
\v 13 Arise, \nd Lord\nd*, face [neut:them|masc:him] and fell [neut:them|masc:him].
\q2 By your sword set me free from the wicked,
\q
\v 14 by your hand, O \nd Lord\nd*, from [neut:those|masc:the men] –
\q2 whose portion of life is but of this world.
\q But let your treasured ones have food in plenty
\q may their children be full and their children satisfied.
\b
\q2
\v 15 In my innocence I will see your face,
\q awake I am filled with a vision of you.

\s Psalm 18 – A King's Song of Gratitude
\rem Revision 2
\d For the leader. Of David, the servant of the \nd Lord\nd*, who recited the words of this song to the \nd Lord\nd* after the \nd Lord\nd* had saved him from the power of all his enemies and from the hand of Saul. He said:
\q
\v 1 I love you, O \nd Lord\nd*, my strength.
\q
\v 2 The \nd Lord\nd* is my rock, my fortress, deliverer,
\q2 my God, my rock, where I take refuge,
\q2 my shield, my defender, my tower.
\q
\v 3 Worthy of praise is the \nd Lord\nd* whom I call on,
\q2 he rescues me from all my foes.
\b
\q
\v 4 The waves of death broke about me,
\q2 fearful floods of chaos.
\q
\v 5 Sheol threw cords around me,
\q2 snares of death came to meet me.
\q
\v 6 In distress I cried to the \nd Lord\nd*,
\q2 and shouted for help to my God;
\q in his temple he heard my voice,
\q2 into his ears came my cry.
\b
\q
\v 7 Then the earth shook and quaked,
\q2 mountains trembled to their foundations,
\q2 and quaked because of his wrath.
\q
\v 8 Smoke went up from his nostrils,
\q2 devouring fire from his mouth,
\q2 coals were kindled by it.
\b
\q
\v 9 Then he bent the sky and came down,
\q2 thick darkness was under his feet.
\q
\v 10 He rode on a cherub and flew,
\q2 darting on wings of wind,
\q
\v 11 with his screen of darkness about him,
\q2 in thick dark clouds of water.
\b
\q
\v 12 At the radiance before him there passed
\q2 hailstones and coals of fire.
\q
\v 13 The \nd Lord\nd* thundered from heaven,
\q2 the Most High uttered his voice.
\q
\v 14 He shot his arrows and scattered them,
\q2 flashed lightnings, and routed them.
\q
\v 15 The channels of the sea were revealed,
\q2 the world was laid bare to its base,
\q at your rebuke, O \nd Lord\nd*,
\q2 at the blast of the breath of your nostrils.
\b
\q
\v 16 He stretched from on high, he seized me,
\q2 drew me up from the mighty waters,
\q
\v 17 and saved me from those who hated me –
\q2 fierce foes, too mighty for me.
\q
\v 18 In my day of distress they assailed me,
\q2 but the \nd Lord\nd* proved my support.
\q
\v 19 To a spacious place he brought me,
\q2 and, for love of me, he saved me.
\b
\q
\v 20 The \nd Lord\nd* repays my innocence,
\q2 he rewards my cleanness of hands.
\q
\v 21 For I kept the ways of the \nd Lord\nd*,
\q2 nor have wickedly strayed from my God.
\q
\v 22 His commandments were all before me,
\q2 his statutes I put not away.
\q
\v 23 And I was blameless before him,
\q2 guarding myself from sin.
\q
\v 24 So the \nd Lord\nd* repaid my innocence,
\q2 my cleanness of hands in his sight.
\b
\q
\v 25 With the loyal you are loyal,
\q2 and with the blameless blameless.
\q
\v 26 With the pure you show yourself pure,
\q2 but shrewd with the devious.
\q
\v 27 For the lowly people you save,
\q2 but haughty eyes you abase.
\q
\v 28 You are my lamp, \nd Lord\nd*,
\q2 my God who enlightens my darkness.
\q
\v 29 With you I can storm a rampart,
\q2 with my God I can leap a wall.
\q
\v 30 As for God, his way is perfect;
\q2 the word of the \nd Lord\nd* is pure.
\q2 He is shield to all who take refuge in him.
\b
\q
\v 31 For who is God but the \nd Lord\nd*?
\q2 And who is a rock but our God?
\q
\v 32 The God who arms me with strength,
\q2 who cleared and smoothed my way.
\q
\v 33 He made my feet like hinds' feet,
\q2 and set me up on the heights.
\q
\v 34 He taught my hands how to fight,
\q2 and my arms how to bend a bronze bow.
\b
\q
\v 35 The shield of your help you gave me,
\q2 your right hand supports me,
\q2 you stoop down to make me great.
\q
\v 36 In your strength I took giant strides,
\q2 and my feet never slipped.
\q
\v 37 So I chased the foe till I caught them,
\q2 and turned not, till I made an end of them.
\q
\v 38 I smashed them, they could not rise,
\q2 they fell beneath my feet.
\b
\q
\v 39 You did arm me with strength for war,
\q2 you did bow my assailants beneath me.
\q
\v 40 You made my foes turn their back to me,
\q2 and those who did hate me I finished.
\q
\v 41 They cried for help, but none saved them;
\q2 to the \nd Lord\nd*, but he answered them not.
\q
\v 42 I beat them like dust of the market-place,
\q2 stamped them like mud of the streets.
\b
\q
\v 43 From the strife of the peoples you saved me,
\q2 you made me head of the nations,
\q2 peoples I knew not did serve me.
\q
\v 44 On the instant they hear, they obey me,
\q2 foreigners come to me cringing.
\q
\v 45 Foreigners lose courage,
\q2 and come out of their strongholds trembling.
\b
\q
\v 46 The \nd Lord\nd* is alive! Blest be my rock!
\q2 Exalted be God, my protector!
\q
\v 47 The God who gave me revenge,
\q2 and brought down nations beneath me,
\q
\v 48 who saved me from angry foes,
\q2 and set me above my assailants,
\q2 safe from the violent[neut:|masc: man].
\b
\q
\v 49 For this I will praise you among the nations,
\q2 making music, O \nd Lord\nd*, to your name:
\q
\v 50 for great triumphs he grants to his king,
\q2 and faithful love he shows his anointed,
\q2 to David and his seed evermore.

\rem Revision 2
\d For the leader. A psalm of David.
\q
\v 1 The heavens declare God's glory,
\q2 the sky tells what his hands have done.
\q
\v 2 Day tells it to day,
\q2 night reveals it to night,
\q
\v 3 without speaking, without words;
\q2 without the sound of voices.
\q
\v 4 But through all the world their voice carries
\q2 their words to the ends of the earth.
\b
\q He has pitched a tent for the sun in the sky,
\q2
\v 5 it comes out like a bridegroom from his bridal chamber,
\q it joyfully runs its course like a hero.
\q2
\v 6 From one end of the heavens it rises,
\q and [us:around|cth:round] it runs to the other,
\q2 and nothing hides from its heat.
\s In Praise of the Law
\q
\v 7 The law of the \nd Lord\nd* is perfect,
\q2 renewing life.
\q The decrees of the \nd Lord\nd* are trusty,
\q2 making the simple wise.
\b
\q
\v 8 The behests of the \nd Lord\nd* are right,
\q2 rejoicing the heart.
\q The command of the \nd Lord\nd* is pure,
\q2 giving light to the eyes.
\b
\q
\v 9 The fear of the \nd Lord\nd* is clean,
\q2 it endures forever.
\q The \nd Lord\nd*'s judgments are true
\q2 and right altogether.
\b
\q
\v 10 More precious are they than gold –
\q2 than fine gold in plenty,
\q and sweeter they are than honey,
\q2 that drops from the comb.
\b
\q
\v 11 By them is your servant warned;
\q2 who keeps them has rich reward.
\q
\v 12 Who can know their flaws?
\q2 Absolve me from those I know not.
\b
\q
\v 13 Keep your servant from wilful sins –
\q2 from falling under their sway:
\q then blameless and clear will I be
\q2 from great [us:offense|cth:offence].
\b
\q
\v 14 May the words of my mouth and the thoughts of my heart
\q2 be pleasing to you, \nd Lord\nd*,

\v 2 I cry in the day, you do not answer,
\q I cry in the night but find no rest.
\b
\q
\v 3 You are the Holy One,
\q2 throned on the praises of Israel.
\q
\v 4 In you [neut:our ancestors trusted|masc:did our fathers trust],
\q2 they trusted and you delivered them.

\b
\q
\v 6 But I am a worm, [neut:not a person|masc:and no man];

\q
\v 8 “He relies on the \nd Lord\nd*; let him save him.
\q2 Let him rescue the one he holds dear!”
\b
\q
\v 9 But you drew me from the womb,
\q2 laid me safely on my mother's breasts.
\q
\v 10 On your care was I cast from my very birth,
\q2 you are my God from my mother's womb.
\q
\v 11 Be not far from me, for trouble is nigh,

\q My heart is become like wax,

\b
\q
\v 15 My palate is dry as a sherd,

\q2 in the dust of death you lay me.
\q
\v 16 For dogs are round about me,
\q2 a band of knaves encircles me,
\q2 gnawing my hands and my feet.
\q
\v 17 I can count my bones, every one.
\q2 As for them, they feast their eyes on me.

\q2 and inquire in his temple.
\b
\q
\v 5 For he will hide me in his shelter
\q2 in the day of misfortune.
\q In his sheltering tent he hides me:
\q2 he lifts me up on a rock.
\b
\q
\v 6 And now that my head he has lifted
\q above my encircling foes,
\q I will march round the altar and sacrifice,
\q2 shouting with joy, in his tent,

\s The Serenity of Faith
\q
\v 7 Hear, O \nd Lord\nd*, my loud cry,

\v 8 My heart has said to you,
\q2 “Your face, O \nd Lord\nd*, I seek.”
\b
\q
\v 9 Hide not your face from me,
\q2 reject not your servant in anger:
\q2 for you have been my help.
\q Abandon me not, nor forsake me,
\q2 O God of my help:
\q
\v 10 for father and mother have left me;
\q2 but the \nd Lord\nd* will take me up.
\b
\q
\v 11 Teach me your way, O \nd Lord\nd*:
\q2 lead me in an even path,
\q2 because of my enemies.
\q
\v 12 Give me not up, O \nd Lord\nd*,
\q2 unto the rage of my foes;
\q for against me have risen false witnesses,
\q2 breathing out cruelty.
\b
\q
\v 13 Firm is the faith I cherish,
\q2 that I, in the land of the living,
\q2 will yet see the goodness of God.
\q

\s Psalm 28 – An Answered Prayer for Help
\d Of David.
\q
\v 1 Unto you, O \nd Lord\nd*, do I cry;

\q lest, through holding your peace, I become
\q2 like those who go down to the pit.
\q
\v 2 Hear my loud entreaty,
\q2 as I cry for help to you,
\q lifting my hands, O \nd Lord\nd*,
\q2 towards your holy chancel.
\b
\q
\v 3 Take me not off with the wicked,
\q2 nor with the workers of wrong,
\q whose speech to their [us:neighbors|cth:neighbours] is friendly,
\q2 while evil is in their heart.
\q
\v 4 Give them as they have done,
\q2 as their wicked deeds deserve.
\q As their hands have wrought, so give to them:
\q2 requite to them their deserts.
\q
\v 5 They are blind to all that the \nd Lord\nd* does,
\q2 to all that his hands have wrought;
\q and so he will tear them down,
\q2 to build them up no more.
\b
\q
\v 6 Blest be the \nd Lord\nd*, who has heard
\q2 my voice as I plead for mercy.
\q
\v 7 The \nd Lord\nd* is my strength and my shield;

\q I was helped: so my heart is exultant,
\q2 and in my song I will praise him.
\b

\v 8 The \nd Lord\nd* is the strength of his people,

\v 1 I will extol you, O \nd Lord\nd*,

\q and not suffered my foes to rejoice over me.
\b
\q
\v 2 I cried to you for help,
\q2 O \nd Lord\nd* my God, and you healed me.
\q
\v 3 You have brought me up, \nd Lord\nd*, from Sheol,
\q2 from my way to the pit back to life you have called me.
\b
\q
\v 4 Sing praise to the \nd Lord\nd*, faithful people;
\q2 give thanks to his holy name.
\q
\v 5 For his anger lasts only a moment,
\q2 his [us:favor|cth:favour] endures for a lifetime.
\q Weeping may lodge for the night,
\q2 but the morning brings shouts of joy.
\b
\q
\v 6 When all went well, I imagined
\q2 that never should I be shaken.
\q
\v 7 For by your [us:favor|cth:favour], O \nd Lord\nd*,
\q2 you had set me on mountains strong:
\q but you hide your face,
\q2 and I was confounded.
\b
\q
\v 8 Then to you, \nd Lord\nd*, I cried,
\q2 to the \nd Lord\nd* I begged for mercy,
\q
\v 9 “What profit is there in my blood,
\q2 if I go down to the pit?
\q Can you be praised by dust?
\q2 Can it tell of your faithfulness?
\q
\v 10 Hear, \nd Lord\nd*, and show me your [us:favor|cth:favour],
\q2 \nd Lord\nd* be a helper to me.”
\b
\q
\v 11 You have turned my mourning to dancing;
\q2 my sackcloth you have unloosed,
\q2 and clothed me with joy:
\q
\v 12 that unceasingly I should sing your praise,
\q2 and give thanks to you, \nd Lord\nd* my God, forever.

\q Rescue me in your faithfulness;
\q2
\v 2 incline to me your ear.
\q Deliver me speedily.
\q2 Be to me a rock of defence,
\q a fortified house, to save me.
\q2
\v 3 For my rock and my fortress are you;
\q lead me and guide me so your name will be [us:honored|cth:honoured].
\q2
\v 4 Draw me out of the net they have hid for me,
\q for you yourself are my refuge.
\q2
\v 5 Into your hand I commend my spirit:

\q
\v 6 I hate those devoted to worthless idols;
\q2 I trust in the \nd Lord\nd*.
\q
\v 7 I will rejoice and be glad in your love,
\q2 because you have looked on my misery,

\q
\v 8 You have not given me into the enemy's hand,
\q2 you have set my feet in a spacious place.
\b
\q
\v 9 Be gracious to me, \nd Lord\nd*, for I am distressed;
\q2 my eye is wasted away with sorrow.
\q
\v 10 For my life is consumed with grief,
\q2 and my years with sighing.
\q My strength is broken with misery,
\q2 my bones waste away.
\q

\q At the sight of me in the street
\q2 [neut:people|masc:men] turn quickly away.

\q
\v 20 In your sheltering wings you hide them

\b
\q
\v 21 Blest be the \nd Lord\nd*
\q2 for the wonderful love he has shown me
\q2 in time of distress.

\q
\v 2 Happy [neut:are those|masc:the man], free from falseness of spirit,
\q2 to whom the \nd Lord\nd* reckons no debt of guilt.
\b
\q
\v 3 When I held my peace, my bones wore away
\q2 with my endless groaning;
\q
\v 4 for day and night did your hand
\q2 lie heavy upon me.
\q The sap of my life was dried up
\q2 as with fierce summer-heat. \qs Selah\qs*
\b
\q
\v 5 I began to acknowledge my sin,
\q2 not concealing my guilt;
\q and the moment I vowed to confess
\q2 to the \nd Lord\nd* my transgression,
\q then you yourself did pardon
\q2 the guilt of my sin. \qs Selah\qs*
\b
\q
\v 6 For this cause let all who are faithful
\q2 pray to you in the time of distress;
\q then, when the great waters rush,
\q2 they will not reach to him.

\v 14 The wicked have drawn the sword, and bent the bow,
\q2 to fell the poor, to slay [neut:those|masc:men] who walk uprightly;
\q
\v 15 but their sword will pierce their own heart,
\q2 and their bows will be broken in pieces.
\b
\q
\v 16 Better is the righteous [neut:person's|masc:man's] little
\q2 than the wealth of many wicked.
\q
\v 17 For the arms of the wicked will be broken,
\q2 but the \nd Lord\nd* upholds the righteous.
\b
\q
\v 18 The \nd Lord\nd* watches over the days of the blameless,
\q2 their heritage will continue forever.
\q
\v 19 They will not be shamed in the evil time,
\q2 in the days of famine they will be satisfied.
\b
\q
\v 20 Because the wicked will perish:
\q but the foes of the \nd Lord\nd*, like a brand in the oven,
\q2 will vanish, like smoke they will vanish.
\b
\q
\v 21 The wicked must borrow and cannot pay back,
\q2 but the righteous is lavish and gives.
\q
\v 22 For those blest by the \nd Lord\nd* inherit the land,
\q2 while those whom he curses will be cut off.
\b
\q
\v 23 The \nd Lord\nd* supports the steps
\q2 of [neut:those|masc:the man] with whom he is pleased.
\q
\v 24 Though [neut:they|masc:he] fall, [neut:they|masc:he] will not be cast headlong,
\q2 for the \nd Lord\nd* holds [neut:their hands|masc:his hand].
\b
\q
\v 25 Never, from youth to age,
\q2 have I seen the righteous forsaken,
\q2 or [neut:their|masc:his] children begging bread.
\q
\v 26 [neut:They are|masc:He is] ever lavishly lending,
\q2 and [neut:their|masc:his] children are fountains of blessing.
\b
\q
\v 27 Turn away from evil and do good
\q2 and you will live in the land forever.
\q
\v 28 For the \nd Lord\nd* loves justice,
\q2 he does not forsake his friends.
\b
\q The unrighteous will be destroyed forever,
\q2 and the seed of the wicked will be cut off.
\q
\v 29 But the land will belong to the righteous,
\q2 they will live upon it forever,
\b
\q
\v 30 The mouth of the righteous murmurs wisdom,
\q2 and words of justice are on [neut:their tongues|masc:his tongue].
\q
\v 31 The law of [neut:their|masc:his] God is in [neut:their|masc:his] heart,
\q2 [neut:their|masc:his] steps are never unsteady.
\b
\q
\v 32 The wicked watches the righteous,
\q2 and seeks to put [neut:them|masc:him] to death.
\q
\v 33 But the \nd Lord\nd* leaves [neut:them|masc:him] not in [neut:their|masc:his] hand:
\q2 at [neut:their|masc:his] trial [neut:they|masc:he] will not be held guilty.
\b
\q
\v 34 Wait on the \nd Lord\nd*, and observe his way:
\q2 he will lift you to [us:honor|cth:honour] the land will be yours,
\q2 you will feast your eyes on the doom of the wicked.
\b
\q
\v 35 I have seen the wicked exultant,
\q2 lifting [neut:themselves|masc:himself] like a cedar of Lebanon.
\q
\v 36 But the moment I passed, [neut:they|masc:he had] vanished!
\q2 I sought for [neut:them|masc:him], but [neut:they|masc:he] could not be found.
\b
\q
\v 37 Preserve your [us:honor|cth:honour] and practise uprightness,
\q2 for such a [neut:person|masc:man] fares well in the end.
\q
\v 38 But transgressors will perish together.
\q2 Cut off are the wicked forever.
\b
\q
\v 39 The righteous are saved by the \nd Lord\nd*,
\q2 who in time of distress is their refuge:
\q
\v 40 the \nd Lord\nd* helps and rescue them,

\d A Psalm of David. A lament.
\q
\v 1 Reprove me not, \nd Lord\nd*, in your anger,
\q2 and chasten me not in your wrath;
\q
\v 2 for your arrows have sunk into me,
\q2 and your hand lies heavy upon me.
\b
\q
\v 3 In my flesh is no soundness
\q2 because of your anger,
\q no health in my bones,
\q2 because of my sin.
\q
\v 4 For that my guilt
\q2 is gone over my head:
\q it weighs like a burden
\q2 too heavy for me.
\b
\q
\v 5 My wounds stink and fester,
\q2 for my foolishness I am tormented.
\q
\v 6 Bent and bowed am I utterly,
\q2 all the day going in mourning.
\b
\q
\v 7 My loins are filled with burning,
\q2 and in my flesh is no soundness.
\q
\v 8 I am utterly crushed and numb;
\q2 I cry louder than lion roars.
\b
\q
\v 9 \nd Lord\nd*, you know all that I long for,
\q2 my groans are not hidden from you.
\q
\v 10 My heart is throbbing,
\q2 my strength has failed me.
\q The light of my eyes –
\q2 even it is gone from me.
\b
\q
\v 11 My dear ones and friends keep aloof,
\q2 and my [us:neighbors|cth:neighbours] stand afar off.
\q
\v 12 They who aim at my life lay their snares,
\q2 they who seek my hurt speak of ruin,
\q2 nursing treachery all the day long.
\b
\q
\v 13 But I turn a deaf ear and hear not;
\q2 like the dumb I open not my mouth.
\q
\v 14 I am [neut:like one|masc:as a man] without hearing,
\q2 with no arguments in [neut:my|masc:his] mouth.
\b
\q
\v 15 For my hope, O \nd Lord\nd*, is in you.
\q2 You will answer, O \nd Lord\nd* my God,
\q
\v 16 when I utter the hope that those
\q2 who made scorn of my tottering feet
\q2 may not rejoice over me.
\b
\q
\v 17 For I am ready to fall,
\q2 my pain forsakes me never.
\q
\v 18 I acknowledge my guilt,
\q2 I am anxious because of my sin:
\b
\q
\v 19 My wanton assailants are strong,
\q2 those who wrongfully hate me are many,
\q
\v 20 who render me evil for good,
\q2 and oppose me, because I make good my goal.
\b
\q
\v 21 Do not forsake me, O \nd Lord\nd*;
\q2 my God, be not far from me.

\s Psalm 39 – The Pathos of Life
\d For the leader; for Jeduthun. A psalm of David.
\q
\v 1 I vowed to watch my words,
\q2 and sin not with my tongue,
\q but to put on my mouth a muzzle,
\q2 while the wicked were in my presence.
\q
\v 2 I was silent and dumb,
\q2 speechless:
\q2 but my pain was stirred up.
\q
\v 3 My heart grew hot within me;
\q2 as I mused, the fire was kindled,
\q2 till at last the words came to my tongue.
\b
\q
\v 4 “Teach me, O \nd Lord\nd*, my end,
\q2 and the sum of my days what it is.
\q2 Let me know how transient I am.
\q
\v 5 See! My days you have made but a span,
\q2 and my life is as nothing before you.
\q It is but as a breath that [neut:everyone|masc:every man] stands: \qs Selah\qs*
\q2
\v 6 it is but in mere semblance [neut:we walk|masc:man walks] to and fro,
\q and all [neut:our|masc:his] noise is for nothing.
\q2 [neut:We heap|masc:He heaps] up, and [neut:know|masc:knows] not who will gather.”
\b
\q
\v 7 And now, what wait I for, \nd Lord\nd*?
\q2 My hope is in you.
\q
\v 8 From all my transgressions deliver me;
\q2 make me not the scorn of the fool.
\q
\v 9 I am dumb, never opening my mouth,
\q2 for this is your own doing.
\q
\v 10 Remove your stroke from off me:
\q2 by the might of your hand I am spent.
\q
\v 11 When you rebuke [neut:someone|masc:a man] to punish [neut:their|masc:his] sins,
\q2 you consume, like a moth, what [neut:they|masc:he] treasures.
\q2 [neut:Everyone|masc:Every man] is only a breath. \qs Selah\qs*
\b
\q
\v 12 Hear my prayer, O \nd Lord\nd*;
\q2 attend to my cry for help.
\q2 Hold not your peace at my tears.
\q For I am but a guest of yours,
\q2 a stranger visiting, like all my [neut:ancestors|masc:fathers].
\q
\v 13 Look away from me, let me smile again,
\q2 before I die and am gone.

\q
\v 1 For the \nd Lord\nd* I waited and waited,
\q2 till, inclining to me,
\q2 he heard my cry.
\q
\v 2 From the horrible pit he drew me,
\q2 up out of the miry clay;
\q he set my feet on a rock,
\q2 and my steps he made firm.
\q
\v 3 He put a new song in my mouth,
\q2 of praise to our God.
\q Many see it, and, filled with awe,
\q2 put their trust in the \nd Lord\nd*.
\b
\q
\v 4 Happy the [neut:person|masc:man] who has put
\q2 in the \nd Lord\nd* [neut:their|masc:his] trust,
\q not looking to false gods
\q2 or turning to idols.
\q
\v 5 With us you have wrought in rich measure,
\q2 O \nd Lord\nd* our God,
\q your marvels and purposes for us –
\q2 none may compare with you –
\q were I to declare or to tell them,
\q2 past counting are they.
\b
\q
\v 6 In offerings bloody or bloodless
\q2 you have no delight,
\q but with open ears you have made me.
\q Burnt-offering and offering for sin
\q2 are not what you ask.
\q
\v 7 Then said I, “Here I am,
\q2 as the roll of the book has enjoined.
\q
\v 8 My delight, O God, is to do your will,
\q2 and your law is within my heart.”
\q
\v 9 Well, O \nd Lord\nd*, you know
\q2 that, with lips unrestrained,
\q your righteousness I told
\q2 in the great congregation,
\q
\v 10 not hiding it in my heart.
\q2 I have told of your steadfast help,
\q from the great congregation I hid not
\q2 your love and your faithfulness.
\q
\v 11 So do not restrain, \nd Lord\nd*,
\q2 your pity from us.
\q Your love and your faithfulness – ever
\q2 may they be our shield.
\b
\q
\v 12 For evils that cannot be numbered
\q2 have compassed me round.
\q My transgressions have followed me up –
\q2 I can bear it no more.
\q They are more than the hairs of my head,
\q2 and my heart has forsaken me.
\q
\v 13 O \nd Lord\nd*, be pleased to deliver me,
\q2 haste to my help, O \nd Lord\nd*.
\q
\v 14 May those who are seeking my life
\q2 be ashamed and confounded together;
\q may those who delight in my hurt
\q2 be defeated and brought to [us:dishonor|cth:dishonour].
\q
\v 15 May those who hurrah over me
\q2 be dumbfounded because of their shame.
\q
\v 16 But may all who seek after you
\q2 rejoice and be glad in you.
\q May all those eager for your aid,
\q2 say, “Great is the \nd Lord\nd*” evermore.

\q

\v 5 My enemies speak of me nothing but evil,
\q2 “When will he die, and his name pass away?”
\q
\v 6 When one comes to see me, [neut:their|masc:his] words ring hollow;
\q2 [neut:their|masc:his] heart keeps gathering mischief the while;
\q2 and when [neut:they go|masc:he goes] out, [neut:they give|masc:he gives] it speech.

\q
\v 11 By this will I know you delight in me:

\q
\v 1 Like the hart which longs
\q2 for brooks of water,
\q I long
\q2 for you, God.
\b
\q
\v 2 I thirst for God,
\q2 for my living God.
\q When shall I enter in,
\q2 and see the face of God?
\q
\v 3 My tears have been my food
\q2 by day and by night;
\q for they say to me all the day long,
\q2 “Where is your God?”
\b
\q
\v 4 My heart floods with sorrow,
\q2 as I call to mind:
\q how I used to pass on with the throng,
\q2 at their head, to the house of God,
\q with glad shouts and giving of thanks,
\q2 in the throng who kept festival.
\b
\q
\v 5 Why am I downcast?
\q2 Why this moaning within me?
\q Hope in God;
\q2 for yet will I praise him,
\q2 my help, my God.
\b
\q
\v 6 I am sunk in my misery;
\q2 I will therefore call you to mind
\q from the land of Jordan and Hermon,
\q2 the mountain Mizar.
\q
\v 7 Flood is calling to flood

\q all your waves and your breakers

\b
\q
\v 8 In the day I cry to the \nd Lord\nd*
\q2 to summon his kindness;
\q and the song that I sing in the night
\q2 is a prayer to the living God.
\q
\v 9 I say to God my rock,
\q2 “Why have you forgotten me?
\q Why must I walk so sadly,
\q2 so hard pressed by the foe?”
\q
\v 10 It pierces me to the heart
\q2 to hear the enemy's taunts,
\q as all the day long they say to me,

\d For the leader. Of the Korahites. A maskil.
\q
\v 1 O God, we have heard with our ears,
\q2 all our [neut:ancestors|masc:fathers] have told us
\q of the work that you wrought in their day,
\q2 your wonders in days of old,
\q
\v 2 uprooting and crushing the nations,
\q2 then planting and settling them.
\q For it wasn't their own sword that won them the land,
\q2
\v 3 it was not their own arm that brought them the victory.
\q Yours was the hand and the arm,
\q2 yours was the face that shone on them with [us:favor|cth:favour].
\q
\v 4 It was you, my king and my God,
\q2 that ordained the victories of Jacob.
\b
\q
\v 5 Through you we can thrust back our foes,
\q2 and by your name tread down our assailants:
\q
\v 6 for not in my bow do I trust,
\q2 nor can my sword win me the victory.
\q
\v 7 Our victory comes from you,
\q2 and confusion to those who hate us.
\q
\v 8 In God we boast all the day long,
\q2 and your name will we praise forever. \qs Selah\qs*
\b
\q
\v 9 Yet you have spurned and disgraced us,
\q2 in not going forth with our armies,
\q
\v 10 and in making us flee from the foe,
\q2 so that those who hated us plundered us.
\q
\v 11 You have let us be eaten like sheep,
\q2 you have scattered us over the world,
\q
\v 12 sold your people for a pittance,
\q2 and getting no gain from their price.
\q
\v 13 You have made us the butt of our [us:neighbors|cth:neighbours],
\q2 the derision and scorn of all round us.
\q
\v 14 O'er the world you have made us a byword,
\q2 the nations at us shake their heads.
\q
\v 15 My disgrace is forever before me,
\q2 my face is covered with shame,
\q
\v 16 at the words of blasphemer and scoffer,
\q2 at the sight of the foe and the vengeful.
\b
\q
\v 17 All this has come upon us,
\q2 yet we have not forgotten you
\q2 nor falsely dealt with your covenant.
\q
\v 18 Our heart has not turned back,
\q2 nor our steps declined from your way,
\q
\v 19 that you thus should have crushed us down,
\q2 and covered us over with gloom,
\q2 in the place where the jackals roam.
\q
\v 20 Had we forgotten the name of our God,
\q2 or stretched out our hands to a god that was strange,
\q
\v 21 would God not have searched this out?
\q2 For he knows the heart and its secrets.
\q
\v 22 But in your cause it is we are killed all the day,
\q2 and counted as sheep for the slaughter.
\b
\q
\v 23 Rouse yourself, why do you sleep Lord?
\q2 Awake, cast us not off forever.
\q
\v 24 Why do you hide your face,
\q2 forgetting our stress and our misery?
\q
\v 25 For we have sunk down to the dust,
\q2 our bodies cling to the ground.
\q
\v 26 Arise, come to our help:
\q2 for your love's sake, ransom us.

\b
\q
\v 10 Listen, daughter, and see; and incline your ear:
\q2 forget your folk and your father's house.
\q
\v 11 And when the king desires your beauty,
\q2 bow to him, for he is your lord.
\q
\v 12 So shall the Tyrians come with gifts,
\q2 and the richest of people will do you homage.

\q2 praise God in a skilful song.
\q
\v 8 God is king over all the nations,
\q2 God sits on his holy throne.

\s Psalm 48 – The [us:Marvelous|cth:Marvellous] Deliverance of Zion
\d A song. A psalm of the Korahites.
\q
\v 1 Great is the \nd Lord\nd* and worthy all praise
\q2 in the city of our God.
\q His holy mountain,
\v 2 that rises so fair,
\q2 is the joy of all the world.
\q Like the mount of the gods is Mount Zion,
\q2 the city of the great king.
\b
\q
\v 3 Once God made himself known
\q2 as the defence of her palaces.
\q
\v 4 For see! A concert of kings
\q2 passed over the frontier together.
\q
\v 5 But one glance, and they were astounded;
\q2 they hastened away in dismay.
\q
\v 6 Trembling took hold of them there,
\q2 like the pains of a woman in [us:labor|cth:labour].
\q
\v 7 They were shattered, as east wind shatters
\q2 the giant ships in pieces.
\q
\v 8 What we heard, we now have seen
\q2 in the city of the \nd Lord\nd* of hosts,
\q the city of our God.
\q2 God will uphold her forever. \qs Selah\qs*
\b
\q
\v 9 We think, O God, of your love,
\q2 in the midst of your temple.
\q
\v 10 Your fame, O God, like your name, shall extend
\q2 to the ends of the earth.
\q Victory fills your hand.
\q2
\v 11 Let mount Zion be glad;
\q let the daughters of Judah rejoice
\q2 because of your judgments.
\q
\v 12 Walk about Zion, go round her;
\q2 count her towers.
\q
\v 13 Set your mind on her ramparts,
\q2 consider her palaces;
\q that you tell to the next generation
\q2
\v 14 That such is God,
\q our God he it is who shall guide us
\q2 [us:forever|cth:for ever] and ever.

\s Psalm 49 – The Problem of the Prosperity of the Wicked
\d For the leader. Of the Korahites. A psalm.
\q
\v 1 Hear this, you peoples all;
\q2 give ear, all you who live in the world
\q
\v 2 [neut:people|masc:men] of low degree and high,
\q2 the rich and the poor together.
\q
\v 3 My mouth shall utter wisdom,
\q2 the thoughts of a seeing heart.
\q
\v 4 I incline my ear to a proverb,
\q2 on the lyre I will open my riddle.
\b
\q
\v 5 Why should I be afraid in the days of misfortune,
\q2 when circled by wicked and cunning [neut:foes|masc:men],
\q
\v 6 who put their trust in their wealth,
\q2 and boast of their boundless riches?
\b
\q
\v 7 For assuredly no [neut:one|masc:man] can ransom [neut:themselves|masc:himself],
\q2 or give to God the price of [neut:their|masc:his] life,
\q
\v 8 for the ransom of a life is costly,
\q2 no payment is ever enough,
\q
\v 9 to keep [neut:them|masc:him] alive [us:forever|cth:for ever] and ever,
\q2 so as never to see the pit at all.
\b
\q
\v 10 But see it [neut:they|masc:he] will. Even wise [neut:people|masc:men] die,
\q2 the fool and the brutish perish alike,
\q2 and abandon their wealth to others.
\q
\v 11 The grave is their everlasting home,
\q2 the place they shall live in [us:forever|cth:for ever] and ever,
\q2 though after their own names they called whole lands.
\q
\v 12 Despite their wealth,
\q2 they perish like dumb animals.
\b
\q
\v 13 This is the fate of the confident fool,
\q2 and the end of those who are pleased with their portion. \qs Selah\qs*
\q
\v 14 Like sheep they descend to Sheol
\q2 with Death for their shepherd;
\q down they go straight to the grave,
\q2 and their form wastes away in their home below.
\b
\q
\v 15 But God will assuredly ransom my life
\q2 from the hand of Sheol;
\q2 for he will receive me. \qs Selah\qs*
\q
\v 16 So be not afraid when [neut:someone|masc:a man] grows rich,
\q2 when the wealth of [neut:their|masc:his] house increases.
\q
\v 17 Not a shred of it all can [neut:they|masc:he] take when [neut:they die|masc:he dies],
\q2 wealth cannot follow [neut:them|masc:him] down.
\q
\v 18 Though [neut:they count themselves|masc:he counts himself] happy, when [neut:they are|masc:he is] alive,
\q2 and [neut:win|masc:wins] praise from [neut:many|masc:men] for faring so well,
\q
\v 19 [neut:they|masc:he] must join [neut:their ancestors|masc:the race of his fathers],
\q2 who see the light nevermore.
\q
\v 20 The wealthy are without understanding,
\q2 they perish like dumb animals.

\d A psalm of Asaph.
\q
\v 1 The \nd Lord\nd* God has spoken: He summons the earth
\q2 from sunrise to sunset.
\q
\v 2 From Zion, perfection of beauty,
\q2 God's glory shines forth.
\q
\v 3 Our God comes, he cannot keep silence,
\q devouring fire is before him,
\q2 and furious tempest around him.
\q
\v 4 He summons the heavens above
\q2 and the earth to judge his people.
\q
\v 5 Gather to him his saints
\q2 by covenant-sacrifice bound to him;
\q
\v 6 that the heavens may declare his justice,
\q2 for a God of justice is he. \qs Selah\qs*
\b
\q
\v 7 “Hear, O my people, and I will speak,

\q2 I am the \nd Lord\nd*, your God.
\q
\v 8 Not for your sacrifices will I reprove you
\q2 your burnt-offerings are ever before me
\q
\v 9 Not a bullock will I take from your house,
\q2 nor he-goats out of your folds;
\q
\v 10 for all beasts of the forest are mine,
\q2 and the kine on a thousand hills.
\q
\v 11 I know all the birds of the air,
\q2 all that moves on the fields is mine.
\q
\v 12 Were I hungry, I would not tell you,
\q2 for the world and its fulness are mine.
\q
\v 13 Am I such as to eat bulls' flesh,
\q2 or drink the blood of goats?
\q
\v 14 Offer to God a thank-offering,
\q2 pay the Most High your vows.
\q
\v 15 Summon me in the day of distress,
\q2 I will rescue you, so will you [us:honor|cth:honour] me.”
\b
\q
\v 16 But to the wicked God says:
\q2 “What right have you to talk of my statutes,
\q2 or take my covenant into your mouth
\q
\v 17 while you yourself hate correction,
\q2 and cast my words behind you?
\q
\v 18 When you see a thief, you run with [neut:them|masc:him];
\q2 with adulterers you keep company.
\q
\v 19 You let your mouth loose for evil,
\q2 your tongue contrives deceit.
\q
\v 20 You shamefully speak of your [neut:kin|masc:brother],
\q2 and slander your own mother's son.
\q
\v 21 And because I kept silence at this,
\q2 you did take me for one like yourself.
\q2 But I will convict you and show you plainly.
\b
\q
\v 22 “Now you who forget God, mark this,
\q2 lest I rend you, past hope of deliverance.

\s Psalm 51 – God be Merciful to Me, the Sinner
\d For the leader. A psalm of David, when Nathan the prophet come to him after he had been with Bathsheba.
\q
\v 1 In your kindness, O God, be gracious to me,
\q2 in your own great pity blot out my transgressions.
\q
\v 2 Wash me clean of my guilt,
\q2 make me pure of my sin.
\b
\q
\v 3 For well I know my transgressions,
\q2 my sin is ever before me.
\q
\v 4 Against you, only you, have I sinned,
\q2 and done that which is wrong in your sight:
\q you therefore are just when you speak,
\q2 and clear when you utter judgment.
\q
\v 5 See! In guilt was I brought to the birth,
\q2 and in sin did my mother conceive me.
\q
\v 6 It's the innermost truth you desire,
\q2 give me therefore true wisdom of heart.
\b
\q
\v 7 Purge me clean with hyssop,
\q2 wash me whiter than snow.
\q
\v 8 Fill me with joy and gladness,
\q2 let the bones you have broken rejoice.
\q
\v 9 Hide your face from my sins,
\q2 and blot out my guilt altogether.
\b
\q
\v 10 Create me a clean heart, O God,
\q2 put a new steadfast spirit within me.
\q
\v 11 Cast me not forth from your presence,
\q2 withdraw not your holy spirit.
\q
\v 12 Give me back the joy of your help,
\q2 with a willing spirit sustain me.
\b
\q
\v 13 I will teach your ways to transgressors,
\q2 and sinners shall turn to you.
\q
\v 14 Save me from blood, O God,
\q2 and my tongue shall ring out your faithfulness.
\q
\v 15 Open my lips, O \nd Lord\nd*,
\q2 and my mouth shall declare your praise.
\b
\q
\v 16 For in sacrifice you have no pleasure,
\q2 in gifts of burnt-offering no delight.
\q
\v 17 The sacrifice pleasing to God
\q2 is a spirit that is broken;
\q a heart that is crushed, O God,
\q2 you will not despise.
\b
\q
\v 18 Do good in your pleasure to Zion,
\q2 build the walls of Jerusalem.
\q
\v 19 Then will you welcome the due forms of sacrifice,
\q2 then on your altars shall bullocks be offered.

\q
\v 1 Why glory in mischief, you hero?
\q2 God's kindness is all the day.
\q
\v 2 Engulfing ruin you plot,

\q2 you practiser of deceit.
\q
\v 3 Evil, not good, you love,
\q2 and falsehood, not words of truth. \qs Selah\qs*
\q
\v 4 But you love all words that devour,

\q2 grasp you and pluck you out of your tent,
\q2 and root you out of the land of the living. \qs Selah\qs*

\rem Revision 2
\d For the leader. On mahalath. A maskil of David.
\q
\v 1 Fools say in their heart,
\q2 “There is no God.”
\q Vile, hateful their life is;
\q2 not one does good.
\b
\q
\v 2 From heaven God looks out
\q2 on humans, to see
\q if any are wise,
\q2 and care for God.
\b
\q
\v 3 But all have turned bad,
\q2 the taint is on all;
\q not one does good,
\q2 no, not one.
\b
\q
\v 4 Have they learned their lesson,
\q2 those workers of evil?
\q Who ate up my people,
\q2 eating, devouring,
\q2 never calling to the \nd Lord\nd*.
\b
\q
\v 5 Sore afraid will they be,
\q2 where no fear was;
\q when God scatters the bones
\q2 of the godless people.
\q They will be put to shame,
\q2 when God rejects them.

\v 6 If only help from Zion
\q2 would come for Israel!

\q2 a change of fortune,
\q how glad will be Jacob,

\v 5 fear and trembling attack me,
\q2 and horror wraps me round.
\q
\v 6 O for the wings of a dove:
\q2 I would fly away and rest.
\q
\v 7 I would wander far away,
\q2 find refuge in the wilderness. \qs Selah\qs*

\q
\v 10 By day and by night they make their rounds

\q Her market-place is never free

\q2 heal its tottering breaches.
\q
\v 3 You have made your people drink hardship,
\q2 and given us wine of reeling.
\b
\q
\v 4 You have given those who fear you a banner,
\q2 a rallying-place from the bow, \qs Selah\qs*
\q
\v 5 for the rescue of your beloved.
\q2 Save by your right hand and answer us.
\b
\q
\v 6 God did solemnly swear:
\q2 “As victor will I divide Shechem,
\q2 and mete out the valley of Succoth.
\q
\v 7 Mine is Gilead, mine is Manasseh,
\q2 Ephraim is the defence of my head,
\q2 Judah my sceptre of rule,
\q
\v 8 Moab the pot that I wash in,
\q2 Edom – I cast my shoe over it,
\q2 I shout o'er Philistia in triumph.”
\b
\q
\v 9 O to be brought to the fortified city!
\q2 O to be led into Edom!
\q
\v 10 Have you not spurned us, O God?
\q2 You do not march forth with our armies.
\q
\v 11 Grant us help from the foe,
\q2 for human help is worthless.
\q
\v 12 With God we shall yet do bravely:
\q2 he himself will tread down our foes.

\q
\v 1 Hear my cry, O God,

\q
\v 2 From the ends of the earth I call
\q2 unto you, when my heart is faint:
\q lead me to the rock
\q2 that is high above me.
\q
\v 3 For you are a refuge to me,

\q
\v 4 O to be guest in your tent forever,

\q
\v 5 For you, O God, do hear my vows,

\s Psalm 62 – Quietness and Confidence
\d For the leader. On jeduthun. A psalm of David.
\q
\v 1 I wait alone in silence for God;
\q2 From him comes my help.
\q

\q2 I shall not be shaken too sorely.
\q
\v 3 How long will you, all of you, batter a man,
\q2 as one might a leaning wall?
\q
\v 4 From his height
\q2 they are planning to topple him.
\q They take pleasure in falsehood; they bless with their mouth,

\b
\q
\v 5 I wait alone in silence for God;

\q
\v 6 Yes, he is my rock, my help, my retreat,

\q2 set no vain hopes in robbery.
\q As for wealth, if it bears fruit,

\q
\v 11 One thing God has uttered,
\q2 two things there are which I heard
\q that power belongs to God,

\s Psalm 63 – Athirst for God
\d A psalm of David, when he was in the wilderness of Judah.
\q
\v 1 O God, my God, you, you do I seek:
\q2 my heart thirsts for you,
\q my body faints for you
\q2 in a parched and waterless land.
\b
\q
\v 2 As I in the temple have seen you,
\q2 beholding your power and your glory,
\q
\v 3 for better than life is your kindness:
\q2 my lips shall utter your praise.
\b
\q
\v 4 So, while I live, I will bless you,
\q2 and lift up my hands in your name.
\q
\v 5 As with marrow and fat am I feasted;
\q2 with joyful lips I will praise you.
\b
\q
\v 6 I call you to mind on my bed,
\q2 and muse on you in the night watches;
\q
\v 7 for you have been my help,
\q2 I joyfully sing in the shadow of your wings.
\q
\v 8 I cling close after you,
\q2 your right hand holds me up.
\b
\q
\v 9 But those who seek after my life
\q2 shall go down to the depths of the earth,
\q
\v 10 given o'er to the power of the sword,
\q2 or as prey for jackals to devour.
\b
\q
\v 11 But the king shall rejoice in God:
\q2 all who own his allegiance will glory.
\q2 For the mouth of the false shall be stopped.

\s Psalm 64 – A Prayer for Deliverance from Malicious Foes
\d For the leader. A psalm of David.
\q
\v 1 Hear, O my God, the voice of my lament:
\q2 guard my life from the foe who affrights me.
\q
\v 2 Hide me from villains who secretly plot,
\q2 from the blustering throng of the workers of evil,
\q
\v 3 who have sharpened their tongue like a sword,
\q2 and aimed bitter words like arrows,
\q
\v 4 which from ambush they launch at the blameless,
\q2 shooting swiftly and unafraid.
\b
\q
\v 5 They strengthen their wicked purpose,
\q2 they tell of the snares they have hidden,
\q2 they say to themselves, “Who can see?”
\q
\v 6 They think out their crimes full cunningly
\q2 hidden deep in their crafty hearts.
\b
\q
\v 7 But God with his arrow will shoot them,
\q2 swiftly shall they be smitten.
\q
\v 8 For their tongue he will bring them to ruin,
\q2 all will shudder with horror at the sight of them.
\b
\q
\v 9 Then every [neut:person|masc:man], touched to awe,
\q2 as [neut:they ponder|masc:he ponders] what God has wrought,
\q2 will tell the tale of his deeds.
\q
\v 10 In the \nd Lord\nd* shall the righteous rejoice,
\q2 in him shall they take refuge;
\q2 and all the true-hearted shall glory.

\d For the leader. A psalm of David. A song.
\q
\v 1 It is seemly to praise you, O God, in Zion,
\q2 and to you shall the vow be performed in Jerusalem.
\q
\v 2 O you who hear prayer,
\q2 unto you shall all flesh come.
\q
\v 3 Our sins are too mighty for us,
\q2 our transgressions you only can cover them.
\q
\v 4 Happy the [neut:person who|masc:man whom] you choose
\q2 to live beside you in your courts.
\q O may we be filled with the joys
\q2 of your house, of your holy temple.
\b
\q
\v 5 In dread deeds you loyally answer us,
\q2 O God of our salvation,
\q whom all ends of the earth put their trust in,
\q2 and islands far away.
\q
\v 6 By your strength you establish the hills,
\q2 you are armed with might;
\q
\v 7 you still the roaring of seas,
\q2 and the turmoil of nations,
\q
\v 8 so that those who live at earth's bounds
\q2 are awed at your signs:
\q the lands of the sunrise and sunset
\q2 you make to ring with joy.
\b
\q
\v 9 You visit and water the earth;
\q2 you greatly enrich her
\q with the river of God, which is full of water.
\q2 You prepare the corn thereof,
\q
\v 10 watering her furrows,
\q2 settling her ridges;
\q you make her soft with showers,
\q2 and bless what grows thereon.
\q
\v 11 You crown the year with your goodness,
\q2 your chariot-tracks drip with fatness.
\q
\v 12 The desert pastures are lush,
\q2 the hills greened with joy.
\q
\v 13 The meadows are clothed with flocks,
\q2 the valleys are covered with corn;
\q2 they shout to each other and sing.

\s Psalm 66 – Thanksgiving for National Deliverance
\d For the leader. A song. A psalm.
\q
\v 1 Shout to God, all the earth,

\v 2 sing praise to his glorious name,
\q2 sing his glorious praise.
\q
\v 3 Say to God, “How dread are your works,
\q2 so great is your might that your enemies cringe to you.
\q
\v 4 All the earth does homage to you,
\q2 singing praises to you,
\q2 singing praise to your name.” \qs Selah\qs*
\b
\q
\v 5 Come and see what God has done,

\q
\v 6 He turns the sea into dry land,
\q2 and [neut:people|masc:men] cross the river on foot.
\q Let us therefore rejoice in him,
\q2
\v 7 the mighty Ruler eternal,
\q whose eyes keep watch on the nations,
\q2 that no rebel lift up his head. \qs Selah\qs*
\b
\q
\v 8 O bless our God, you peoples;
\q2 sound aloud his praise,
\q
\v 9 who keeps us in life,
\q2 and keeps our feet from slipping.
\q
\v 10 For you, God, have tested us,
\q2 have tried us, as silver is tried.
\q
\v 11 You did bring us into prison,
\q2 and put chains upon us,
\q
\v 12 you did let [neut:people|masc:men] ride over our head.
\q2 We went through fire and through water,
\q2 but you led us out to a spacious place.
\b
\q
\v 13 I will enter your house with burnt-offerings,
\q2 I will pay to you my vows,
\q
\v 14 which my open lips have uttered,
\q2 arid my mouth has declared in my straits.
\q
\v 15 I will offer you offerings of fatlings,
\q2 with the odour of burning rams,
\q2 I will sacrifice bullocks with goats. \qs Selah\qs*
\b
\q
\v 16 Come and hear my story
\q2 all who fear God –
\q2 of what he has done for me.
\q
\v 17 For my mouth had no sooner invoked him
\q2 than his praise was under my tongue.
\q
\v 18 Had I cherished sin in my heart,
\q2 the \nd Lord\nd* would never have listened.
\q
\v 19 But assuredly God has listened,
\q2 and attended to my loud prayer.
\b
\q
\v 20 Blessed be God, who turned not aside
\q2 my prayer, nor withdrew his kindness from me.

\d For the leader. Of David. A psalm. A song.
\q
\v 1 God arises, his enemies scatter:

\q
\v 2 As smoke before wind is driven,
\q2 as wax melts before fire,
\q2 so before God vanish the wicked.
\q
\v 3 But the righteous rejoice in God's presence,
\q2 they exult with exceeding joy.
\b
\q
\v 4 Sing to God, make music to his name,
\q2 his name is the \nd Lord\nd*, praise him who rides on the clouds,

\q
\v 5 Father of orphans, defender of widows,
\q2 is God in his holy abode.
\q
\v 6 God brings home the lonely,

\v 7 God, when you went in front of your people
\q2 in your march through the desert, \qs Selah\qs*
\q
\v 8 earth shook, the heavens poured rain
\q2 at the presence of God, Sinai's God
\q at the presence of God, Israel's God.
\q
\v 9 Rain in abundance, God, you did sprinkle,
\q2 restoring the languishing land of your heritage.
\q
\v 10 A dwelling therein your people found:
\q2 in your goodness, O God, you did care for the poor.
\b
\q
\v 11 The \nd Lord\nd* spoke the glad tidings of victory,
\q2 a great army of women proclaim it:
\q
\v 12 “Kings of armies they flee, they flee,
\q2 and the housewife divides the spoil:
\q
\v 13 dove's wings covered with silver
\q2 and pinions with shimmer of gold,
\q2
\v 14 set with stones, like snow upon Zalmon.”
\b
\q
\v 15 A mountain of God is the mountain of Bashan,
\q2 a mountain of peaks is the mountain of Bashan.
\q
\v 16 You high-peaked mountains, why look you askance
\q2 at the mountain which God has desired for his home
\q2 whereon the \nd Lord\nd* will live forever?
\q
\v 17 The chariots of God are twice ten thousand:
\q2 the \nd Lord\nd* came from Sinai, his holy place.
\q
\v 18 You did mount the height with trains of your captives,
\q2 and gifts that you had received [neut:from the people|masc:among men].
\q2 The rebels shall live with the \nd Lord\nd* God.

\v 21 Yes, God will shatter the head of his foes
\q2 the rough scalp of [neut:those who strut on in their|masc:him who struts on in his] sins.

\s Psalm 69 – A Prayer for Deliverance and Vengeance
\d For the leader. On shoshannim. Of David.
\q
\v 1 Save me, O God; for the waters
\q2 are threatening my life.
\q
\v 2 I am sunk in depths of mire,
\q2 where ground there is none.
\q I am come into deep deep waters,
\q2 the flood overwhelms me.
\q
\v 3 I am weary of crying, my throat is parched,
\q2 my eyes are wasted with waiting for God.
\b
\q
\v 4 More than the hairs of my head
\q2 are those who wantonly hate me.
\q More than my bones in number
\q2 are those who are falsely my foes.
\q That which I never robbed,
\q2 how am I then to restore?
\q
\v 5 O God, you know my folly,
\q2 my guilt is not hidden from you.
\q
\v 6 Through me let not any be shamed,
\q2 who wait for you, \nd Lord\nd* God of hosts.
\q Through me let not those be confounded
\q2 who seek you, O God of Israel.
\q
\v 7 It's in your cause that I have borne taunts,
\q2 and my face has been covered with shame;
\q
\v 8 I became to my [neut:kindred|masc:brothers] a foreigner,
\q2 to my mother's sons a stranger.
\b
\q
\v 9 It was zeal for your house that consumed me,
\q2 and the insults they hurled at you fell upon me.
\q
\v 10 When I chastened myself with fasting,
\q2 they took occasion to taunt me.
\q
\v 11 When I put on a garment of sackcloth,
\q2 they made me the theme of a taunt-song.
\q
\v 12 Those who sit in the gate make sport of me
\q2 in the music of drunken songs.
\b
\q
\v 13 But I pray to you, \nd Lord\nd*,
\q2 for a time of [us:favor|cth:favour].
\q In your great love answer me;
\q2 with your loyal help, save me
\q
\v 14 from sinking down in the mire.
\q2 Lift me out of the deep deep waters,
\q
\v 15 that the rushing flood may not drown me,
\q2 that the deep may not swallow me up,
\q2 nor the pit close her mouth upon me.
\q
\v 16 Answer me, \nd Lord\nd*, in your gracious kindness,
\q2 turn to me in your great compassion.
\q
\v 17 Hide not your face from your servant,
\q2 for I am in trouble; O answer me speedily.
\q
\v 18 Draw near to me, redeem me;
\q2 because of my enemies, ransom me.
\b
\q
\v 19 You know how I am insulted;
\q2 in your sight are all my foes.
\q
\v 20 Insult has broken my heart,
\q2 past cure are my shame and confusion.
\q For pity I looked – there was none!
\q2 And for comforters, but I found none.
\q
\v 21 Poison they gave me for food,
\q2 and to slake my thirst they gave vinegar.
\b
\q
\v 22 May their table, outspread, be a trap to them,
\q2 and their peace-offerings be a snare.
\q
\v 23 May their eyes be darkened and blind,
\q2 make them shake without ceasing.
\q
\v 24 Pour your indignation upon them,
\q2 let your burning wrath overtake them.
\q
\v 25 May their camp be a desolation,
\q2 in their tents be there none to live.
\q
\v 26 For [neut:those|masc:him] whom you struck, they persecute,
\q2 and those whom you wounded, they pain yet more.
\q
\v 27 Charge them with sin upon sin,
\q2 may they not be acquitted by you.
\q
\v 28 From the book of life be they blotted,
\q2 may their names not be written with the righteous.
\b
\q
\v 29 Lift me, O God, by your help
\q2 above my pain and misery.
\q
\v 30 Then will I praise God in song
\q2 and magnify him with thanksgiving,
\q
\v 31 which shall please the \nd Lord\nd* better than ox,
\q2 or than bullock with horns and hoofs.
\q
\v 32 The oppressed shall rejoice at the sight.
\q2 You who seek after God, let your heart revive.
\q
\v 33 For the \nd Lord\nd* listens to the poor,
\q2 he does not despise his prisoners.
\b
\q
\v 34 Let the heavens and the earth sing his praises,
\q2 the seas, and all creatures that move in them.
\q
\v 35 For God will bring help to Zion,
\q2 and build up the cities of Judah,
\q2 his people shall live there in possession.
\q
\v 36 His servants' children shall have it for heritage,
\q2 and those who love him shall live therein.

\q
\v 7 I have been as a wonder to many,
\q2 for you are my refuge and strength.

\q
\v 9 Cast me not off in the time of old age;
\q2 when my strength is spent, forsake me not.
\q
\v 10 For my foes whisper against me,
\q2 they who watch me take counsel together;
\q
\v 11 “God has left him,” they say: “pursue
\q2 and seize him, for he is helpless.”
\b
\q
\v 12 O God, be not far from me,
\q2 haste, O my God, to my help.
\q
\v 13 Put my foes to shame and [us:dishonor|cth:dishonour],

\v 14 But I will never stop hoping,
\q2 and more and yet more will I praise you.

\b
\q
\v 16 I will tell of the might of the \nd Lord\nd*,

\q
\v 17 You have taught me, O God, from my youth,

\q
\v 18 Even in old age and grey hair,
\q2 O God, do not forsake me.
\q Still would I tell of your might

\q2 who were seeking my hurt.

\s Psalm 72 – A Prayer for a Just and Glorious Reign
\d Of Solomon.
\q
\v 1 Give the king, O God, your own spirit of justice
\q2 your spirit of right to the son of the king,
\q
\v 2 that with right he may judge your people,
\q2 and your downtrodden ones with justice.
\b
\q
\v 3 May the mountains bear weal for the people,
\q2 and the hills yield fruits of justice.
\q
\v 4 The weak may he help to their rights,
\q2 may he save the sons of the needy
\q2 and crush the oppressor in pieces.
\b
\q
\v 5 May he live as long as the sun,
\q2 while the moon shines – for ages and ages.
\q
\v 6 May he be like the rain on the meadow,
\q2 like showers that water the earth.
\b
\q
\v 7 In his days may justice flourish,
\q2 and welfare abound, till the moon be no more.
\q
\v 8 May he reign from ocean to ocean,
\q2 from the river to the ends of the earth.
\b
\q
\v 9 May his foes bow down before him,
\q2 his enemies lick the dust.
\q
\v 10 May tribute be rendered by kings
\q2 of the isles and of Tarshish;
\q may gifts be brought by the kings
\q2 of Sheba and Seba.
\b
\q
\v 11 May all kings fall prostrate before him,
\q2 and all nations yield him their service.
\q
\v 12 For he saves the poor when he cries,
\q2 the helpless and the downtrodden.
\b
\q
\v 13 He pities the weak and the poor,
\q2 he saves the lives of the poor.
\q
\v 14 He redeems them from wrong and from violence,
\q2 for dear is their blood in his sight.
\b
\q
\v 15 Long may he live;
\q2 and may gold of Sheba be given him;
\q prayer, too, be made for him ceaselessly,
\q2 all the day long may men bless him.
\b
\q
\v 16 May the land have abundance of corn,
\q2 to the tops of the hills may it wave.
\q May the fruit thereof flourish like Lebanon,
\q2 may men spring from the city like grass of the earth.
\b
\q
\v 17 May his name be blessed forever,
\q2 may his fame endure as the sun.
\q May all nations envy his blessedness,
\q2 all tribes of the earth call him happy.
\b
\b
\b
\q3
\v 18 \em Blest be the \+nd Lord\+nd* God, Israel's God,\em*
\q3 \em who alone does wonders;\em*
\q3
\v 19 \em And blest be forever his glorious name.\em*
\q3 \em Let all the earth be filled with his glory.\em*
\q3 \em Amen and Amen.\em*
\b
\q3
\v 20 Here end the prayers of David, son of Jesse.

\ms Book Three
\s Psalm 73 – Fellowship with God Here and Hereafter
\d A psalm of Asaph.
\q
\v 1 Yes, God is good to the upright,
\q2 the \nd Lord\nd* to the pure in heart.
\q
\v 2 But my feet were almost gone,
\q2 my steps had nearly slipped,
\q
\v 3 through envy of godless braggarts,
\q2 when I saw how well they fared.
\b
\q
\v 4 For never a pang have they,
\q2 their body is sound and sleek.
\q
\v 5 They have no trouble like mortals,
\q2 no share in human pain.
\q
\v 6 So they wear their pride like a necklace,
\q2 they put on the garment of wrong,
\q
\v 7 their eyes stand out with fatness,
\q2 their heart swells with riotous fancies.
\q
\v 8 Their speech is mocking and evil,
\q2 condescending and crooked their speech.
\q
\v 9 They have set their mouth in the heavens,
\q2 while their tongue struts about on the earth.
\q
\v 10 Small wonder that people resort to them,
\q2 and drink deep draughts of their lore.
\q
\v 11 “How does God know?” they say,
\q2 “And has the Most High any knowledge?”
\q
\v 12 See! These are the godless,
\q2 with wealth and ease ever increasing.
\b
\q
\v 13 Yes, in vain have I kept my heart pure,
\q2 and washed my hands in innocence;
\q
\v 14 for all the day long was I plagued
\q2 not a morning but I was chastised.
\q
\v 15 But to resolve to speak like they do
\q2 would be treachery to your children.
\b
\q
\v 16 So I sought to understand it,
\q2 but a wearisome task it seemed:
\q
\v 17 till I entered the holy world of God
\q2 and saw clearly their destiny.
\b
\q
\v 18 Yes, you set them on slippery places;
\q2 down to destruction you hurl them.
\q
\v 19 One moment and then what a horror of ruin!
\q2 They are finished and ended in terrors.
\q
\v 20 Like a dream, when one wakes, shall they be,
\q2 whose phantoms the waker despises.
\b
\q
\v 21 So my bitterness of mind
\q2 and the pain that stabbed my heart
\q
\v 22 show how dull I was and stupid
\q2 just like a beast before you.
\b
\q
\v 23 But I am always with you,
\q2 you have hold of my right hand.
\q
\v 24 By a plan of yours you guide me
\q2 and will afterward take me to glory.
\b
\q
\v 25 Whom have I in the heavens but you?
\q2 And on earth there is none I desire beside you.
\q
\v 26 Though flesh and heart waste away,
\q2 yet God is the rock of my heart,
\q2 yet God is my portion forever.
\b
\q
\v 27 For see! Those who are far from you must perish,
\q2 you destroy all who are false to you.
\q
\v 28 But I am happy when close to God;
\q2 the \nd Lord\nd* my God I have made my refuge,
\q2 that I may recount all the things you have done.

\c 74
\s Psalm 74 – Lament on the Devastation of the Temple
\d A maskil of Asaph.
\q
\v 1 Why, O God, have you spurned us forever?
\q2 Why smokes your wrath against the sheep of your pasture?
\q
\v 2 Remember the community you purchased of old
\q2 to become by redemption the tribe of your heritage,
\q2 Zion, the mountain you made your home.
\q
\v 3 Rouse yourself, visit its ruins complete.
\q2 In the temple the foe has made havoc of all things.
\b
\q
\v 4 Like lions your enemies roared through your house,
\q2 replacing our symbols by signs of their own,
\q
\v 5 hacking, like woodsmen who lift
\q2 axes on thickets of trees,
\q
\v 6 smashing with hatchets and hammers
\q2 all of its carved work together.
\q
\v 7 They have set your temple on fire,
\q2 to the very ground they have outraged
\q2 the place where lives your name.
\q
\v 8 They have said in their heart, “Let us utterly crush them.”
\q2 They have burned all the houses of God in the land.
\b
\q
\v 9 No symbol of ours do we see any more:
\q2 no prophet is there any more,
\q2 none is with us who knows how long.
\q
\v 10 How long, O God, is the foe to insult?
\q2 Shall the enemy spurn your name forever?
\q
\v 11 Why, O \nd Lord\nd*, do you hold back your hand,
\q2 why keep your right hand in the folds of your robe?
\b
\q
\v 12 Yet God is our king from the ancient days,
\q2 in the midst of the earth working deeds of salvation.
\q
\v 13 It was you who did cleave the sea by your might,
\q2 and shatter the heads of the ocean monsters.
\q
\v 14 It was you who did crush many-headed Leviathan,
\q2 and give him as food to the beasts of the wilderness.
\q
\v 15 It was you who did cleave the fountains and torrents;
\q2 it was you who did dry the perennial streams.
\q
\v 16 Yours is the day; yours, too, is the night,
\q2 it was you who did establish the sun and the star.
\q
\v 17 It was you who did fix all the borders of earth:
\q2 summer and winter it's you who have made them.
\b
\q
\v 18 Yet, for all this, the foe has insulted you, \nd Lord\nd*,
\q2 and a nation of fools has reviled your name.
\q
\v 19 Do not give your dove to the beasts,
\q2 do not forget your afflicted forever.
\q
\v 20 Look to the sleek ones – how full they are:
\q2 the dark places of earth are the dwellings of violence.
\q
\v 21 O let not the downtrodden turn back ashamed:
\q2 let the poor and the needy sing praise to your name.
\b
\q
\v 22 Arise, God, and defend your cause:
\q2 remember how fools all the day insult you.
\q
\v 23 Do not forget the uproar of your enemies,
\q2 the din of your foes that ascends evermore.

\s Psalm 75 – God the Judge
\d For the leader; al tashheth. A psalm of Asaph, a song.
\q
\v 1 We praise you, God, we praise you:
\q2 we would call on your name and declare your wonders.
\b
\q
\v 2 “At the time I choose,
\q2 I will judge fairly.
\q
\v 3 Though earth melt and all her inhabitants,
\q2 it is I who keep steady her pillars.” \qs Selah\qs*
\q
\v 4 I say to the boasters, “Boast not”;
\q2 to the wicked, “Lift not up your horn:
\q
\v 5 lift not your horn on high,
\q2 speak not boldly against the Rock.”
\b
\q
\v 6 For not from east nor west,
\q2 not from desert nor mountains;
\q
\v 7 but God himself is the judge,
\q2 humbling one and exalting another.
\b
\q
\v 8 In the hand of the \nd Lord\nd* is a cup
\q2 foaming wine, richly spiced.
\q Out of this he pours a draught,
\q2 and all the wicked of earth
\q2 must drain it down to the dregs.
\b
\q
\v 9 But I will rejoice forever,
\q2 singing praise to the God of Jacob.
\q
\v 10 I will hew all the horns of the wicked,
\q2 but the horns of the just shall be lifted.

\c 76
\s Psalm 76 – A Song of Victory
\d For the leader. With instrumental music. A psalm of Asaph, a song.
\q
\v 1 God has made himself known in Judah,
\q2 his name is great in Israel.
\q
\v 2 His tent is in Salem,
\q2 his dwelling in Zion.
\b
\q
\v 3 There he broke the lightning arrows,
\q2 shield, sword, and weapons of war. \qs Selah\qs*
\q
\v 4 Terrible is your [us:splendor|cth:splendour]
\q2 on the everlasting mountains.
\b
\q
\v 5 Despoiled were the stout of heart;
\q2 in the sleep into which they had fallen,
\q none of the [neut:warriors|masc:men of valour]
\q2 could lift a hand.
\b
\q
\v 6 At your rebuke, God of Jacob,
\q2 sank chariot and horse to sleep.
\q
\v 7 Awful are you: who can stand
\q2 before you, when once you are angry?
\b
\q
\v 8 The judgment you gave from heaven
\q2 frightened the earth into silence,
\q
\v 9 when God arose to judgment
\q2 to save the oppressed of the earth. \qs Selah\qs*
\b
\q
\v 10 The fiercest will praise you,
\q2 to you will the remnant hold festival.
\q
\v 11 Vow and pay to \nd Lord\nd* your God,
\q2 and let all who are round him bring presents.
\b
\q
\v 12 He lops off the courage of princes,
\q2 and with terror fills kings of the earth.

\c 77
\s Psalm 77 – A Prayer for Preservation as in the Days of Old
\d For the leader. On Jeduthun. Of Asaph, a psalm.
\q
\v 1 Loudly will I lift my cry to God,
\q2 loudly to God, so he hears to me.
\q
\v 2 In the day of my trouble I seek the \nd Lord\nd*;
\q2 in the night I lift my hands in prayer,
\q2 refusing all comfort.
\b
\q
\v 3 When I think of God, I moan;
\q2 when I muse, my spirit is faint. \qs Selah\qs*
\q
\v 4 When you hold my eyes awake,
\q2 and I am restless and speechless,
\q
\v 5 I think of the days of old,
\q2 call to mind distant years.
\q
\v 6 I commune with my heart in the night,
\q2 I muse with inquiring spirit.
\q
\v 7 “Will the \nd Lord\nd* cast us off forever,
\q2 will he be gracious no more?
\q
\v 8 Has his love vanished forever?
\q2 Is his faithfulness utterly gone?
\q
\v 9 Has God forgotten to be gracious,
\q2 or in anger withheld his compassion?” \qs Selah\qs*
\b
\q
\v 10 Then I said, “This it is that grieves me,
\q2 that the hand of the Most High has changed.”
\q
\v 11 I will think of the deeds of the \nd Lord\nd*,
\q2 and remember your wonders of old.
\q
\v 12 I will muse on all you have wrought,
\q2 and meditate on your deeds.
\q
\v 13 Then your way, O God, was majestic:
\q2 what God was great as our God?
\q
\v 14 You were a God who did marvels,
\q2 you did show your power to the world
\q
\v 15 by your arm you rescued your people,
\q2 the children of Jacob and Joseph. \qs Selah\qs*
\b
\q
\v 16 The waters saw you, O God.
\q2 The waters saw you and shivered;
\q2 to their depths they trembled.
\q
\v 17 Clouds poured torrents of water,
\q2 thunder rolled in the sky,
\q2 your arrows sped to and fro.
\q
\v 18 Loud was the roll of your thunder,
\q2 lightnings lit up the world.
\q2 Earth quaked and trembled.
\q
\v 19 In your way, \nd Lord\nd*, through the sea,
\q2 in your path through the mighty waters,
\q2 your footsteps were all unseen.
\q
\v 20 You did guide your folk like a flock
\q2 by the hand of Moses and Aaron.

\c 78
\s Psalm 78 – The Warnings of History
\d A maskil of Asaph.
\q
\v 1 My people, give ear to my teaching:
\q2 bend your ears to the words of my mouth,
\q
\v 2 as I open my mouth in a poem
\q2 on the riddling story of the past.
\b
\q
\v 3 What we have heard and known,
\q2 and what our [neut:ancestors|masc:fathers] have told us,
\q
\v 4 we will not hide from their children.
\q2 We will tell to the next generation
\q the praises and might of the \nd Lord\nd*,
\q2 and the wonders that he has done.
\b
\q
\v 5 He set up a testimony in Jacob,
\q2 a law he appointed in Israel,
\q which he commanded our [neut:ancestors|masc:fathers]
\q2 to make known to their children,
\q
\v 6 that the next generation should know it,
\q2 that the children yet to be born
\q should arise and tell their children;
\q2
\v 7 that in God they might put their confidence,
\q and not forget God's works;
\q2 but that they might keep his commandments,
\q
\v 8 and not be like their [neut:ancestors|masc:fathers],
\q2 a generation defiant and stubborn,
\q a generation with heart unsteady,
\q2 and spirit unfaithful towards God.
\b
\q
\v 9 Ephraimites, armed bowmen,
\q2 turned back in the day of battle.
\q
\v 10 They did not keep God's covenant,
\q2 they refused to walk in his law.
\q
\v 11 They forgot what he had done,
\q2 and the wonders he had shown them.
\b
\q
\v 12 He did wonders before their [neut:ancestors|masc:fathers]
\q2 in the country of Zoan in Egypt.
\q
\v 13 Through the sea which he split he brought them,
\q2 making waters stand up like a heap;
\q
\v 14 he led them by day with a cloud,
\q2 all the night with a light of fire.
\b
\q
\v 15 From the rocks which he split in the wilderness,
\q2 he gave them to drink as of ocean's abundance.
\q
\v 16 He brought streams out of the rock,
\q2 and made water run down like rivers.
\b
\q
\v 17 Yet they still went on sinning against him,
\q2 they defied the Most High in the desert.
\q
\v 18 They [us:willfully|cth:wilfully] challenged God,
\q2 demanding the food that they longed for.
\q
\v 19 “Is God able,” such was their challenge,
\q2 “to spread in the desert a table?
\q
\v 20 From the rock that he struck there gushed water,
\q2 and torrents that overflowed;
\q but can he also give bread,
\q2 or provide his people with meat?”
\b
\q
\v 21 When the \nd Lord\nd* heard this, he was furious,
\q2 and fire was kindled on Jacob,
\q2 anger flared up against Israel.
\b
\q
\v 22 For they put no trust in God,
\q2 no confidence in his help.
\q
\v 23 So he summoned the clouds above;
\q2 and, opening the doors of heaven,
\q
\v 24 he rained manna upon them for food,
\q2 and grain of heaven he gave them.
\q
\v 25 [neut:Everyone|masc:Men] ate the bread of angels;
\q2 he sent them food to the full.
\b
\q
\v 26 He launched the east wind in the heavens,
\q2 and guided the south by his power.
\q
\v 27 He rained meat upon them like dust,
\q2 winged bird like the sand of the sea.
\q
\v 28 In the midst of their camp he dropped it,
\q2 all around their tents.
\b
\q
\v 29 They ate and were more than filled;
\q2 he had brought them the thing they desired.
\q
\v 30 But the thing they desired became loathsome:
\q2 while their food was still in their mouths,
\q
\v 31 the wrath of God rose against them.
\q2 He slew the stoutest among them,
\q2 and laid low the young men of Israel.
\b
\q
\v 32 Yet for all this they sinned yet more,
\q2 and refused to believe in his wonders.
\q
\v 33 So he ended their days in a breath,
\q2 and their years in sudden dismay.
\q
\v 34 When he slew them, then they sought after him,
\q2 they turned and sought God with diligence.
\b
\q
\v 35 They remembered that God was their rock,
\q2 and the Most High God their redeemer.
\q
\v 36 But they flattered him with their mouth,
\q2 and lied to him with their tongue.
\q
\v 37 Their heart was not steady with him,
\q2 they were faithless to his covenant.
\b
\q
\v 38 But he is full of pity:
\q2 he pardons sin and destroys not.
\q Often he turns his anger away,
\q2 without stirring his wrath at all.
\q
\v 39 So he remembered that they were but flesh,
\q2 breath that passes and does not return.
\b
\q
\v 40 But how often they rebelled in the desert,
\q2 and caused him grief in the wilderness,
\q
\v 41 tempting God again and again,
\q2 provoking the Holy One of Israel.
\q
\v 42 They did not remember his strength,
\q2 nor the day he redeemed from the foe,
\q
\v 43 how he set his signs in Egypt,
\q2 in the country of Zoan his wonders.
\b
\q
\v 44 He turned their canals into blood,
\q2 their streams undrinkable.
\q
\v 45 He sent forth flies, which devoured them;
\q2 frogs, too, which destroyed them.
\q
\v 46 Their crops he gave to the caterpillar,
\q2 and the fruits of their toil to the locust.
\q
\v 47 He slew their vines with hail,
\q2 and their sycamore trees with frost.
\q
\v 48 He delivered their cattle to the hail,
\q2 and their flocks to bolts of fire.
\b
\q
\v 49 He let loose his hot anger among them,
\q2 fury and wrath and distress,
\q2 a band of destroying angels.
\q
\v 50 He cleared a path for his anger,
\q2 did not spare them from death,
\q2 but gave them over to pestilence.
\b
\q
\v 51 He struck down all the first-born in Egypt,
\q2 the first fruits of their strength in the tents of Ham.
\q
\v 52 He led forth his people like sheep,
\q2 he was guide to his flock in the desert.
\q
\v 53 Securely he led them, and free from fear,
\q2 while their foes were drowned in the sea.
\b
\q
\v 54 To his holy realm he brought them,
\q2 to the mountain his right hand had purchased.
\q
\v 55 He drove out the nations before them,
\q2 and allotted their land for possession,
\q2 and their tents for Israel to live in.
\b
\q
\v 56 Yet they tempted and angered the Most High God,
\q2 they did not observe his decrees.
\q
\v 57 They drew back, false like their [neut:ancestors|masc:fathers];
\q2 they failed like a treacherous bow.
\q
\v 58 Their shrines stirred him to anger,
\q2 their idols moved him to jealousy.
\b
\q
\v 59 When God heard of this, he was furious,
\q2 and he spurned Israel utterly.
\q
\v 60 He abandoned his home in Shiloh,
\q2 the tent he had pitched among [neut:people|masc:men].
\q
\v 61 He gave his strength up to captivity,
\q2 his glory to the hands of the foe.
\b
\q
\v 62 He gave his people to the sword,
\q2 he was furious with his own.
\q
\v 63 Fire devoured their young men,
\q2 and their maidens had no marriage-song.
\q
\v 64 Their priests fell by the sword,
\q2 and their widows could not weep.
\b
\q
\v 65 Then the \nd Lord\nd* awoke as from sleep,
\q2 like a warrior flushed with wine;
\q
\v 66 and he beat back his foes,
\q2 putting them to perpetual scorn.
\q
\v 67 He disowned the tent of Joseph,
\q2 he rejected the tribe of Ephraim;
\q
\v 68 but he chose the tribe of Judah,
\q2 Mount Zion, which he loves.
\q
\v 69 And he built like the heights his sanctuary,
\q2 like the earth which he founded forever.
\b
\q
\v 70 And he chose David his servant,
\q2 taking him from the sheepfolds.
\q
\v 71 From the mother-ewes he brought him,
\q2 to be shepherd to Jacob his people,
\q2 and to Israel his inheritance.
\q
\v 72 With upright heart did he shepherd them,
\q2 and with skilful hands did he guide them.

\d A psalm of Asaph.
\q
\v 1 Heathen, O God, have come into your land,
\q2 defiling your holy temple,
\q2 and laying Jerusalem in ruins.
\q
\v 2 They have given the bodies of your dead servants
\q2 to the birds of the air to devour,
\q2 and the flesh of your faithful to the beasts of the field.
\q
\v 3 Round about Jerusalem
\q2 they have poured out their blood like water;
\q2 and there was no one to bury them.
\q
\v 4 On every side our [us:neighbors|cth:neighbours]
\q2 revile us and mock us and jeer at us.
\b
\q
\v 5 How long will you be angry, O \nd Lord\nd*?
\q2 Will your jealousy burn like fire forever?
\q
\v 6 Pour out your wrath on the nations that don't know you,
\q2 on the kingdoms that do not call on your name.
\q
\v 7 For Jacob they devoured,
\q2 they have desolated his home.
\q
\v 8 Do not remember against us our [neut:ancestors'|masc:fathers'] sins;
\q2 O meet us soon with your pity,
\q2 for utterly weak are we.
\b
\q
\v 9 Help us, O God our [us:savior|cth:saviour],
\q2 for the renown of your name:
\q for your reputation deliver us
\q2 and cover over our sins.
\q
\v 10 Why should the nations say,
\q2 “Where is their God?”
\q Let revenge for the outpoured blood of your servants
\q2 be shown on the heathen before our eyes.
\q
\v 11 May the groans of the prisoner come before you;
\q2 free the children of death by your mighty arm.
\q
\v 12 Pay our [us:neighbors|cth:neighbours] back sevenfold
\q2 for the scorn they have heaped upon you, O \nd Lord\nd*.
\b
\q
\v 13 Then we, your people, the flock of your pasture,
\q2 will give thanks to you for evermore,
\q2 and tell your praise to all generations.

\q from your throne on the cherubs shine forth
\q2
\v 2 before Ephraim, Manasseh, and Benjamin.
\q Stir up your mighty power,

\q2 so we may be saved.
\b
\q
\v 4 O \nd Lord\nd* of hosts,
\q how long is your anger to smoke,
\q2 despite the prayer of your people?
\q
\v 5 You have fed them with bread of tears,

\v 8 A vine out of Egypt you brought;

\q
\v 10 The shade of her covered the mountains,
\q2 her branches the cedars of God.
\q
\v 11 She sent forth her shoots to the sea,
\q2 and her branches as far as the River.
\q
\v 12 Why have you torn down her fences, and left her
\q2 to be plucked at by all who pass by,
\q
\v 13 to be gnawed by the boar from the forest,
\q2 and devoured by the beasts of the field?
\b
\q
\v 14 O God of hosts, return:
\q2 look down from heaven and see
\q and visit this vine, and restore her
\q2
\v 15 the vine which your right hand has planted.
\q
\v 16 She is burned with fire and cut down
\q2 before your stern face they are perishing.
\q
\v 17 Support the one you have chosen,
\q2 the one you have raised for yourself;
\q
\v 18 then from you we will never draw back.
\q2 Preserve us, and we will call on your name.
\q
\v 19 \nd Lord\nd*, God of hosts, restore us:
\q2 Show us the light of your face,

\q
\v 13 O that my people would listen,
\q2 that Israel would walk in my ways.
\q
\v 14 Soon would I humble their enemies,
\q2 and turn my hand on their foes.
\q
\v 15 Those who hate the \nd Lord\nd* would cringe before him

\q2 one generation after another.
\q
\v 2 Before the mountains were born,
\q2 or the earth and the world were brought forth,
\q from everlasting to everlasting
\q2 you are God.
\b
\q
\v 3 You bring [neut:us|masc:man] back to the dust,
\q2 you summon [neut:mortals|masc:men] to return.
\q
\v 4 For you see a thousand years
\q2 as the passing of yesterday,
\q2 as a watch in the night.
\b
\q
\v 5 Your floods sweep them away;
\q they are like a dream,
\q2 or like grass which sprouts in the morning,
\q
\v 6 which blossoms and sprouts in the morning,
\q2 but by evening is cut and withered.
\b
\q
\v 7 For your anger consumes us,
\q2 the heat of your wrath confounds us.
\q
\v 8 Our sins you have set before you,
\q2 our secrets in the light of your face.
\q
\v 9 For through your wrath our days are declining,
\q2 we bring our years to an end as a sigh.

\q
\v 10 The span of our life is seventy years,

\v 14 Grant us your love to the full in the morning,

\d A psalm. A song; for the sabbath day.
\q
\v 1 It is good to give thanks to the \nd Lord\nd*,
\q2 to sing praise to your name, O Most High,
\q
\v 2 to declare your love in the morning,
\q2 and your faithfulness in the night,
\q
\v 3 with voice and a ten-stringed harp,
\q2 with music that throbs on the lyre.
\q
\v 4 For you make me glad by your deeds, \nd Lord\nd*,
\q2 at the work of your hands I will ring out my joy.
\b
\q
\v 5 How great are your works, O \nd Lord\nd*;
\q2 how deep are your thoughts!
\q
\v 6 The insensitive cannot know,
\q2 nor can a fool understand,
\q
\v 7 that, though [neut:the wicked|masc:wicked men] flourish like grass,
\q2 and evil-doers all blossom,
\q2 they will perish forever.
\b
\q
\v 8 But you are exalted forever.
\q
\v 9 For see! Your enemies, \nd Lord\nd*
\q2 For see! Your enemies perish,
\q2 all evil-doers are scattered.
\q
\v 10 But you lift me to [us:honor|cth:honour],
\q2 and anoint me afresh with oil.
\q
\v 11 My eyes will feast on my foes,
\q2 and my ears will hear of the doom of the wicked.
\b
\q
\v 12 The righteous will sprout like the palm,
\q2 [neut:|masc:he] will grow like a cedar of Lebanon.
\q
\v 13 In the house of the \nd Lord\nd* are they planted,
\q2 in the courts of our God they will sprout.
\q
\v 14 They will still bear fruit in old age,

\b
\q
\v 3 The floods, O \nd Lord\nd*, have lifted,

\q
\v 1 \nd Lord\nd*, God of vengeance,

\q
\v 2 Rise up, judge of the earth,
\q2 pay back the proud what they deserve.
\b
\q
\v 3 \nd Lord\nd*, how long shall the wicked,
\q2 how long shall the wicked exult,
\q
\v 4 with their blustering arrogant words,
\q2 their braggart and wicked speech,
\q
\v 5 crushing your people, \nd Lord\nd*,
\q2 and afflicting your heritage,
\q
\v 6 murdering widows and strangers,
\q2 slaying the fatherless?
\q
\v 7 They think that the \nd Lord\nd* does not see,
\q2 nor the God of Jacob regard it.
\b
\q
\v 8 Take heed, you dullest of people;
\q2 when will you be wise, you fools?
\q
\v 9 Is he deaf, who shaped the ear?
\q2 Is he blind, who fashioned the eye?
\q
\v 10 Can he who trains nations not punish them
\q2 he who teaches knowledge to [neut:people|masc:men]?
\q
\v 11 The \nd Lord\nd* knows the thoughts of [neut:people|masc:men],
\q2 that only a breath are they.
\b
\q
\v 12 Happy [neut:are those|masc:the man] whom you chasten,
\q2 and teach out of your law,
\q
\v 13 keeping [neut:them|masc:him] calm in the day of misfortune,
\q2 till a pit be dug for the wicked.
\b
\q
\v 14 For the \nd Lord\nd* will not leave his people,
\q2 he will not forsake his inheritance.
\q
\v 15 For the righteous shall come to their rights,
\q2 and all true-hearted [neut:people|masc:men] shall follow them.
\b
\q
\v 16 Who will rise up for me against [neut:those|masc:men] who do evil?
\q2 Who will stand up for me against workers of wrong?
\q
\v 17 Were it not for the help of the \nd Lord\nd*,
\q2 I would soon have gone to the silent grave.
\q
\v 18 When I thought that my foot was slipping,
\q2 your kindness, \nd Lord\nd*, held me up.
\q
\v 19 When with cares my heart was crowded,
\q2 your comforts make me glad.
\b
\q
\v 20 Can corrupt justice be your ally,
\q2 framing mischief by statute?
\q
\v 21 They assail the life of the righteous,
\q2 and innocent blood condemn.
\q
\v 22 But the \nd Lord\nd* is my sure retreat,
\q2 my God is the rock of my refuge.
\q
\v 23 He will bring back their sin upon them,
\q2 for their wickedness he will destroy them;
\q2 the \nd Lord\nd* our God will destroy them.

\b
\q
\v 10 “For forty years I was filled with loathing
\q2 for that generation, so I said:

\v 8 All the day wild foes revile me,
\q2 using my name for a curse.
\b
\q
\v 9 For ashes have been my bread,
\q2 and tears have been mixed with my cup.
\q
\v 10 Because of your passionate anger,
\q2 you did raise me, then hurl me to the ground.
\q
\v 11 My days come to an end, shadows lengthen,

\q

\v 13 As a father pities his children,

\q2
\v 2 covered with robe of light.
\q You stretch out the heavens like the cloth of a tent.
\q2
\v 3 He lays the beams of his chambers on water.
\q He takes dark clouds for his chariot,

\q
\v 4 He takes the winds for his messengers,
\q2 the fire and the flame for his servants.
\b
\q

\q
\v 6 With the garment of ocean he covered it,
\q2 waters towered over the mountains.
\q
\v 7 But at your rebuke they fled,
\q2 scared by the roar of your thunder,
\q
\v 8 mountains rose, valleys sank down
\q2 to the place appointed for them.
\q
\v 9 They dared not pass the bounds set for them,
\q2 or cover the earth any more.
\b
\q
\v 10 He sent brooks into the valleys,
\q2 they meander between the mountains.
\q
\v 11 The wild beasts all drink from them,
\q2 and the wild asses quench their thirst.
\q
\v 12 The birds have their home by the banks,
\q2 and sing in the branches.
\q
\v 13 From his chambers above he gives drink to the mountains,
\q2 and satisfies earth with the vials of heaven.
\b
\q
\v 14 He makes grass grow for the cattle,
\q2 and herbs for [neut:people|masc:the servants of man].

\v 17 where the little birds build their nest,
\q2 and the stork whose home is the cypress.
\q
\v 18 The high hills are for the wild goats,
\q2 and the rocks are for coneys to hide in.
\b
\q
\v 19 He created the moon to mark seasons,
\q2 and told the sun when to set.
\q
\v 20 You make it dark: night comes,

\q
\v 21 Young lions that roar for their prey,

\v 25 And there is the great broad sea,
\q2 where are countless things in motion,
\q2 living creatures, both great and small.
\q
\v 26 There go the ships,
\q2 and the Leviathan you made to play there.
\b
\q
\v 27 They all look in hope to you,
\q2 to give them their food in due season.
\q
\v 28 And you give with open hand;
\q2 they gather and eat to their heart's desire.
\q
\v 29 When you hide your face, they are terrified;
\q2 when you take their breath away,
\q2 they die and go back to their dust.
\q
\v 30 But a breath from your lips creates them,
\q2 and renews the face of the earth.
\b
\q
\v 31 May the glory of the \nd Lord\nd* be forever,
\q2 may the \nd Lord\nd* rejoice in his works.
\q
\v 32 A glance of his makes the earth tremble,
\q2 a touch of his makes the hills smoke.
\q
\v 33 I will sing to the \nd Lord\nd* while I live,
\q2 I will play to my God while I am.
\q
\v 34 May my musing be sweet to him.
\q2 for I rejoice in the \nd Lord\nd*.
\q
\v 35 But may sinners be swept from the earth,
\q2 and the wicked vanish forever.
\q2 O my soul, bless the \nd Lord\nd*.
\q3 Hallelujah.

\s Psalm 105 – The Inspiration of the Past
\q
\v 1 Give thanks to the \nd Lord\nd*, call on his name:
\q2 make known his deeds among the nations.
\q
\v 2 Sing to him, make music to him,
\q2 tell of all his wondrous works.
\q
\v 3 Make your boast in his holy name,
\q2 be glad at heart, you who seek the \nd Lord\nd*.
\q
\v 4 Seek after the \nd Lord\nd* and his strength,
\q2 seek his face evermore.
\q
\v 5 Remember the wonders he did,
\q2 his portents, the judgments he uttered,
\q
\v 6 you who are offspring of Abraham, his servant,
\q2 the children of Jacob, his chosen ones.
\b
\q
\v 7 He is the \nd Lord\nd* our God:
\q2 in all the earth are his judgments.
\q
\v 8 He remembers forever his covenant,
\q2 his promise for a thousand generations
\q
\v 9 The covenant he made with Abraham,
\q2 the oath he swore to Isaac,
\q
\v 10 and confirmed as a statute to Jacob,
\q2 a pact everlasting to Israel
\q
\v 11 to give them the land of Canaan
\q2 as the lot which they should inherit.
\b
\q
\v 12 And when they were very few,
\q2 few and but pilgrims therein,
\q
\v 13 wandering from nation to nation,
\q2 journeying from people to people,
\q
\v 14 he allowed no [neut:one|masc:man] to oppress them,
\q2 even punishing kings for their sakes.
\q
\v 15 He forbade them to touch his anointed,
\q2 or do any hurt to his prophets.
\b
\q
\v 16 When he called down famine on the land,
\q2 and cut off the bread which sustained them,
\q
\v 17 he sent before them a man,
\q2 Joseph, who was sold as a slave.
\q
\v 18 His feet were galled with fetters,
\q2 he was laid in chains of iron,
\q
\v 19 till the time that his word came to pass,
\q2 the word of the \nd Lord\nd* that had tried him.
\b
\q
\v 20 The king sent and freed him,
\q2 the ruler of nations released him.
\q
\v 21 He made him lord of his household,
\q2 and ruler of all his possessions,
\q
\v 22 to admonish his princes at will
\q2 and instruct his elders in wisdom.
\b
\q
\v 23 Thus Israel came into Egypt,
\q2 Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham.
\q
\v 24 His people he made very fruitful,
\q2 and mightier than their foes.
\q
\v 25 He inspired them to hate his people,
\q2 and to deal with his servants craftily.
\b
\q
\v 26 He sent his servant Moses,
\q2 and Aaron whom he had chosen,
\q
\v 27 portents he wrought in Egypt,
\q2 and signs in the land of Ham.
\q
\v 28 Darkness he sent, and it fell:
\q2 yet they gave no heed to his word.
\b
\q
\v 29 He turned their waters into blood,
\q2 thus causing their fish to die.
\q
\v 30 Their land was alive with frogs,
\q2 swarming even in the royal chambers.
\q
\v 31 At his command came flies,
\q2 and lice in all their borders.
\q
\v 32 He gave them hail for rain
\q2 and fire that flashed through the land,
\q
\v 33 smiting their vines and figs,
\q2 breaking the trees of their border.
\b
\q
\v 34 At his command came locusts,
\q2 young locusts beyond all counting,
\q
\v 35 which ate every herb in the land,
\q2 ate up, too, the fruit of their ground.
\q
\v 36 He struck down in their land all the first-born,
\q2 the firstlings of all their strength
\q
\v 37 Then forth he led Israel with silver and gold,
\q2 and among his tribes [neut:no one|masc:not a man] was weary.
\b
\q
\v 38 Egypt was glad when they left,
\q2 for terror had fallen upon them.
\q
\v 39 He spread out a cloud to screen them,
\q2 and fire to give light in the night.
\q
\v 40 He sent quails at their entreaty,
\q2 and heavenly bread in abundance.
\q
\v 41 He opened the rock; waters gushed:
\q2 in the desert they ran like a river.
\q
\v 42 For he remembered his holy promise
\q2 to Abraham his servant.
\b
\q
\v 43 So he led out his people with joy,
\q2 his elect with a ringing cry.
\q
\v 44 And he gave them the lands of the nations,
\q2 the fruit of their toil for possession,
\q
\v 45 that so they might keep his statutes,
\q2 and be of his laws observant.
\q3 Hallelujah.

\s Psalm 106 – The Nation's Sin against the Lord
\q3
\v 1 Hallelujah!
\q Give thanks to the \nd Lord\nd* for his goodness,
\q2 for his kindness endures forever.
\q
\v 2 Who can describe his heroic deeds,
\q2 or publish all his praise?
\q
\v 3 Happy they who act justly,
\q2 and do righteousness evermore.
\b
\q
\v 4 Remember me, \nd Lord\nd*, as you remember your people,
\q2 and visit me with your gracious help.
\q
\v 5 May I see the good fortune of your elect,
\q2 may I share in the joy of your nation,
\q2 and in the pride of your heritage.
\b
\q
\v 6 We, like our fathers, have sinned,
\q2 we have done perversely and wickedly
\q
\v 7 In the land of Egypt our fathers,
\q2 all heedless of your wonders,
\q and unmindful of your great kindness,
\q2 at the Red Sea defied the Most High.
\q
\v 8 But true to his name he saved them,
\q2 in order to show his might.
\q
\v 9 He rebuked the Red Sea, and it dried;
\q2 they marched through the depths as through desert,
\q
\v 10 saved from the hand of the hostile,
\q2 redeemed from the hand of the foe.
\q
\v 11 The waters covered their enemies:
\q2 not [neut:one|masc:a man] of them was left.
\q
\v 12 So then they believed in his words,
\q2 and began to sing his praise.
\b
\q
\v 13 But soon they forgot his deeds:
\q2 they did not wait for his counsel.
\q
\v 14 Their greed was ravenous in the desert;
\q2 they put God to the test in the wilderness.
\q
\v 15 He gave them the thing they had asked for,
\q2 but sent wasting disease among them.
\b
\q
\v 16 The camp grew jealous of Moses
\q2 and of Aaron, holy one of the \nd Lord\nd*.
\q
\v 17 The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan,
\q2 and covered Abiram's company.
\q
\v 18 Fire broke out on their company,
\q2 flame kindled upon the wicked.
\b
\q
\v 19 They made a calf in Horeb,
\q2 and bowed to the molten image.
\q
\v 20 They exchanged their glorious God
\q2 for the image of ox that eats grass.
\q
\v 21 They forgot the God who had saved them
\q2 by mighty deeds in Egypt
\q
\v 22 Wonders in the land of Ham,
\q2 terrors by the Red Sea.
\q
\v 23 So he vowed, and would have destroyed them,
\q2 but for Moses his elect,
\q who stepped into the breach before him,
\q2 to divert his deadly wrath.
\b
\q
\v 24 They spurned the delightsome land,
\q2 they refused to believe in his word.
\q
\v 25 They grumbled in their tents,
\q2 would not listen to the voice of the \nd Lord\nd*.
\q
\v 26 So he swore with uplifted hand
\q2 to lay them low in the wilderness;
\q
\v 27 to disperse their seed among heathen,
\q2 to scatter them over the world.
\b
\q
\v 28 Then they joined them to Baal of Peor,
\q2 and ate what was offered the dead.
\q
\v 29 They provoked him to wrath by their deeds,
\q2 and plague broke out among them.
\q
\v 30 Then Phinehas stood between,
\q2 and so the plague was stayed;
\q
\v 31 and it was counted to him for righteousness
\q2 unto all generations forever.
\b
\q
\v 32 They angered him at the waters of Meribah,
\q2 through them it went ill with Moses.
\q
\v 33 They rebelled against his spirit,
\q2 and he uttered speech that was rash.
\b
\q
\v 34 They did not destroy the nations,
\q as the \nd Lord\nd* had commanded them;
\q2
\v 35 but they mingled with the heathen,
\q and learned to do as they did.
\q2
\v 36 Their idol gods they worshipped,
\q and they were ensnared by them.
\q2
\v 37 They sacrificed their sons
\q and their daughters to the demons.
\q2
\v 38 They poured out innocent blood
\q the blood of their sons and daughters
\q2 whom they offered to Canaan's idols,
\q and the land was polluted with blood.
\q2
\v 39 They became unclean by their works,
\q and adulterous in their deeds.
\q2
\v 40 Then the \nd Lord\nd*'s fury was on his people,
\q filled with horror at his inheritance.
\q2
\v 41 He delivered them to the heathen,
\q to the sway of those who hated them.
\q2
\v 42 Their enemies oppressed them,
\q and subdued them under their hand.
\q2
\v 43 Many a time he saved them,
\q but they rebelled at his counsel,
\q2 and were brought low by their wrongdoing.
\q
\v 44 Yet he looked upon their distress,
\q2 when he heard their cry.
\q
\v 45 He remembered his covenant,
\q2 and, in his great kindness, relented.
\q
\v 46 He caused them to be pitied
\q2 by all who carried them captive.
\b
\q
\v 47 Save us, O \nd Lord\nd* our God,
\q2 and gather us out of the nations,
\q to give thanks to your holy name,
\q2 and to make our boast of your praise.

\s Psalm 107 – The Song of the Redeemed
\q
\v 1 Give thanks to the \nd Lord\nd* for his goodness
\q2 for his kindness endures forever.
\q
\v 2 Let this be the song of the ransomed,
\q2 whom the \nd Lord\nd* has redeemed from distress,
\q
\v 3 gathering them from all lands,
\q2 east, west, north, and south.
\b
\q
\v 4 In the wastes of the desert some wandered,
\q2 finding no way to a city inhabited.
\q
\v 5 Full of hunger and thirst,
\q2 their spirit failed.
\q
\v 6 Then they cried to the \nd Lord\nd* in their trouble,
\q2 and he saved them from their distresses,
\q
\v 7 guiding them straight on the way,
\q2 till they reached an inhabited city.
\q
\v 8 Let them thank the \nd Lord\nd* for his kindness,
\q2 for his wonderful deeds for [neut:people|masc:men];
\q
\v 9 for the thirsty he satisfies,
\q2 and the hungry he fills with good things.
\b
\q
\v 10 Some sat in darkness and gloom
\q2 prisoners in irons and misery,
\q
\v 11 for rebelling against God's word,
\q2 and spurning the Most High's counsel.
\q
\v 12 Their heart was bowed with toil;
\q2 there was no one to help when they stumbled.
\q
\v 13 Then they cried to the \nd Lord\nd* in their trouble,
\q2 and he saved them from their distresses.
\q
\v 14 Out of darkness and gloom he brought them,
\q2 and burst their chains.
\q
\v 15 Let them praise the \nd Lord\nd* for his kindness,
\q2 for his wonderful deeds for [neut:people|masc:men].
\q
\v 16 For he shattered the gates of bronze,
\q2 and broke bars of iron.
\b
\q
\v 17 Some were sick from their wicked ways,
\q2 and suffering because of their sins.
\q
\v 18 All manner of food they hated;
\q2 they had come to the gates of death.
\q
\v 19 Then they cried to the \nd Lord\nd* in their trouble,
\q2 and he saved them from their distresses.
\q
\v 20 He sent his word and healed them,
\q2 and delivered their life from the pit.
\q
\v 21 Let them praise the \nd Lord\nd* for his kindness,
\q2 for his wonderful deeds for [neut:people|masc:men].
\q
\v 22 Let them offer to him thankofferings,
\q2 and with joy tell what things he has done.
\b
\q
\v 23 Some crossed the sea in ships,
\q2 doing business in great waters.
\q
\v 24 They have seen what the \nd Lord\nd* can do,
\q2 and his wonderful deeds on the deep.
\q
\v 25 At his command rose a tempest,
\q2 which lifted the waves on high.
\q
\v 26 Up to heaven they went, down to the depths;
\q2 their courage failed them.
\q
\v 27 They staggered and reeled like drunkards;
\q2 all their skills useless.
\q
\v 28 Then they cried to the \nd Lord\nd* in their trouble,
\q2 and he saved them from their distresses.
\q
\v 29 He stilled the storm to a whisper,
\q2 and the waves of the sea were hushed.
\q
\v 30 They were glad, because it was quiet;
\q2 they were led to the haven they longed for.
\q
\v 31 Let them praise the \nd Lord\nd*, for his kindness,
\q2 for his wonderful deeds for [neut:people|masc:men].
\q
\v 32 Where the people assemble, extol him,
\q2 and praise him in council of elders.
\b
\q
\v 33 He turns streams into a wilderness,
\q2 springs of water into thirsty land,
\q
\v 34 fruitful land into a salt waste,
\q2 because of the sin of the people.
\q
\v 35 A desert he makes pools of water,
\q2 a land of drought into springs of water.
\q
\v 36 He settles the hungry therein,
\q2 they establish a city to live in.
\q
\v 37 They sow fields and plant vineyards,
\q2 which furnish a fruitful yield.
\q
\v 38 By his blessing they multiply greatly,
\q2 and he lets not their cattle decrease.
\b
\q
\v 39 Yet when they are bowed and diminished
\q2 by oppression, misfortune, or sorrow,
\q
\v 40 he pours contempt upon princes,
\q2 and on trackless wastes leads them astray
\q
\v 41 He lifts the poor out of misery,
\q2 and makes families fruitful as flocks.
\q
\v 42 At this sight shall the upright be glad,
\q2 and all wicked mouths shall be stopped.
\q
\v 43 Let [neut:those who are|masc:the man who is] wise observe this,
\q2 and consider the love of the \nd Lord\nd*

\v 2 Awake, harp and lyre;

\q
\v 6 So those you love may be rescued,

\rem Revision 2
\q
\v 1 When Israel went out of Egypt,
\q2 Jacob's house from a barbarous people,
\q
\v 2 God chose Judah for himself,
\q2 Israel became his kingdom.
\b
\q
\v 3 The sea saw it, and fled,
\q2 Jordan river ran backwards.
\q
\v 4 Mountains skipped like rams,
\q2 hills like the young of the flock.
\b
\q
\v 5 Why, sea, do you flee?
\q2 Jordan, why run backwards?
\q
\v 6 Mountains, why skip ram-like?
\q2 Why, hills, like the young of the flock?
\b
\q
\v 7 Earth, tremble before the \nd Lord\nd*,
\q2 at the presence of Jacob's God,
\q
\v 8 who turns rocks into pools of water,
\q2 and flint into fountains of water.

\s Psalm 115 – Israel's Incomparable God
\q
\v 1 Not to us, \nd Lord\nd*, not to us,
\q2 but to your name give glory,
\q2 for your kindness' and faithfulness' sake.
\q
\v 2 Why should the heathen say,
\q2 “Where is now their God?”
\q
\v 3 Our God he is in heaven;
\q2 whatever he wishes, he does.
\q
\v 4 Their idols are silver and gold,
\q2 made by human hands.
\q
\v 5 They have mouths, but cannot speak;
\q2 they have eyes, but cannot see.
\q
\v 6 They have ears, but cannot hear;
\q2 they have noses, but cannot smell.
\q
\v 7 They have hands, but cannot feel;
\q2 they have feet, but cannot walk:
\q2 no sound comes from their throats.
\q
\v 8 Their makers become like them,
\q2 so do all who trust in them.
\b
\q
\v 9 O Israel, trust in the \nd Lord\nd*:
\q2 he is their help and their shield.
\q
\v 10 House of Aaron, trust in the \nd Lord\nd*:
\q2 he is their help and their shield.
\q
\v 11 You who fear the \nd Lord\nd*, trust in the \nd Lord\nd*
\q2 he is their help and their shield.
\b
\q
\v 12 The \nd Lord\nd*, mindful of us, will bless us:
\q2 he will bless the house of Israel,
\q2 he will bless the house of Aaron.
\q
\v 13 He will bless those who fear the \nd Lord\nd*,
\q2 the small and the great together.
\b
\q
\v 14 May the \nd Lord\nd* add to your numbers
\q2 to you and to your children.

\q2 creator of heaven and earth.
\b
\q
\v 16 The heavens are the heavens of the \nd Lord\nd*,

\q
\v 17 The dead cannot praise the \nd Lord\nd*,

\q
\v 18 But we will bless the \nd Lord\nd*
\q2 from now and for evermore.

\s Psalm 116 – Song of Thanksgiving for Deliverance
\q
\v 1 I love the \nd Lord\nd*, for he hears
\q2 my voice, my pleas for mercy.
\q
\v 2 For he has inclined his ear to me:
\q2 I will call upon him as long as I live.
\b
\q
\v 3 About me were snares of death,
\q2 the anguish of Sheol was upon me:
\q2 distress and sorrow were mine.
\q
\v 4 Then I called on the name of the \nd Lord\nd*:
\q2 “I beseech you, O \nd Lord\nd*, deliver me.”
\b
\q
\v 5 Gracious and just is the \nd Lord\nd*,
\q2 compassionate is our God.
\q
\v 6 The \nd Lord\nd* preserves the simple;
\q2 when I was drooping, he saved me.
\q
\v 7 Be at peace, my heart, once more,
\q2 for the \nd Lord\nd* has been good to you.
\b
\q
\v 8 You have rescued me from death,
\q2 my eyes from tears,
\q2 my feet from stumbling.
\q
\v 9 Before the \nd Lord\nd* I will walk
\q2 in the land of the living.
\b
\q
\v 10 I held fast my faith, though I said,
\q2 “Ah me! I am sore afflicted,”
\q
\v 11 though in my alarm I said,
\q2 “Everyone is a liar.”
\b
\q
\v 12 What shall I render the \nd Lord\nd*
\q2 for all his bounty to me?
\q
\v 13 I will lift up the cup of salvation,
\q2 and call on the name of the \nd Lord\nd*.
\q
\v 14 I will pay my vows to the \nd Lord\nd*
\q2 in the presence of all his people.
\b
\q
\v 15 Grave in the eyes of the \nd Lord\nd*
\q2 is the death of his loyal and loved ones.
\q
\v 16 Ah, \nd Lord\nd*! I am your servant,
\q2 your servant, [neut:child|masc:the son] of your handmaid.
\q2 You have loosened my bonds.
\b
\q

\q2 What can [neut:mere people|masc:man] do to me?
\q
\v 7 The \nd Lord\nd* is mine, as my help:

\q2 than to trust in [neut:mortals|masc:mortal men].
\q
\v 9 It is better to hide in the \nd Lord\nd*
\q2 than to put any trust in princes.

\q
\v 11 They swarmed, swarmed around me;
\q2 in the name of the \nd Lord\nd* I cut them down,
\q
\v 12 they swarmed around me like bees,
\q2 they blazed like a fire of thorns:
\q2 in the name of the \nd Lord\nd* I cut them down.
\b
\q
\v 13 Sore they pushed me, to make me fall;
\q2 but the \nd Lord\nd* gave me his help.

\d Of David.
\q
\v 1 I will thank you, O \nd Lord\nd*, with all my heart:
\q2 in the sight of the gods I will sing your praise,
\q
\v 2 and prostrate before your holy temple,
\q2 will praise your name for your constant love,
\q2 for you have exulted your promise above all.
\b
\q
\v 3 When I called you, you answered;
\q2 you gave me strength, you inspired me.
\q
\v 4 All the kings of the earth shall praise you, O \nd Lord\nd*,
\q2 when they shall have heard the words you have uttered;
\q
\v 5 and they shall sing of the ways of the \nd Lord\nd*,
\q2 and tell of the \nd Lord\nd*'s transcendent glory.
\q
\v 6 For, high though the \nd Lord\nd* is, he looks on the lowly,
\q2 and strikes down the haughty from far away.
\b
\q
\v 7 Though my way be distressful, yet you preserve me:
\q2 you lay your hand on my angry foes,
\q2 and your right hand gives me victory.
\q
\v 8 The \nd Lord\nd* will accomplish all that which concerns me.
\q2 Your kindness, O \nd Lord\nd*, endures forever.
\q2 O do not abandon the work of your hands.

\s Psalm 139 – The Ever-Present God
\d For the leader. Of David, a psalm.
\q
\v 1 O \nd Lord\nd*, you search and know me;
\q2
\v 2 when I sit, when I rise you know it,
\q you perceive my thoughts from afar.
\b
\q
\v 3 When I walk, when I lie you sift it,
\q2 familiar with all my ways.
\q
\v 4 There is not a word on my tongue,
\q2 but see! \nd Lord\nd*, you know it all.
\b
\q
\v 5 Behind and before you beset me,
\q2 upon me you lay your hand.
\q
\v 6 It's too wonderful for me to know
\q2 too lofty I cannot attain it.
\b
\q
\v 7 Whither shall I go from your spirit?
\q2 Or whither shall I flee from your face?
\q
\v 8 If I climb up to heaven, you are there:
\q2 or make Sheol my bed, you are there.
\b
\q
\v 9 If I lift up the wings of the morning
\q2 and fly to the end of the sea,
\q
\v 10 there also your hand would grasp me,
\q2 and your right hand take hold of me.
\b
\q
\v 11 If I say, “Let the darkness cover me,
\q2 and night be the light about me,”
\q
\v 12 The dark is not dark for you,
\q2 but night is as light as the day.
\b
\q
\v 13 For you did put me together;
\q2 in my mother's womb you did weave me.
\q
\v 14 I give you praise for my fashioning
\q2 so full of awe, so wonderful.
\q2 Your works are wonderful.
\b
\q You knew me right well;
\q2
\v 15 my bones were not hidden from you,
\q when I was made in secret,
\q2 and woven in the depths of the earth.
\b
\q
\v 16 Your eyes saw all my days:
\q2 they stood on your book every one
\q written down, before they were fashioned,
\q2 while none of them yet was mine.
\b
\q
\v 17 But how far, O God, beyond measure
\q2 are your thoughts! How mighty their sum!
\q
\v 18 Should I count, they are more than the sand.
\q2 When I wake, I am still with you.
\b
\q
\v 19 Will you slay the wicked, O God?
\q2 And remove from me [neut:the bloodthirsty|masc:men of blood],
\q
\v 20 who maliciously defy you
\q2 and take your name in vain.
\b
\q
\v 21 Do I not hate those who hate you, \nd Lord\nd*?
\q2 Do I not loathe those who resist you?
\q
\v 22 With perfect hatred I hate them,
\q2 I count them my enemies.
\b
\q
\v 23 Search me, O God, know my heart:
\q2 test me, and know my thoughts,
\q
\v 24 and see if guile be in me;
\q2 and lead me in the way everlasting.

\q2 from the [neut:violent|masc:man of violence] guard me
\q
\v 2 from those who plot evil in their heart,

\q
\v 3 who make their tongue as sharp as a serpent's,

\b
\q
\v 4 Preserve me, O \nd Lord\nd*, from the hands of the wicked,
\q2 from the [neut:violent|masc:man of violence] guard me
\q2 from those who are plotting to trip up my feet.
\q
\v 5 The proud have hidden a trap for me,
\q2 cords they have spread as a net for my feet:
\q2 snares they have set at the side of my track. \qs Selah\qs*
\b
\q
\v 6 I have said to the \nd Lord\nd*, “My God are you;
\q2 give ear, \nd Lord\nd*, to my loud plea.
\q
\v 7 O \nd Lord\nd* my \nd Lord\nd*, my [us:savior|cth:saviour] mighty,
\q2 you did cover my head in the day of battle.
\q
\v 8 Grant not, O \nd Lord\nd*, the desires of the wicked;
\q2 and what they have purposed, promote you not.” \qs Selah\qs*
\b
\q
\v 9 Let them not lift up their heads against me.
\q2 May the mischief they prate bring themselves to destruction,
\q
\v 10 may he rain upon them coals of fire,
\q2 may he strike them down swiftly, to rise no more,
\q
\v 11 no place in the land may there be for the slanderer:
\q2 may the violent be hunted from sorrow to sorrow.
\b
\q
\v 12 I know that the \nd Lord\nd* will do right by the weak,
\q2 and will execute justice for those who are needy.
\q
\v 13 Surely the righteous shall praise your name,
\q2 and they who are upright shall live in your presence.

\q
\v 2 Let my prayer be presented as incense before you,
\q2 and my uplifted hands as the evening meal-offering.
\b
\q
\v 3 Set, O \nd Lord\nd*, a watch on my mouth,
\q2 put a guard on the door of my lips.
\q
\v 4 Incline not my heart to an evil matter,
\q2 to busy myself in deeds of wickedness,
\q in company with workers of evil:
\q2 never may I partake of their dainties.
\b
\q
\v 5 A wound or reproof from a good [neut:person|masc:man] in kindness
\q2 is oil which my head shall never refuse.
\q2 In their misfortune my prayer is still with them.
\b
\q
\v 6 Abandoned they are to the hands of their judges:
\q2 they shall learn that my words are true.
\b
\q
\v 7 Like stones on a country road cleft and broken
\q2 so lie our bones scattered for Death to devour.
\q
\v 8 But my eyes are turned towards you, O \nd Lord\nd*.
\q2 Do not pour out my life, for in you I take refuge.
\q
\v 9 Keep me safe from the trap they have laid for me,
\q2 from the snares of the workers of trouble.

\q2 to the \nd Lord\nd* plead loudly for mercy,
\q
\v 2 I pour my complaint before him,
\q2 I tell my troubles to him.
\b
\q
\v 3 When my spirit is faint within me,
\q2 my path is known to you.
\q In the way I am wont to walk in,
\q2 they have hidden a trap for me.
\b
\q
\v 4 I look to the right and the left;
\q2 but not a friend have I.
\q No place of refuge is left me,
\q2 not a man to care for me.
\b
\q
\v 5 So I cry to you, O \nd Lord\nd*:
\q2 I say, “My refuge are you,
\q2 all I have in the land of the living.”
\b
\q
\v 6 Attend to my piercing cry,
\q2 for very weak am I.
\q Save me from those who pursue me,

\v 2 With your servant O enter you not into judgment,

\v 7 Answer me soon, \nd Lord\nd*,

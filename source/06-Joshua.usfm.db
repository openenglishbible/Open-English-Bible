\v 1 Now it came to pass after the death of Moses, the servant of Jehovah, that Jehovah said to Joshua the son of Nun, the attendant of Moses,
\v 2 'Moses my servant is dead; now arise, go over this Jordan with all this people to the land which I am about to give to the Israelites.
\v 3 Every place upon which the sole of thy foot shall tread, to thee will I give it, as I promised Moses.
\v 4 From the wilderness and this Lebanon, even to the great river, the river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, and as far as the Great Sea toward the setting sun shall be your boundary.
\v 5 No one shall be able to stand against thee all the days of thy life; as I was with Moses so I will be with thee; I will not fail thee nor forsake thee.
\v 6 Be courageous and strong; for thou shall bring this people into possession of the land which I swore to their fathers to give them.
\v 7 Only be very courageous and strong, to observe faithfully all the law which Moses my servant commanded thee; do not turn from it to the right hand or to the left, that thou may have success wherever thou go.
\v 8 This law-book shall not depart out of thy mouth, but thou shall meditate on it day and night, that thou may observe faithfully all that is written in it; for then thou shall make thy way prosperous, and shall have success.
\v 9 Have I not commanded thee? Be courageous and strong! Fear not, neither be dismayed, for Jehovah thy God is with thee wherever thou go.'
\v 10 Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people saying,
\v 11 Pass through the midst of the camp and command the people saying, 'Prepare provisions for yourselves, for within three days you are to pass over this Jordan to go in to possess the land which Jehovah your God is giving you as a possession.'
\v 12 Also to the Reubcnites and the Gadites and the half-tribe of Manasseh Joshua said,
\v 13 Remember the command which Moses the servant of Jehovah gave you, when he said, 'Jehovah your God is about to bring you to a settled abode and will give you this land.'
\v 14 Your wives and your little ones and your cattle shall remain in the land which Moses gave you; but you – as many of you as are able to fight – shall pass over armed before your kinsmen and shall help them,
\v 15 until Jehovah hath given a settled abode to your kinsmen as to you and they also have taken possession of the land which Jehovah your God is about to give them. Then you shall return to the land of your possession, which Moses the servant of Jehovah gave you beyond the Jordan toward the rising sun.
\v 16 And they answered Joshua saying. All that you have commanded us we will do, and wherever you send us we will go.
\v 17 As we obeyed Moses in all things, so will we obey you. Only may Jehovah your God be with you, as he was with Moses.
\v 18 Any one who shall rebel against your command and shall not obey your words in all that you command him, shall be put to death; only be courageous and strong.

\v 1 Then Joshua the son of Nun sent secretly from Shittim two men as spies, saying. Go view the land and especially Jericho. So they went and entered the house of a harlot whose name was Rahab, and lay down there.
\v 2 Now it was told the king of Jericho, saying, There came some men here tonight from the Israelites to explore the land.
\v 3 And the king of Jericho sent to Rahab saying. Bring forth the men who have come to you, for they have come to explore all the land.
\v 4 Now the woman had taken the two men and hidden them, and she said. It is true, some men came to me, but I did not know where they came from.
\v 5 When the time came to shut the gate at nightfall.
\v 6 She had, however, brought them up to the roof and hid them with the stalks of flax which she had laid in order upon the roof.
\v 7 Accordingly the men pursued them in the direction of the Jordan opposite the fords, and as soon as they that pursued after them had gone out, they shut the gate.
\v 8 But before they had lain down, she came up to them on the roof,
\v 9 and said to the men, I know that Jehovah has given you the land, and that terror because of you has fallen upon us, and that all the inhabitants of the land are losing heart before you.
\v 10 For we have heard how Jehovah dried up the water of the Red Sea before you when you came out of Egypt, and what you did to the two kings of the Amorites that were beyond the Jordan, to Sihon and Og, whom you utterly destroyed.
\v 11 And as soon as we had heard it, we lost heart completely, neither did there remain any more spirit in any man because of you; for Jehovah yonr God is indeed God in heaven above and on earth beneath.
\v 12 Now therefore swear to me by Jehovah, since I have dealt kindly with you, that you will also deal kindly with my father's house, and give me a true token.
\v 13 But Rahab said to the men. Swear that you will save alive my father and my mother and my brothers, and my sisters, together with all that they have, and will deliver our lives from death.
\v 14 And the men said to her, We will be prepared to forfeit our lives for you, if you do not disclose this business of ours. It shall be, when Jehovah gives us the land, that we will deal kindly and truly with you.
\v 15 Then she let them down by a rope through the window (for her house was so close beside the city wall that she dwelt upon the wall).
\v 16 And she said to them. Go to the mountain, lest the pursuers happen to find you; and hide yourselves there three days until the pursuers have returned; and afterward you may go on your way.
\v 17 Then the men said to her. We will be free from this oath to you which you have made us swear.
\v 18 Behold, when we come into the land, you shall bind this cord of scarlet thread in the window through which you let us down and you shall gather to yourself into the house, your father and your mother and your brothers, and all your father's household.
\v 19 And it shall be, if anyone goes out of the doors of your house into the street, his blood shall be upon his head, and we shall be guiltless; but if any one stays with you in the house, his blood shall be on our heads, if an injury befalls him.
\v 20 But if you do disclose this business of ours, then we shall be free from the oath to which you have made us swear.
\v 21 And she said. Let it be as you say. So she sent them away, and they departed and she bound the scarlet cord in the window.
\v 22 So they went and came to the mountain, and remained there three days, until the pursuers had returned. Now the pursuers sought for them in every direction, but did not find them.
\v 23 Then the two men returned, descending from the mountain, and passed over and came to Joshua the son of Nun, and told him all that had befallen them.
\v 24 And they said to Joshua, Jehovah has delivered all the land into our power; and moreover all the inhabitants of the land have lost heart before us.

\v 1 Then Joshua rose up early in the morning and he and all the Israelites came t the Jodan and spent the night there before they moved over. Then they removed from Shittim.
\v 2 Now after three days the officers went through the midst of the camp
\v 3 and commanded the people saying, When you see the ark of the covenant of Jehovah your God and the priest, the Levites, bearing it, then you shall remove from your place and go after it.
\v 4 Yet there shall be a space between you and it of about two thousand cubits. Do not come near it, that you may know the way by which you must go; for you have never passed this way before.
\v 5 And Joshua said to the people, Sanctify yourselves, for tomorrow Jehovah will do wonderful things among you.
\v 6 And Joshua said to the priests, Take up the ark of the covenant and pass over before the people.
\v 7 Then Jehovah said to Joshus, This day will I begin to magnify thee in the sight of all Israel that they may know that I will be with thee as I was with Moses,
\v 8 and thou shall command the priests who bear the ark of the covenant, saying, When you come to the brink of the waters of Jordan, you shall stand still in the waters of Jordan.
\v 9 Joshua also said to the Israelites, Come hither and hear the words of Jehovah your God.
\v 10 Then Joshua said, By this you shall know that a living God is among you, and that he will certainly drive out from before you the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Hivites, the Perizzites, the Girgashites, the Amorites and the Jebusites.
\v 11 Behold, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth passes over before you into the Jordan.
\v 12 Also take twelve men from the people, one man from each tribe.
\v 13 And it shall come to pass when the soles of the feet of the priests that bear the ark of Jehovah the Lord of all the earth shall rest in the waters of Jordan, that the waters of Jordan shall be cut off, and they shall rise in a heap. And the waters that come down from above shall stand still.
\v 14 And it came to pass when the people removed from their tents to pass over the Jordan, the priests who were carrying the ark of the covenant being before the people, that Jehovah dried up the waters of the Jordan.
\v 15 And so when those who were crossing carrying the ark came to the Jordan – the Jordan overflows its banks all the time of harvest – therefore when the feet of the priests who were carrying the ark dipped in the brink of the water,
\v 16 the waters which came down from above stood still. Its waters rose up in a heap, a great way off at Adam, the city that is beside Zarethan, and those that went down toward the sea of the Arabah, the Salt Sea, were wholly cut off. And the people stood opposite Jericho.
\v 17 And the priests who were carrying the ark of the covenant of Jehovah stood firm on dry ground in the midst of the Jordan, while all Israel passed over on dry ground, until the whole nation had completed the crossing of the Jordan.
\c 4
\v 1 And it came to pass, when the whole nation had completed the crossing of the Jordan, that Jehovah said to Joshua,
\v 2 take twelve men from the people, one man from each tribe.
\v 3 Command them saying, Take hence from the midst of the Jordan, (out of the place where the priests' feet stood) twelve stones, and carry them over with you and lay them down in the camping-place, where you shall pass the night,
\v 4 Then Joshua called the twelve men whom he had appointed of the Israelites, a man from each tribe,
\v 5 and Joshua said to them, Pass over before the ark of Jehovah your God into the midst of the Jordan, and let every man of you lift a stone upon his shoulder, according to the number of the tribes of the Israelites;
\v 6 that this may be a sign among you, that, when your children ask in time to come, saying, "What do you mean by these stones?"
\v 7 then you shall say to them, "Because the waters of the Jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of Jehovah; when it passed over the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan were cut off." and these stones shall be for a memorial to the Israelites forever.
\v 8 And the Israelites did as Joshua commanded. They took up twelve stones out of the midst of the Jordan, as Jehovah said to Joshua, according to the number of the tribes of the Israelites, and they carried them over with them to the place where they camped, and laid them down there.
\v 9 Then Joshua set up twelve stones in the midst of the Jordan in the place where the feet of the priests who carried the ark of the covenant stood; and they are there to this day.
\v 10 The priests who carried the ark stood in the midst of the Jordan, until every thing was finished that Jehovah commanded Joshua to speak to the people according to all that Moses commanded Joshua. Then the people passed over quickly.
\v 11 And it came to pass when all the people had finished the passage, that the ark of Jehovah passed over and the priests, in the presence of the people.
\v 12 And the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh, passed over armed before the Israelites, as Moses commanded them;
\v 13 about forty thousand ready armed for war passed over before Jehovah to battle, to the plains of Jericho.
\v 14 On that day Jehovah magnified Joshua in the sight of all Israel; and they feared him as they feared Moses, all the days of his life.
\v 15 And Jehovah said to Joshua,
\v 16 Command the priests who carry the ark of the law, that they come up out of hte Jordan.
\v 17 Joshua therefore commanded the priests, saying, Come up out of the Jordan.
\v 18 And when the priests who were carrying the ark of the covenant of Jehovah came up from the midst of the Jordan, and the soles of the priests' feet were lifted up on the dry ground, the waters of the Jordan returned to their place and went over all its banks as before.
\v 19 So the people came up out of the Jordan on the tenth day of the first month, and encamped in Gilgal, on the east side of Jericho.

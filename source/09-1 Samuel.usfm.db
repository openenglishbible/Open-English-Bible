\h 1 Samuel
\mt The First Book of Samuel 

\c 1 

\v 1 Now there was a certain man of Ramah, a Zuphite of the hill country of Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephraimite. 

\v 2 He had two wives: the name of the one was Hannah, and the name of the other Peninnah; and Peninnah had children, but Hannah had none. 

\v 3 This man used to go up from his city year by year to worship and to sacrifice to the \nd Lord\nd* of armies in Shiloh. Eli and his two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, were priests to the \nd Lord\nd* there. 

\v 4 It came to pass on one occasion that Elkanah sacrificed. Now he used to give portions to Peninnah his wife and to all her sons and daughters, 

\v 5 but to Hannah he used to give one portion, although he loved Hannah; but the \nd Lord\nd* had shut up her womb. 

\v 6 Her rival used to vex her bitterly in order to make her angry, because the \nd Lord\nd* had shut up her womb. 

\v 7 Thus he did year by year, as often as she went up to the house of the \nd Lord\nd*, she used to vex her; therefore she wept and would not eat. 

\v 8 But Elkanah her husband said to her, “Hannah, why do you weep and not eat, and why is your heart sad? Am not I better to you than ten sons?”

\p

\v 9 So Hannah rose up, after they had eaten in Shiloh and stood before the \nd Lord\nd*. Now Eli the priest was sitting at his seat at the door-posts of the temple of the \nd Lord\nd*. 

\v 10 She was greatly distressed and prayed fervently to the \nd Lord\nd* and wept bitterly. 

\v 11 She vowed a vow, saying, 

\q O \nd Lord\nd* of armies!
\q If you will indeed look on the affliction of your maid-servant, 
\q remember me and not forget your maid-servant,
\q but will give to your maid-servant a boy
\q then I will give him to the \nd Lord\nd* all the days of his life.
\q A razor shall not come upon his head. 

\p

\v 12 While she continued praying before the \nd Lord\nd*, Eli observed her mouth. 

\v 13 Now Hannah was speaking to herself. Only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard; therefore Eli took her for a drunken woman. 

\v 14 So Eli said to her, “How long will you act like a drunken woman? Put away the effects of your wine and go from the presence of the \nd Lord\nd*.”

\p

\v 15 But Hannah answered and said, “No, my lord, an unfortunate woman am I; I have drunk neither wine nor intoxicating drink, but I have been pouring out my soul before the \nd Lord\nd*. 

\v 16 Do not take your maid-servant to be a vile woman, for because of the greatness of my grief and vexation have I continued speaking until now.” 

\p

\v 17 Then Eli answered and said. “Go in peace, and the God of Israel grant your petition that you have asked of him.“

\p

\v 18 She said, “Let your maid-servant find favor in your sight.” So the woman went her way and ate, and her countenance was no more sad. 

\p

\v 19 They rose up in the morning early, and worshipped before the \nd Lord\nd*, and returned and came to their house at Ramah. And Elkanah knew Hannah his wife; and the \nd Lord\nd* remembered her. 

\p

\v 20 And Hannah conceived, and it came to pass at the coming around of the new year that she bore a son, and called his name Samuel\f + Heb: Asked of God\f*, saying, “For I have asked him of the \nd Lord\nd*.” 

\p

\v 21 The man Elkanah and all his household went up to offer to the \nd Lord\nd* the yearly sacrifice and his vow. 

\v 22 But Hannah did not go up; for she said to her husband, “When the child is weaned then I will bring him and he shall appear in the presence of the \nd Lord\nd* and shall dwell there forever.”

\p

\v 23 Elkanah her husband said to her, “Do what seems good to you: wait until you have weaned him; only may the \nd Lord\nd* establish your word.”

\p So the woman waited and nursed her son until she weaned him. 

\v 24 When she had weaned him, she took him up with her, together with a three-year-old bullock and a bushel of flour and a skin of wine, and brought him to the house of the \nd Lord\nd* in Shiloh. 

\v 25 They slew the bullock and Hannah brought the lad to Eli. 

\v 26 She said, “Oh, sir, by your life, I am the woman who stood near you here, praying fervently to the \nd Lord\nd*. 

\v 27 This is the lad regarding whom I was fervently praying, and the \nd Lord\nd* has granted me my petition which I asked of him. 

\v 28 Now, I on my part have given him to the \nd Lord\nd*; as long as he lives he is given to the \nd Lord\nd*.” So she left him there before the \nd Lord\nd*.

\c 2 

\v 1 \p And Hannah prayed, and said:

\q My heart exults in the \nd Lord\n*,
\q my strength is exalted in the \nd Lord\n*;
\q my mouth laughs at my enemies;
\q because I rejoice in your salvation.
\b
\v 2 \q There is none holy as the \nd Lord\n*,
\q there is none like you;
\q there is no rock like our God.
\b
\v 3 \q Do not talk so proudly,
\q let not arrogance come out of your mouth,
\q for the \nd Lord\n* is a God of knowledge,
\q and by him actions are weighed.
\b
\v 4 \q The bows of the mighty men are broken,
\q and they that stumbled are girded with strength.
\v 5 \q They that were full have hired out themselves for bread,
\q and they that were hungry have ceased;
\q while the barren has borne seven,
\q she who had many children has languished.
\b
\v 6 \q The \nd Lord\n* kills, and makes alive;
\q he brings down to the grave, and brings up.
\v 7 \q The \nd Lord\n* makes poor, and makes rich;
\q he brings low, he also lifts up.
\v 8 \q He raises up the poor out of the dust,
\q he lifts up the needy from the garbage heap
\q to make them sit with princes,
\q and inherit the throne of glory.
\q For the pillars of the earth are the \nd Lord\n*’S,
\q and he has set the world upon them.
\b
\v 9 \q He will guard the feet of his holy ones,
\q but the wicked will be put to silence in darkness;
\q for not by strength will humans prevail.
\v 10 \q They who strive with the \nd Lord\n* will be broken to pieces;
\q against them will he thunder in heaven.
\q The \nd Lord\n* will judge the ends of the earth,
\q he will give strength to his king
\q and exalt the power of his anointed.

\v 11 So Elkanah went to Ramah. But the lad was ministering to the \nd Lord\nd* in the presence of Eli the priest. 

\v 12 Now the sons of Eli were base scoundrels; they had no regard for the \nd Lord\nd*, 

\v 13 nor for what was justly due to the priest from the people. Whenever a man offered a sacrifice, the priest's servant would come, while the meat was boiling, with a three-pronged fork in his hand, 

\v 14 and would strike into the pot or the kettle or the basin or the dish. All that the fork brought up the priest would take for himself. So they did to all the Israelites who came to sacrifice to the \nd Lord\nd* in Shiloh. 

\v 15 Moreover before they burned the fat, the priest's servant used to come and say to the man who was making the offering, <<Give me meat to roast for the priest; for he will not take from you boiled flesh, but raw.>>

\v 16 Should the man, however, say to him, <<First you should burn the fat, then take as much as you desire,>> he would reply, <<No, you must give it at once or else I will take it by force.>> 

\v 17 Thus the sin of the young men was very great before the \nd Lord\nd*; for the men had contempt for the offering of the \nd Lord\nd*. 

\v 18 And Samuel continued ministering before the \nd Lord\nd* — a lad girded with a linen ephod. 

\v 19 His mother used to make him a little robe and bring it to him from year to year, when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice. 

\v 20 And Eli would bless Elkanah and his wife and say, <<The \nd Lord\nd* repay you with offspring from this woman for the gift which she gave to the \nd Lord\nd*.>> Then they would return to their own home. 

\v 21 And the \nd Lord\nd* visited Hannah so that she conceived and bore three sons and two daughters. The child Samuel grew up before the \nd Lord\nd*. 

\p

\v 22 Now Eli was very old; and whenver he heard what his sons were doing to all Israel, how they lay with the women who did service at the door of the tent of meeting, 

\v 23 he said to them, <<Why do you do such things as these, which I hear from the mouth of all the people. 

\v 24 No, my sons; for it is no good report that I hear the people of the \nd Lord\nd* spreading abroad. 

\v 25 If one man sin against another, God will mediate for him; but if a man sin against the \nd Lord\nd*, who shall act as mediator for him?>> Notwithstanding they did not listen to the voice of their father, because the \nd Lord\nd* desired to slay them. 

\v 26 But the lad Samuel kept on growing larger and better in the estimation both of the \nd Lord\nd* and of men. 

\p

\v 27 There came a man of God to Eli and said to him, <<Thus saith the \nd Lord\nd*, <I revealed myself to thy father's house, when they were in Egypt servants to Pharaoh's house, 

\v 28 and I chose him from all the tribes of Israel to be my priest to go up to my altar to burn sacrifices, to bear an ephod before me, and I gave to your father's house for food all the offerings of the Israelites made by fire. 

\v 29 Why do you look with envious eyes on my sacrifices and offerings, and honor your sons above me in fattening yourselves with the first-fruits of all the offerings which the Israelites bring me?> Therefore the \nd Lord\nd* the God of Israel says, <I had indeed thought that your house and the house of your father would walk before me forever;> but now saith the \nd Lord\nd*, <Far be it from me; for them who honor me I will honor, and they who despise me will be lightly esteemed. 

\v 31 The days are quickly coming when I Will cut off your arm and the arm of your father's house. 

\v 32 You will look in affliction and enviously on all the prosperity which I will give Israel; and there will not be an old man in your house forever. 

\v 33 The only one of you whom I do not cut off from my altar shall be spared to weep out his eyes and to wear out his body, and all of your household will die by the sword of men. 

\v 34 This shall be the sign to you that will come upon your two sons, Hophni and Phinehas: on the same day both will die. 

\v 35 And I will raise up for myself a faithful priest who will do according to that which is in my heart and in my desire; and I will build him an enduring house; and he shall walk before my anointed forever. 

\v 36 It will come to pass that everyone who is left in your house will come to do him obeisance for a piece of money or a loaf of bread, and will say, 'Put me, I beg, in one of the priests' offices, that I may eat a morsel of bread.'> >>

\p

\v 1 The child Samuel continued ministering before the \nd Lord\nd* in the the presence of Eli. The word of the \nd Lord\nd* was rare in those days; there were no frequent visions. 

\v 2 Once at that time, when Eli was lying in his Samuel place—his eyes had begun to grow dim, so that he could not see- 

\v 3 and while the lamp of God was still burning, and Samuel was lying in the temple of the \nd Lord\nd* where the ark of God was, 

\v 4 the \nd Lord\nd* called, <<Samuel! Samuel!>> He said, <<Here I am.>> 

\v 5 He ran to Eli, and said, <<Here I am; you called me.>> But he said, <<I didn't call, lie down again.>> So he went and lay down. 

\v 6 Then the \nd Lord\nd* called yet again, <<Samuel! Samuel!>> And Samuel arose and went to Eli and said, <<Here I am; you called me.>> But he answered, <<I didn't call, my son. Lie down again.>> 

\v 7 Now Samuel did not yet know the \nd Lord\nd* neither had the word of the \nd Lord\nd* yet been revealed to him. 

\v 8 So when the \nd Lord\nd* called Samuel again the third time, he arose and went to Eli, and said, <<Here I am; for you called me.>> Then Eli realized that the \nd Lord\nd* was calling the child. 

\v 9 So Eli said to Samuel, <<Go, lie down; and if you are called, say, <Speak, \nd Lord\nd*, for your servant is listening.>>> So Samuel went and lay down in his place. 

\v 10 Then the \nd Lord\nd* came, and stood there, and called as at other times, <<Samuel! Samuel!>> And Samuel said, <<Speak; for your servant is listening.>>

\v 11 And the \nd Lord\nd* said to Samuel, <<See, I am about to do such a thing in Israel, that the ears of everyone who hears it will ring. 

\v 12 In that day I will perform toward Eli all that I have spoken against his house from beginning to end. 

\v 13 For I have told him that I will judge his house forever, for the guilt which he knew, in that his sons were blaspheming God and he did not restrain them. 

\v 14 Therefore I have sworn to the house of Eli that the guilt of Eli's house shall not be expiated with sacrifice nor offering forever.>>

\p

\v 15 And Samuel lay there until the morning. Then he rose early in the morning and opened the doors of the house of the \nd Lord\nd*. Samuel was afraid to make the known the vision to Eli. 

\v 16 But Eli called Samuel and said, <<Samuel, my son.>> He said, <<I am here.>> 

\v 17 He said, <<What is the thing that the \nd Lord\nd* has spoken to you? Hide nothing from me. May God do to you whatever he will, if you conceal from me a word of all that he spoke to you. >>

\v 18 So Samuel told him everything; and hid nothing from him. And Eli said, <<It is the \nd Lord\nd*; let him do what seems good to him.>>

\p

\v 19 And Samuel grew, and the \nd Lord\nd* was with him and let none of his words fall to the ground. 

\v 20 All Israel from Dan even to Beersheba knew that Samuel was established as a prophet of the \nd Lord\nd*. 

\v 21 And the \nd Lord\nd* again appeared in Shiloh, for the \nd Lord\nd* revealed himself to Samuel. 

\c 4 

\v 1 Thus prophet the word of Samuel came to all Israel. 

\p

Now in those days the Philistines assembled to make war against Israel. Israel went out against the Philistines to battle, and encamped at Ebenezer; and the Philistines encamped in Aphek. 

\v 2 The Philistines put themselves in array against Israel, and Israel was smitten before the Philistines, and the battle was hard fought and they slew in the ranks on the field about four thousand men. 

\v 3 But when the people returned to the camp, the elders of Israel said, <<Why has the \nd Lord\nd* smitten us today before the Philistines? Let us bring to us the ark of our God out of Shiloh, that it may come among us and save us from the hand of our enemies.>>

\v 4 So they sent to Shiloh; and took from there the ark of the \nd Lord\nd* of armies who sits enthroned above the cherubim. The two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark of God. 

\v 5 When the ark of God the \nd Lord\nd* came to the the camp, all Israel shouted such a great shout that the earth rang. 

\p

\v 6 When the Philistines heard the noise of the shout, they said, <<What does this great shouting in the Hebrew's camp mean?>> When they learned that the ark of the \nd Lord\nd* had come to the camp, 

\v 7 they were afraid, and said, <<These are their gods. They have come to them to the camp. 

\v 8 Woe to Woe to us! Nothin like this has happened to us before! Who can deliver us out of the hand of these mighty gods? These are the gods who smote the Egyptians with every sort of plague and pesilence. 

\v 9 Be strong, and be men, O Philistines, so that you will not become slaves to the Hebrews, as they have been slaves to you.>>

\p

\v 10 So the Philistines fought and there was great slaughter. Israel was defeated and each fled to his home. There fell of Israel thirty thousand footmen. 

\v 11 The ark of God was taken, and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, perished. 

\p

\v 12 A Benjamite ran from the ranks and came to Shiloh the same day with his garments torn and with earth on his head. 

\v 13 Just as he came, Eli was sitting upon his seat beside the gate watching the road, for his heart was trembling for the ark of God. When the man came to the city to inform it, all the city cried out. 

\v 14 When Eli heard the noise of the crying he said, <<What is this tumultuous noise?>> The man came quickly and told Eli. 

\v 15 (Now Eli was ninety-eight years old, and his eyes were set, so that he could not see). 

\v 16 The man said to Eli, <<I have come from the battle, for I fled today from the ranks.>> He said, <<How went the matter, my son?>>

\v 17 He that brought the tidings answered, <<Israel fled before the Philistines, and there was also a great slaughter among the people, and your two sons also, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead, and the ark of God has been captured.>>

\v 18 When he mentioned the ark of God, Eli fell from his seat backward by the side of the gate; and his neck was broken and he died, for he was old and heavy. He had judged Israel forty years. 

\p

\v 19 His daughter-in-law, Phinehas's wife, was pregnant and near her time. When she heard the report regarding the capture of the ark of God, and that her father-in-law and her husband were dead, she went into labor and crouched down and gave birth to a child. 

\v 20 As she lay dying, the women who stood by her said to her, <<Do not fear, for you have given birth to a son.>> But she neither answered nor heeded. 

\v 21 So they named the child Ichabod, saying, <<The glory is taken away from Israel, because of the capture of the ark of God, and because of her father-in-law and her husband.>>

\c 5 

\p

\v 1 The Philistines took the ark of God and brought it from Ebenezer to Ashdod. 

\v 2 Then the Philistines took the ark of the \nd Lord\nd* and brought it to the house of Dagon and set it up by the side of Dagon. 

\v 3 When the Ashdodites arose early the next day, there was Dagon fallen upon his face to the ground before the ark of the \nd Lord\nd*. They raised up Dagon and set him in his place again. 

\v 4 But when they arose early on the following morning, behold there was Dagon fallen upon his face to the ground before the ark of the \nd Lord\nd*. The head of Dagon and both his hands were cut off upon the threshold, and only the body of Dagon was left. 

\v 5 This is why the priests of Dagon and all who enter the house of Dagon do not tread on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod to this day, but step over it. 

\v 6 The hand of the \nd Lord\nd* was heavy upon the Ashdodites, and he destroyed them, and struck them with tumors, both in Ashdod and its borders. 

\v 7 When the men of Ashdod saw that it was so, they said, <<The ark of the God of Israel must not remain with us, for his hand is severe on us and on Dagon our god.>>

\v 8 So they sent and gathered together all the lords of the Philistines, and said, <<What should we do with the ark of the God of Israel?>> They answered, <<Let the ark of the God of Israel be brought around to Gath.>> So they moved the ark of the God of Israel to Gath. 

\v 9 But after they had brought it to Gath, the hand of the \nd Lord\nd* was against the city—there was a very great panic—and he struck the men of the city, both young and old, so that tomors broke out on them. 

\v 10 So they sent the ark of God to Ekron. But when the ark of God came to Ekron, the Ekronites cried out, <<They have brought around the ark of the God of Israel to us, to slay us and our people.>>

\v 11 They sent therefore and gathered together all the lords of the Philistines and said, <<Send away the ark of the God of Israel, let it go back to its own place and not kill us and our people.>> For a deadly panic had seized the entire city. The hand of God was very heavy there. 

\v 12 The men who did not die were stricken with the tomors, and the cry of lamentation from the city went up to heaven.

\c 6 

\v 1 The ark of the \nd Lord\nd* was in the country of the Philistines seven months. 

\v 2 Then the Philistines summoned the priests and the diviners, saying, What shall we do with the ark of the \nd Lord\nd*? Show us how we shall send it to its place. 

\v 3 They said, If you are sending the ark of the God of Israel, you must not send it away empty; but you must return to him a trespass-offering. Then you will be healed and it shall be made known to you why his hand is not removed from you. 

\v 4 Then said they, What shall be the trespass-offering which we shall return to him? They said, Five golden boils, and five golden mice, corresponding to the number of the tyrants of the Philistines; for one plague was upon you as well as upon your tyrants. 

\v 5 Therefore you shall make images of your boils, and images of your mice that mar the land; and you shall give glory to the God of Israel; perhaps he will lighten his hand from upon you and your gods and your land. 

\v 6 Why then will you make your hearts stubborn, as the Egyptians and Pharaoh made their hearts stubborn? Was it not after he had made sport of them that they let them go so that they departed? 

\v 7 Now therefore take and prepare a new cart, and two milch cows upon which the yoke has not come; and fasten the cows to the cart, but you shall leave their calves behind them at home. 

\v 8 Take the ark of the \nd Lord\nd* and place it on the cart and put the golden objects which you are returning to him as a trespass-offering, in a box at its side. Then send it away that it may depart. 

\v 9 See, if it goes on the way to its own border to Bethshemesh, then it is he who hath done us this great harm, but if not, then we shall know that it was not his hand that smote us; it was an accident that befell us. 

\v 10 The men did so, and took two mulch cows and fastened them to the cart, and shut up their calves at home. 

\v 11 They placed the ark of the \nd Lord\nd* on the cart, and the box with the golden mice and the images of their threew boils. 

\v 12 The cows took a straight course in the direction of Bethshemesh; they went along the highway, lowing as they went, and did not turn aside to the right hand or to the left. The tyrants of the Philistines went after them to the border of Bethshemesh. 

\v 13 The inhabitants of Bethshemesh were harvesting their wheat in the valley. They lifted up their eyes and saw the ark, and came rejoicing to meet it. 

\v 14 When the cart came into the field of Joshua the Bethshemeshite, it stood still there. A great stone was there. So they split up the wood of the cart and offered the cows as a burnt-offering to the \nd Lord\nd*. 

\v 18 But the Levites took down the ark of the \nd Lord\nd* and the box that was with it, in which were the golden objects, and placed them on the great stone; and the men of Bethshemesh offered to the \nd Lord\nd* on that day burnt-offerings and ordinary sacrifices. 

\v 16 When the five tyrants of the Philistines saw it, they returned to Ekron on that day. 

\v 17 These are the golden boils which the Philistines returned as a trespass-offering to the \nd Lord\nd*: for Ashdod one, for Gaza one, for Ashkelon one, for Gath one, for Ekron one. 

\v 18 But the golden mice correspond to the number of all the cities of the Philistines belonging to the five tyrants, both of fortified cities and of country villages. A witness is the great stone,e by which they set down the ark of the \nd Lord\nd*. To this day it is in the field of Joshua of Bethshemesh. 

\v 19 The sons of Jechoniah, however, did not rejoice with the men of Bethshemesh, when they looked upon the ark of the \nd Lord\nd*. So he smote among them seventy men; and the people mourned because the \nd Lord\nd* had smitten the people with a great slaughter. 

\v 20 The men of Bethshemesh said, Who is able to stand before the \nd Lord\nd* this holy God? To whom shall he go up from us? 

\v 21 Then they sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kiriath-jearim, saying, The Philistines have brought back the ark of the \nd Lord\nd*. Come down and bring it up to you. 

\c 7 

\v 1 So the men of Kiriathjearim came, and brought up the ark of the \nd Lord\nd*, and carried it into the house of Abinadab on the hill, and consecrated Eleazar his son to guard the ark of the \nd Lord\nd*. 

\v 2 From the time the ark began to abide in Kiriathjearim, many years passed, and it was twenty years. Then all the nation of Israel turned to the \nd Lord\nd*. 

\v 3 And Samuel spoke to all the nation Israel, saying, If with all your heart you are returning to the \nd Lord\nd*, then put away the foreign gods and the Ashtartesm from among you and direct your hearts towards the \nd Lord\nd* and serve him alone that he may deliver you out of the hand of the Philistines. 

\v 4 Then the Israelites put away the Baalim and the Ashtartes, and served the \nd Lord\nd* only. 

\v 5 And Samuel said, Assemble all Israel at Mizpah and I will intercede for you with the \nd Lord\nd*. 

\v 6 So they assembled at Mizpah, and drew water and poured it out before the \nd Lord\nd*, and fasted on that day and said, We have sinned against the \nd Lord\nd*. And Samuel judged th e Israelites in Mizpah. 

\v 7 When the Philistines heard that the Israelites had assembled at Mizpah, the tyrants of the Philistines went up against Israel. When the Israelites heard it they were afraid of the Philistines. 

\v 8 The Israelites said to Samuel, Cease not to cry to the \nd Lord\nd* our God for us, that he will save us out of the power of the Philistines. 

\v 9 And Samuel took a sucking lamb, and offered it as a whole burnt-offering to the \nd Lord\nd*; and Samuel cried to the \nd Lord\nd* in behalf of Israel, and the \nd Lord\nd* answered him. 

\v 10 While Samuel was offering the burnt-offering, the Philistines drew near to fight against Israel; but the \nd Lord\nd* thundered with a loud voice on that day against the Philistines, and threw them into confusion, and they were defeated before Israel. 

\v 11 The men of Israel went forth from Mizpah and pursued the Philistines and smote them until they were below Bethcar. 

\v 12 Then Samuel took a stone and set it between Mizpah and Yeshanag and called its name Ebenezer, saying, Hitherto hath the \nd Lord\nd* helped us. 

\v 13 So the Philistines were subdued and came no more within the border of Israel. The hand of the \nd Lord\nd* was against the Philistines all the days of Samuel. 

\v 14 The cities which the Philistines had taken from Israel were restored to Israel from Ekr on even to Gath; and their territory Israel delivered from the power of the Philistines. There was peace between Israel and the Amorites. 

\v 15 Now Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life. 

\v 16 He used to go around from year to year in succession to Bethel, Gilgal, and Mizpah; and he used to judge Israel in all those places. 

\v 17 His return was to Ramah, for there was his home; and there he judged Israel. There he built an altar to the \nd Lord\nd*. 

\c 8 

\v 1 But when Samuel was old he appointed his sons judges over Israel. 

\v 2 The name of his eldest was Joel, and the name of his second, Abijah; they were judges in Beersheba) 

\v 3 However his sons walked not in his ways, but turned aside after unjust gain and took bribes and perverted justice. 

\v 4 Then all the elders of Israel assembled and came to Samuel at Ramah, and they said to him, See, you have become old and your sons walk not in your ways. Now appoint for us a king to and judge us like all the nations. 

\v 6 But the statement displeased Samuel, when they said, Give us a king to judge us. And Samuel prayed to the \nd Lord\nd*. 

\v 7 And the \nd Lord\nd* said to Samuel, Listen to the voice of the people according to all that they say to thee; for they have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me from being king over them. 

\v 8 Like all the deeds which they have done to me since the day that I brought them up out of Egypt even to this day, in that they have forsaken me and served other gods, so also are they doing to thee. 

\v 9 Now therefore hearken to their voice, except that thou shalt solemnly warn them, and shalt show them the prerogative of the king who shall reign over them. 

\v 10 And Samuel told all the words of the \nd Lord\nd* to the people who were asking of him a king. 

\v 11 He said, This will be the prerogative of the king who shall reign over you : he will take your sons and appoint them for himself over his chariots and horsemen; and they shall run before his chariots; 

\v 12 and he shall appoint them for himself as commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds, and some to plow his ground and to reap his harvest and to make his implements of war and the furnishings for his chariots. 

\v 13 He will take your daughters to be perfumers and to be cooks and to be bakers. 

\v 14 Of your fields and your vineyards and your oliveyards, he will take the best and give them to his servants. 

\v 15 He will take the tithe of your grain fields and of your vineyards and give to his eunuchs and to his servants. 

\v 16 He will take your men-servants and your maid-servants, and the best of your cattlen and your asses, and use them for his work. 

\v 17 He will take the tithe of your flocks; and you shall become his servants. 

\v 18 Then you will cry out in that day on account of your king whom you will have chosen for yourselves; but the \nd Lord\nd* will not answer you in that day. 

\v 19 But the people refused to listen to the voice of Samuel, and said, Nay, but a king shall be over us, 

\v 20 that we also may be like all the nations, and that our king may judge us and go out before us and fight our battles. 

\v 21 And Samuel heard all the words of the people and repeated them to the \nd Lord\nd*. 

\v 22 And the \nd Lord\nd* said to Samuel, Listen to their voice and make them a king. And Samuel said to the men of Israel, Go every man to his city. 

\c 9 

\v 1 Now there was a man of Gibeahi, whose name was Kish the son of Abiel, the son of Zeror, the son of Becorath, the son of Aphiah, a Benjamite, a man well to do) 

\v 2 He had a son whose name was Saul, a man in the prime of life and handsome; and there was not one among the Israelites more handsome than he. From his shoulders and upwards he was higher than any of the people. 

\v 3 Now the she-asses of Kish, Saul's father, were lost. And Kish said to Saul his son, Take now one of the servants with you and arise and go seek the asses. 

\v 4 They passed through the hill-country of Ephraim, and the land of Shalishah, but did not find them. Then they passed through the land of Shaalim, but they were not there. They passed through the land of the Benjamites but did not find them. 

\v 5 When they were. come into the land of Zuph, Saul said to his servant who was with him, Come, let us return, lest my father cease thinking of the asses and become anxious for us. 

\v 6 He answered him, Behold now, there is in this city a man of God, and the man is held in honor; all that he says is sure to come true. Now let us go thither; perhaps he can give us information regarding the mission on which we are going. 

\v 7 Then Saul said to his servant, But, suppose we go, what shall we take to the man? for the bread is gone from our sacks, and there is no present to take to the man of God. What have we? 

\v 8 The servant answered Saul again, and said, See I have with me a fourth part of a silver shekel, and young shall give it to the man of God that he may furnish us information regarding our mission. 

\v 9 (Formerly in Israel, when a man went to inquire of God, thus he said, Come let us go to the seer; for he who is now called a prophet was previously called a seer). 

\v 10 Then Saul said to his servant, Your advice is good; come, let us go. So they went to the city where the man of God was. 

\v 11 As they were going up the ascent to the city, they met young maidens going out to draw water and said to them, Is the seer here? 

\v 12 They answered them and said, He is; behold he is before you. Make haste now, the for he is come today into the city; for the people have a sacrifice today on the high place. 

\v 13 As soon as you come to the city, you will at once find him before he goes up to the high place to eat; for the people will not eat until he come, for he is to bless the sacrifice; and afterwards the guests eat. Now therefore go up; for at this time you will meet him. 

\v 14 So they went up to the city. When they came within the city gate, Samuel was just coming out toward them, to go up to the high place. 

\v 15 Now the \nd Lord\nd* had given to Samuel, a day before Saul came, the following revelation: 

\v 16 At this time to-morrow I will send thee a man out of the land of Benjamin and thou shalt anoint him to be a prince over my people Israel. He shall save my people out of the hand of the Philistines; for I have seen the afflictiong of my people and their cry has come to me. 

\v 17 When Samuel saw Saul, the \nd Lord\nd* indicated to him, This is the man of whom I spoke to thee! He it is who shall rule over my people. 

\v 18 Then Saul drew near to Samuel in the gate, and said, Tell me, if you will, where the seer's house is. 

\v 19 And Samuel answered Saul and said, I am the seer; go up before me to the high place, for you shall eat with me today; and in the morning I will let you go, and will tell you all that is in your heart. 

\v 20 As for your asses that were lost three days ago, do not trouble yourself about them for they have been found. To whom belongs all that is desirable in Israel? Does it not to you, and to yours father's house? 

\v 21 And Saul answered and said, Am I not a Benjamite, of the smallest of the tribes of Israel, and is not my family the least of all the families of the tribe of Benjamin? Why then do you speak thus to me? 

\v 22 And Samuel took Saul and his servant and brought them into the hall and made them sit at the head of the guests (who were about thirty persons). 

\v 23 And Samuel said to the cook, Bring the portion I gave you, which I told you to put aside. 

\v 24 The cook took up the leg and placed it before Saul. And Samuel said, See, the meat is served! eat! for it was kept for you until the appointed time, that you might eat with those whom I have invited. So Saul ate with Samuel that day. 

\v 25 After they came down from the high place into the city, they spread a bed for Saul on the roof, and he lay down. 

\v 26 Then at daybreak Samuel called to Saul on the roof, saying, Up, that I may send you away. So Saul arose, and he and Samuel went out into the street. 

\v 27 As they were going down at the outskirts of the city, Samuel said to Saul, Bid the servant pass on before us, but you stand here that I may make known to you the word of God. 

\c 10 

\v 1 Then Samuel took the vial of oil, and poured it on his head, and kissed him and said, Hath not the \nd Lord\nd* anointed you to be a prince over his people Israel? You shall reign over the people of the \nd Lord\nd* and deliver them from the power of their enemies around about. This shall be the sign that the \nd Lord\nd* has anointed you to be a prince over his heritage: 

\v 2 when you go from me today you shall find two men at Rachel's tomb, in the boundary of Benjamin at Zelzah; and they will say to you, 'The asses which you went to seek are found, and now your father has dismissed the matter of the asses and is anxious for you, saying, "What shall I do for my son?"' 

\v 3 Then you shall go on from there and come to the oak of Tabor; and there three men going up to God to Bethel will meet you, one carrying three kids, and another carrying three loaves of bread, and another carrying a skin of wine. 

\v 4 They will salute you and give you two loaves of bread which you shall take from their hand. 

\v 5 After that you shall come to Gibeah, where is the garrison of the Philistines; and furthermore when you come thither to the city, you shall meet a band of prophets coming down from the high place with a lyre, a tambourine, a flute, and a harp before them; and they will be prophesying. 

\v 6 The spirit of the \nd Lord\nd* will rush upon you, and you shall prophesy with them and shall be turned into another man. When these signs come to you, you shall do as the occasion offers; for God is with you. 

\v 8 Now when Samuel anointed Saul, he commanded him, saying, You shall go down before me to Gilgal, and then I will come down to you, to offer burnt-offerings.	Wait seven days until I come to you and show you what you shall do. 

\v 9 Accordingly when he turned his back to go from Samuel, God gave him another heart, and all those signs came to pass that day. 

\v 10 Just as he came thence to Gibeah, a band of prophets met him, and he prophesied among them. 

\v 11 When every one who knew him saw him in the act of prophesying with the prophets, the people said to one another, What is this that has come upon the son of Kish? Is Saul also among the prophets? 

\v 12 One of the bystanders answered and said, Who is their father? Therefore it became a proverb, Is Saul also among the prophets? 

\v 13 When he had made an end of prophesying, he went to the high place. 

\v 14 And Saul's cousin said to him and to his servant, Where did you go? He said, To seek the asses; and when we saw that they were not found, we went to Samuel. 

\v 15 And Saul's cousin said, Tell me, I pray, what Samuel said to you. 

\v 16 And Saul said to his cousin, He told us definitely that the asses were found. But concerning the matter of the kingdom, of which Samuel had spoken, he told him nothing. 

\v 17 And Samuel called the people together to Mizpah; 

\v 18 and he said to the Israelites, Thus saith the \nd Lord\nd* the God of Israel, I brought up Israel out of Egypt, and I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all the kingdoms that were oppressing you. 

\v 19 But you yourselves have this day rejected your God, who himself has been saving you from all your calamities and your distresses, and you have said to him, 'Nay, but a king shalt thou set over us.' Now therefore present yourselves before the \nd Lord\nd* by your tribes and by your thousands. 

\v 20 So Samuel brought all the tribes of Israel near, and the tribe of Benjamin was taken. 

\v 21 He brought the tribe of Benjamine near by their clans; and the clan of the Matrites was taken; and he brought near the clan of Matri man by man and Saul the son of Kish was taken; but when they sought him he could not be found. 

\v 22 Therefore they asked of the \nd Lord\nd* further, Did the man come hither? And the \nd Lord\nd* answered Behold he hath hid himself among the baggage. 

\v 23 One ran and brought him from there. When he stood among the people, he was taller than any of the people from his shoulders upward. 

\v 24 Said Samuel to the the people, Have you seen him whom the \nd Lord\nd* hath chosen? for there is none like him among all the people. All the people shouted loudly. May the king live! 

\v 25 Thus Samuel revealed to the people the manner of the kingdom, and wrote it in a book, and laid it up before the \nd Lord\nd*. And Samuel sent all the people away, each man to his home. 

\v 26 And Saul also went to his home at Gibeah; and there went with him the brave men whose hearts God had touched. 

\v 27 But there were base scoundrels who said, How shall this man save us? They despised him, and brought him no present. 

\c 11 

\v 1 Now it came to pass after about a month that Nahash the Ammonite came up and besieged Jabesh in Gilead; and all the men of Jabesh said to Nahash, Make terms with us and we will serve you. 

\v 2 But Nahash the Ammonite said to them, On this condition will I make terms with you : that I bore out the right eye of each of you and thereby bring a reproach upon all Israel. 

\v 3 The elders of Jabesh said to him, Give us seven days respite, that we may send messengers through all the territory of Israel. Then if there be none to save us we will come to you. 

\v 4 So the messengers came to Gibeah of Saul and recounted the facts in the hearing of the people, and all the people wept aloud. 

\v 6 And Saul was just coming from the field after the oxen. And Saul said, What is the trouble with the people that they are weeping? Then they told him the words of the men of Jabesh. 

\v 6 The spirit of the \nd Lord\nd* rushed upon Saul when he heard these words, and his anger was greatly aroused. 

\v 7 He took a yoke of oxen, and cut them in pieces, and sent them throughout all the territory of Israel by the hand of messengers, saying, Whoever does not come forth after Saul and after Samuel, so shall it be done to his oxen. Then a terror from the \nd Lord\nd* fell upon the people, and they rallied as one man. 

\v 8 He mustered them in Bezek; and the Israelites were three hundred thousand, and the men of Judah thirty thousand. 

\v 9 They said to the messengers who came, Thus say to the men of Jabesh in Gilead, 'Tomorrow, by the time the sun becomes hot, deliverance shall come to you.' So the messengers came and told the men of Jabesh, and they were glad. 

\v 10 Therefore the men of Jabesh said, To-morrow we will come out to you, and you shall do to us whatever you please. 

\v 11 Accordingly on the following day, Saul divided the people into three divisions; and they came into the midst of the camp in the morning watch, and smote the Ammonites, until the heat of the day. Then they who remained scattered, so that no two of them were left together. 

\v 12 The people say to Samuel, Who is he who says, 'Saul shall not reign over us?' Bring the men that we may put them to death. 

\v 13 And Saul said, To-day not a man shall be put to death, for today the \nd Lord\nd* hath wrought deliverance in Israel. 

\v 14 Then said Samuel to the people, Come, and let us go to Gilgal, and renew the kingdom there. 

\v 15 All the people when to Gilgal; and there they made Saul king before the \nd Lord\nd* in Gilgal; and there they sacrificed peace-offerings before the \nd Lord\nd*; and there Saul and all the men of Israel rejoiced exceedingly. 

\c 12 

\v 1 Then Samuel said to all Israel, See, I have hearkened to your voice in all that you have said to me and have appointed a king over you. 

\v 2 From now on, behold the king who will go before you; but as for me, I am old and gray, and my sons are with you: and I have walked before you from my youth to this day. 

\v 3 Here am I! Testify against my before the \nd Lord\nd*, and before his annointed: whose ox have I taken? or whose ass have I taken? or whom have I oppressed? whom have I defrauded? or from whose hand have I taken a ransom, or a sandal? Testify and I will restore it to you. 

\v 4 They said, You have not oppressed us, nor defrauded us, nor have you taken anything from any man's hand. 

\v 5 Therefore he said to them, the \nd Lord\nd* is witness against you, and his anointed is witness this day, that you have not found anything in my hand. They said, He is witness. 

\v 6 Then Samuel said to the people, the \nd Lord\nd* is witness, who appointed Moses and Aaron and who brought your fathers up out of the land of Egypt. 

\v 7 Now therefore take your stand that I may declare to you before the \nd Lord\nd* all the righteous acts of the \nd Lord\nd*, which he did to you and to your fathers. 

\v 8 When Jacob came to Egypt, and your fathers cried to the \nd Lord\nd*, then the \nd Lord\nd* sent Moses and Aaron to bring your fathers out of Egypt, and made a them dwell in this place. 

\v 9 But they forgot the \nd Lord\nd* their God, and he sold them into the hand of Sisera, commander of the army of Hazor, and into the hand of the Philistines and into the hand of the king of Moab; and they fought against them. 

\v 10 They cried to the \nd Lord\nd* and said, We have sinned because we have forsaken the \nd Lord\nd* and served the Baalim and the Ashtartes. But now deliver us out of the hand of our enemies, and we will serve thee. 

\v 11 And the \nd Lord\nd* sent Jerubbaal, and Barak, and Jephthah, and Samuel, and delivered you out of the hand of your enemies round about you so that you dwelt in safety. 

\v 12 You saw that Nahash the king of the Ammonites came against you. You said to me, 'Nay, but a king shall reign over us,' although the \nd Lord\nd* your God was your king. 

\v 13 Now therefore see the king whom you have chosen, for the \nd Lord\nd* has now set a king over you. 

\v 14 If you will fear the \nd Lord\nd* and serve him and listen to his voice, and not rebel against the commandment of the \nd Lord\nd*, and both you and the king who reigns over you follow the \nd Lord\nd* your God, well. 

\v 15 But if you will not hearken to the voice of the \nd Lord\nd*, but rebel against the commandment of the \nd Lord\nd*, then shall the hand of the \nd Lord\nd* be against you and your king. 

\v 16 Now therefore take your stand and see this great thing, which the \nd Lord\nd* is about to do before your eyes. 

\v 17 Is it not wheat harvest today? I will call upon the \nd Lord\nd*, to send thunder and rain; and you shall know and see that your wickedness is great, which you have done in the sight of the \nd Lord\nd* in asking you a king. 

\v 18 So Samuel called upon the \nd Lord\nd*, and the \nd Lord\nd* sent thunder and rain that day; and all the people were greatly afraid of the \nd Lord\nd* and Samuel. 

\v 19 Then all the people said to Samuel, Intercede with the \nd Lord\nd* your God in behalf of your servants that we die not; for we have added to all our sins the crime of asking a king. 

\v 20 But Samuel said to the people, Fear not; you have indeed done all this evil, yet do not turn aside from following the \nd Lord\nd*, but serve the \nd Lord\nd* with all your heart; 

\v 21 and do not turn aside after vain final things which cannot profit or deliver, for they are vain. 

\v 22 For the \nd Lord\nd* because of his great name will not cast away his people, for the \nd Lord\nd* has undertaken to make you a people for himself. 

\v 23 Moreover, as for me, far be it from me that I should sin against the \nd Lord\nd* in ceasing to intercede for you; but I will instruct you in the good and the right way. 

\v 24 Only fear the \nd Lord\nd* and serve him in truth with all your heart, for you see what a great thing he hath done in your presence. 

\v 25 But if you persist in doing wrong, both you and your king shall be destroyed. 

\c 13 

\v 2 Saul chose him three thousand men of of Israel: two thousand were with Saul in Michmash and on the mountain of Bethel and a thousand were with Jonathan his sons in Gibeah of Benjamin. But the rest of the people he had sent each to his home. 

\v 3 Then Jonathan smote the garrison of the Philistines that was in Gibeah. The Philistines heard the report, The Hebrews have revolted. But Saul had meantime caused the trumpet to be blown throughout all the land. 

\v 4 All Israel heard the report, Saul has smitten the garrison of the Philistines, and also Israel has brought itself into ill odor with the Philistines. The Philistines were gathered together to fight with Israel. 

\v 5 The Philistines were gathered together to fight with Israel — thirty thousand chariots and six thousand horsemen and people 

\v 6 as numerous as the sand on the sea. They came up and encamped in Michmash, east of Bethaven. When the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait (for the people were hard pressed), the people hid themselves in caves, in holes, in rocks, in tombs, and in pits. 

\v 7 Also many people went over the Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead. But Saul was still in Gilgal, and all the people followed him trembling. 

\v 8 He waited seven days for the appointed time which Samuel had set; but Samuel did not come to Gilgal, and the people scattered away from him. 

\v 9 Therefore Saul said, Bring here to me the burnt-offering and the peace-offerings. He offered the burnt-offering. 

\v 10 Then, just as he had finished offering the burnt-offering, Samuel came; and Saul went out to greet him) 

\v 11 But Samuel said, What have you done? And Saul said, Because I saw that the people were scattering away from me and you did not come within the appointed time, and the Philistines were gathering together at Mich-mash, 

\v 12 I said, 'Now will the Philistines come down to me at Gilgal, and I shall not have appeased the \nd Lord\nd*.' So I constrained myself and offered the burnt-offering. 

\v 13 Then Samuel said to Saul, You have acted foolishly. If you had kept the command of Jehovah your God, which he commanded you, then would the \nd Lord\nd* have established your kingdom over Israel forever. 

\v 14 But now your kingdom shall not continue. the \nd Lord\nd* hath sought out a man after his own heart, and the \nd Lord\nd* hath appointed him a leader over his people, because you have not kept that which Jehovah commanded you. 

\v 15 Then Samuel arose and went up from Gilgal and proceeded on his way to Gibeah of Benjamin. 

\v 15 And Saul numbered the people who were with him, about six hundred men. 

\v 16 And Saul and Jonathan his son, together with the people who were with them, were staying in Gibeah of Benjamin, while the Philistines encamped in Michmash. 

\v 17 The plunderers came out of the camp of the Philistines in three divisions: one division turned in the direction of Ophrah in the land of Shual, 

\v 18 and another division turned in the direction of Bethhoron, and another division turned in the direction of the hill that looks down over the valley of Zeboim toward the wilderness. 

\v 19 Now there was no smith found throughout all the land of Israel, for the Philistines said, Lest the Hebrews make sword or speak; 

\v 20 but all the Israelites went down to the Philistines to sharpen each his plowshare and his coulter and his ax and his mattock; 

\v 21 yet they had a file for the mattocks, and for the coulters and for the forks and for the axes and to set the ox-goads.. 

\v 22 So it came to pass on the day of Michmash that none of the people with Saul and Jonathan had either sword or spear; but Saul and Jonathan his son had them. 

\v 23 The garrison of the Philistines went out to the pass of Michmash. 

\c 14 

\v 1 Now on that day Jonathan the son of Saul said to the young man who bore his armor, Come and let us go over to the Philistines' garrison, that is on the other side. But he did not tell his father. 

\v 2 And Saul was sitting in the outskirts of Gibeah under the pomegranate tree which is by the threshing-floor, and the people who were with him numbered about six hundred men. 

\v 3 And Ahijah the son of Ahitub, Ichabod's brother, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eli, the priest of the \nd Lord\nd* at Shiloh, was in charge of an ephod. The people did not know that Jonathan had gone. 

\v 4 Between the passes by which Jonathan sought to go over to the Philistines' garrison there was a rocky crag on the one side, and a rocky crag on the other side; and the name of the one was Bozez [the Shining], and the name of the other Seneh [the Thorny]. 

\v 5 The one crag rose up on the north in front of Michmash, and the other on the south in front of Geba. 

\v 6 And Jonathan said to the young man who bore his armor, Come, let us go over to the garrison of these uncircumcised Philistines; perhaps the \nd Lord\nd* will act for us, for there is nothing that can prevent the \nd Lord\nd* from saving by many or by few. 

\v 7 His armorbearer said to him, Do whatever your judgment dictates; see I am with you; your wish is mine. 

\v 8 Then Jonathan said, See, we will pass over to the men and show ourselves to them. 

\v 9 If they say to us, 'Stand still until we can reach you,' then we will stand still in our place, and will not go up to them. 

\v 10 But if they say, 'Come up to us,' then we will go up; for the \nd Lord\nd* has given them into our hand; and this shall be the sign to us. 

\v 11 Now when both of them showed themselves to the garrison of the Philistines, the Philistines said, There are Hebrews coming out of the holes where they have hidden themselves. 

\v 12 The men of the garrison cried out to Jonathan and his armorbearer, saying, Come up to us that we may tell you something. Then Jonathan said to his armorbearer, Come up after me; for the \nd Lord\nd* has given them into the hand of Israel. 

\v 13 And Jonathan climbed up on his hands and feet, and his armorbearer after him. They fell before Jonathan, and his armorbearer kept despatching them after him. 

\v 14 In the first attack Jonathan and his armorbearer slew about twenty men with javelins and rocks from the field. 

\v 15 There was a trembling in the camp, in the field, and among all the people; the garrison, and even the raiders also trembled; and the earth quaked so that it produced a supernatural panic. 

\v 16 The watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin looked, and saw a tumult surging hither and thither. 

\v 17 Then said Saul to the people who were with him, Investigate now and see who is gone from us. When they had investigated they found that Jonathan and his armorbearer were not there. 

\v 18 And Saul said to Ahijah, Bring hither the ephod; for at that time he had charge of the ephod before Israel. 

\v 19 While Saul was yet speaking to the priest, the tumult in the camp of the Philistines kept on increasing. Therefore Saul said to the priest, Draw back your hand. 

\v 20 And Saul and all the people that were with him responded to the call, and came to the battle; and thereupon every man's sword was turned upon his fellow and there was very great confusion. 

\v 21 The Hebrews, who were with the Philistines heretofore, who had come up into the camp, also turned to be with the Israelites who were with Saul and Jonathan. 

\v 22 Likewise all the men of Israel, who were in hiding in the hill-country of Ephraim, when they heard that the Philistines fled, also pursued close after them in the battle. 

\v 23 So the \nd Lord\nd* saved Israel that day, and the battle passed over beyond Bethhoron. All the people were with Saul, about ten thousand men; and the fighting was scattered over all the hill-country of Ephraim. 

\v 24 Then Saul committed a great act of folly that day, for he laid an oath on the people, saying, Cursed is the man who shall eat any food until evening and until I avenge myself on my enemies. So none of the people tasted food. 

\v 25 Now there was honey on the surface of the ground, 

\v 26 and when the people came to the honeycomb, the bees had just flown away, but no one put his hand to his mouth, for the people feared the oath. 

\v 27 But Jonathan had not heard when his father adjured the people; therefore he put forth the end of the rod that was in his hand and dipped it in the honeycomb and put his hand to his mouth, and his eyes were lightened. 

\v 28 Then spoke up one of the people and said, Your father adjured the people saying, 'Cursed be the man who eats food this day.' But the people were exhausted. 

\v 29 Then said Jonathan, My father has brought disaster on the land. See how I have been refreshed, because I tasted a little of this honey. 

\v 30 If only the people had eaten freely today of the spoil of their enemies which they found, how much greater would have been the slaughter of the Philistines! 

\v 31 But they smote the Philistines that day from Michmash to Aijalon, and the people were very faint. 

\v 32 Then the people rushed upon the spoil and took sheep and oxen and calves and struck them to the earth, and the people ate them with the blood. 

\v 33 When they told Saul, saying, See, the people are sinning against the \nd Lord\nd* in eating with the blood, he said to those who told him, Roll hither to me a great stone. 

\v 34 And Saul said, Go out among the people and say to them, 'Let each man bring to me his ox and his sheep, and slay it here and eat; but do not sin against the \nd Lord\nd* in eating the flesh together with the blood. All the people brought that night, each what he had in his hand, and slew them there. 

\v 35 So Saul built an altar to the \nd Lord\nd*; that was the first altar that he built to the \nd Lord\nd*. 

\v 36 And Saul said, Let us go down after the Philistines by night and plunder amongw them until daybreak, and let us not leave a man of them. They said, Do whatever you think best. Then said the priest, Let us here draw near to God. 

\v 37 And Saul asked of God, Shall I go down after the Philistines? Wilt thou deliver them into the hand of Israel? But he did not answer him that day. 

\v 38 And Saul said, Come hither, all you chiefs of the people and know and see in whom is this guilt today. 

\v 39 For as the \nd Lord\nd* liveth, who delivereth Israel, though it be in Jonathan my son, he shall surely die. But no one of all the people answered him. 

\v 40 Then he said to all Israel, You be on one side, and I and Jonathan my son will be on the other side. The people said to Saul, Do what seems good to you. 

\v 41 Therefore Saul said, the \nd Lord\nd*, God of Israel, why hast thou not answered thy servant this day? If the guilt be in me or in Jonathan my son, the \nd Lord\nd*, God of Israel, give Urim; but if the guilt is in thy people Israel, give Thummim. a Then Jonathan and Saul were taken and the people escaped. 

\v 42 And Saul said, Cast the lot between me and Jonathan my son. He whom the \nd Lord\nd* shall take, must die. The people said to Saul, It shall not be so! But Saul overruled the people and they cast the lot between him and Jonathan his son. And Jonathan was taken. 

\v 43 Then Saul said to Jonathan, Tell me what you have done. And Jonathan told him saying, I did indeed taste a little honey with the end of the staff that was in my hand; and here I am! I am ready to die. 

\v 44 And Saul said, May God do to me whatever he pleases, you shall surely die, Jonathan! 

\v 45 But the people said to Saul, Shall Jonathan die who has wrought this great deliverance in Israel? Far from it! As the \nd Lord\nd* liveth, there shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground, for he has wrought with God this day. Therefore the people redeemed Jonathan, so that he did not die. Then Saul went up from pursuing the Philistines; and the Philistines went to their own country. 

\v 47 Now when Saul had taken the kingdom over Israel, he saes fought against all his enemies on every side: against Moab and the Ammonites and Edom and Beth-rehob,s the king of Zobah and the Philistines; and wherever he turned he was victorious. 

\v 48 He did mighty deeds and smote the Amalekites and delivered Israel out of the hands of its plunderers. 

\v 49 Now the sons of Saul were: Jonathan, Ishbaal, and Malchishua. And His these are the names of his two daughters: the eldest, Merab, the youngest, Michal. 

\v 50 The name of Saul's wife was Ahinoam the daughter of Ahimaaz. The name of the commander of his army was Abner the son of Ner, Saul's cousin. 

\v 51 And Kish the father of Saul and Ner the father of Abner were sons of Abiel. 

\v 52 But the war against the Philistines was severe all the days of Saul. Whenever Saul saw any valiant or efficient man, he would attach him to himself. 

\c 15 

\v 1 1And Samuel said to Saul, the \nd Lord\nd* sent	me to anoint you to be king over his people Israel. Now therefore listen to the words of the \nd Lord\nd*. 

\v 2 Thus saith the \nd Lord\nd* of armies, 'I have determined tes to punish that which Amalek did to Israel, in that he opposed him in the way, when he came up out of Egypt. 

\v 3 Now go and smite Amalek and utterly destroy him and all that he has, and spare him not, but slay both man and woman, child and infant, ox and sheep, camel and ass. 

\v 4 And Saul summoned the people and mustered them in Telaim, two hundred thousand footmen and ten thousand men of Judah. 

\v 5 When Saul came to the city of Amalek, he lay in wait in the valley. 

\v 6 And Saul said to the Kenites, Go away, withdraw from among the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them, for you showed kindness to all the Israelites when they came up from Egypt. So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites. 

\v 7 And Saul smote the Amalekites from Havilah as far as Shur, which is before Egypt. 

\v 8 He took Agag the king of Amalek alive and completely destroyed all the people with the sword. 

\v 9 But Saul and the people spared Agag and the best of the sheep, the oxen, the fatlings, the lambs, and all that was good, and would not completely destroy them; but everything that was worthless and despised, that they completely destroyed. 

\v 10 Then the word of the \nd Lord\nd* came to Samuel saying, 

\v 11 I repent that I have made Saul king, for he has turned from following me and has not carried out my commands. And Samuel was angry and cried to the \nd Lord\nd* all night. 

\v 12 Early in the morning Samuel rose to meet Saul. Then Samuel was told, Saul came to Carmel and has just set up a monument and has turned and passed on and gone down to Gilgal. 

\v 13 When Samuel came to Saul, Saul said to him, Blessed be thou of the \nd Lord\nd*! I have fulfilled the command of the \nd Lord\nd*. 

\v 14 And Samuel said, What then is this bleating of the sheep in my ears and the lowing of the cattle which I hear? 

\v 15 And Saul said, They have brought them from the Amalekites, for the people spared the best ofl the sheep and of the oxen to sacrifice to the \nd Lord\nd* your God; and the rest we have completely destroyed. 

\v 16 Then Samuel said to Saul, Stop! and let me tell you what the \nd Lord\nd* hath said to me this night. He said to him, Speak. 

\v 17 And Samuel said, Though you are little in your own sight, are you not the head of the tribes of Israel? And the \nd Lord\nd* anointed you king over Israel, 

\v 18 and the \nd Lord\nd* sent you on an expedition and said, ' Go, and completely destroy the sinners of Amalek and fight against them until they are consumed.' 

\v 19 Why then did you not obey the voice of the \nd Lord\nd* and why did you swoop upon the spoil and displease the \nd Lord\nd*? 

\v 20 And Saul said to Samuel, I have obeyed the voice of Jehovah and have gone on the expedition upon which the \nd Lord\nd* sent me and have brought back Agag the king of the Amalekites and have completely destroyed the Amalekites. 

\v 21 But the people took of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the best of the things which were placed under the ban to sacrifice to the \nd Lord\nd* your God in Gilgal. 

\v 22 And Samuel said, Does the \nd Lord\nd* delight in burnt-offerings and sacrifices as in obedience to the voice of the \nd Lord\nd*? Behold to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams. For rebellion is as bad as the sin of divination, and obstinacy as the iniquity of the teraphim. Because you have rejected the word of the \nd Lord\nd*, He hath rejected you from being king. 

\v 24 And Saul said to Samuel, I have sinned, for I have transgressed the command of the \nd Lord\nd* and your words because I feared the people and listened to their voice. 

\v 25 Now therefore pardon for my sin and turn back with me, that I may worship the \nd Lord\nd*. 

\v 26 But Samuel said to Saul, I will not turn back with you, for you have rejected the word of the \nd Lord\nd* and the \nd Lord\nd* hath rejected you from being king over Israel. 

\v 27 As Samuel turned to go away, Saul seized the skirt of his robe, but it tore. 

\v 28 Then Samuel said to him, the \nd Lord\nd* hath today torn the kingdom of Israel from you and hath given it to your neighbor who is better than you. 

\v 29 Moreover the GloryP of Israel will not lie nor repent; for he is not a man that he should repent. 

\v 30 Then he said, I have sinned, yet honor me now at least before the elders of my people and before Israel, and turn back with me, that I may worship the \nd Lord\nd* your God. 

\v 31 So Samuel turned back and followed Saul, while Saul worshipped the \nd Lord\nd*. 

\v 32 Then Samuel said, Bring here to me Agag the king of the Amalekites. Fate of And Agag came to him trembling. And Agag said, Surely death is bitter. 

\v 33 And Samuel said, As your sword has bereaved women, so shall your mother be the most bereaved of women. Thereupon Samuel hewed Agag in pieces before the \nd Lord\nd* in Gilgal. 

\v 34 Then Samuel went to Ramah, but Saul went up to his house to Gibeah of Saul. 

\v 35 And Samuel saw Saul no more until the day of his death, for Samuel grieved over Saul. Now the \nd Lord\nd* repented that he had made Saul king over Israel, 

\c 16 

\v 1 and the \nd Lord\nd* said to Samuel, How long wilt thou grieve over Saul, when I have rejected him from being Samuel king over Israel? Fill thy horn with oil and go. I will send thee to Jesse the Bethlehemite; for I have provided me a king among his sons. 

\v 2 And Samuel said, How can I go, since Saul will hear of it and kill me? But the \nd Lord\nd* said, Take a calf with thee and say, ' To sacrifice to the \nd Lord\nd* am I come!' 

\v 3 Invite Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will show thee what thou shalt do, and anoint him whom I name to thee. 

\v 4 And Samuel did that which the \nd Lord\nd* had commanded. When he came to Bethlehem, the elders of the city came trembling to meet him and said, Does your coming betoken good? 

\v 6 He said Yes, to sacrifice to the \nd Lord\nd* am I come. Purify yourselves and rejoiced with me in the sacrifice. He purified Jesse and his sons and invited them to the sacrifice. 

\v 6 When they came and he saw Eliab, he said, Surely in the \nd Lord\nd*'s presence is his anointed. 

\v 7 But the \nd Lord\nd* said to Samuel, Look not on his appearance or on the height of his stature, since I have rejected him; for the \nd Lord\nd* doth not seer as man sees, for man looks on the outward appearance, but the \nd Lord\nd* looks at the heart. 

\v 8 Then Jesse called Abinadab, and brought him before Samuel. But he said, Neither hath the \nd Lord\nd* chosen this one. 

\v 9 Then Jesse brought forward Shammah. But he said, Neither hath the \nd Lord\nd* chosen this one. 

\v 10 Then Jesse brought his seven sons before Samuel. But Samuel said to Jesse, the \nd Lord\nd* hath not chosen these. 

\v 11 And Samuel said to Jesse, Are these all the young men? He said, There is still the youngest, and he is a shepherd with the flock. Therefore Samuel said to Jesse, Send and bring him, for we will not sit down until he is brought here. 

\v 12 So he sent and brought him in. Now he was ruddy, a youth with beautiful eyes and attractive appearance. And the \nd Lord\nd* said, Arise, anoint him, for he it is. 

\v 13 Then Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him in the midst of his brothers. The spirit of the \nd Lord\nd* came with power upon David from that day forward. And Samuel arose and went to Ramah. 

\v 14 Now the spirit of the \nd Lord\nd* had departed from Saul and an evil spirit from the \nd Lord\nd* tormented him. 

\v 15 And Saul's servants said to him, See now, an evil spirit from Jehovah is tormenting you. 

\v 16 Let your servants who are before you speak and they will seek for our lord a man skilful in playing the lyre. Then whenever the evil spirit comes upon you he shall play with his hand, and you will be better. 

\v 17 Then Saul said to his servants, Provide me now a man who plays well, and bring him to me. 

\v 18 Thereupon one of the young men answered and said, Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite who is skilful in playing and a valiant man, a soldier, judicious in speech, a man of good appearance, and Jehovah is with him. 

\v 19 Therefore Saul sent messengers to Jesse and said, Send me David your son, who is with the flock. 

\v 20 And Jesse took ten loaves g of bread, and a skin of wine, and a kid, and sent them to Saul by David his son. 

\v 21 So David came to Saul and entered his service; and he loved him so much that he became one of his armorbearers. 

\v 22 And Saul sent to Jesse, saying, Let David enter my service, for he has found favor in my sight. 

\v 23 Whenever the evil spirit from God came upon Saul, David would take the lyre and play with his hand and Saul would breathe freely and would feel better and the evil spirit would depart from him. 

\c 17 

\v 1 Now the Philistines mustered together their forces for war, and they were gathered together at Socoh, which belongs to Judah, and encamped between Socoh and Azekah, in Ephesdammim. 

\v 2 And Saul and the men of Israel were gathered together and encamped in the valley of Elah; and they drew up in battle-array against the Philistines. 

\v 3 The Philistines were standing on the mountain on the one side, and the Israelites were standing on the mountain on the other side, and the valley was between them. 

\v 4 There came out a champion from the camp of the Philistines, named Goliath of Gath, whose height was about ten feet. 

\v 5 He had a helmet of bronze upon his head, and he was clad with a bronze breastplate of scales, the weight of which was about two hundred pounds. 

\v 6 He had greaves of bronze upon his legs and a javelin of bronze between his shoulders. 

\v 7 The shaft of his spear was like a weaver's beam, and the head of his iron spear weighed twenty-four pounds; and his shield-bearer went before him 

\v 8 He stood and cried out to the ranks of Israel and said to them, Why have you come out to draw up the line of battle? Am not I a Philistine and you Saul's servants? Choose a man for yourselves and let him come down to me. 

\v 9 If he be able to fight with me and kill me, then will we be your servants; but if I prevail against him and kill him, then shall you be our servants and serve us. 

\v 10 The Philistine said, I have insulted the ranks of Israel today; give me a man that we may fight together. 

\v 11 When Saul and all Israel heard these words of the Philistine, they were terrified and greatly afraid. 

\v 12 Now David was the son of an Ephrathite of Bethlehem in Judah, whose name was Jesse, and he had eight sons. The man was old in the days of Saul, advanced in years among men. 

\v 13 The three eldest sons of Jesse had gone after Saul to the war; and the names of his three sons who went to the war were Eliab the eldest, his second Abinadab, and the third Shammah. 

\v 14 But David was the youngest; and the three eldest had followed Saul. 

\v 15 Now David went to and fro from Saul to feed his father's sheep at Bethlehem. 

\v 16 The Philistine drew near morning and evening and took his stand forty days. 

\v 17 And Jesse said to David his son, Take now for your brothers a bushel of this parched grain and these ten loaves and carry them quickly to the camp to your brothers. 

\v 18 But bring these ten cheeses to the commander of the thousand and look after your brothers' welfare and take a definite assurance from them. 

\v 19 Now Saul and they and all the men of Israel are in the valley of Elah fighting with the Philistines. 

\v 20 So David rose up early in the morning and left the flock with a keeper and went, as Jesse had commanded him. He came to the entrenchments just as the army was going forth to the battle-array, shouting the war cry. 

\v 21 Israel and the Philistines drew up the line of battle, army confronting army. 

\v 22 David left his vessels in the charge of the keeper of the baggage and ran to the line of battle and came and asked for the welfare of his brothers. 

\v 23 Just as he was talking with them, the champion, the Philistine of Gath, Goliath by name, came up out of the ranks of the Philistines and spoke the same words as before; and David heard them. 

\v 24 All the men of Israel, when they saw the man, fled from him and were greatly afraid. 

\v 25 The men of Israel said, Have you seen this man who has come up? Surely to insult Israel has he come up. Whoever smites him, the king will greatly enrich and will give him his daughter also and will make his father's house free in Israel. 

\v 26 Then David spoke to the men who stood by him, saying, What shall be done to the man who smites that Philistine and takes away the reproach from Israel? For who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that he has dared to insult the armies of the living God? 

\v 27 The people answered him in the words just given, saying, Thus shall it be done to the man who smites him. 

\v 28 But Eliab his eldest brother heard when he spoke to the men; and Eliab's anger was kindled against David, and he said, Why have you come down? With whom have you left those few sheep in the wilderness? I know you well and the wickedness of your heart; for to see the battle you have come down. 

\v 29 And David said, What have I now done? Is it not a matter of importance? 

\v 30 Turning away from him to another, he spoke as before; and the people answered him again as at the first time. 

\v 31 When the words were heard which David spoke, they reported them to Saul. They took him and brought him before Saul. 

\v 32 But David said to Saul, Let not my lord's courage fail him; your servant will go and fight with this Philistine. 

\v 33 And Saul said to David, you are not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him, for you are only a youth and he has been a warrior from his youth. 

\v 34 But David said to Saul, Your servant was a shepherd with his father's flock; and when a lion, or a bear would come and take a lamb out of the flock, 

\v 35 would go out after him and smite him and deliver it from his mouth; and if he rose up against me, I would seize him by his beard and slay him with a blow. 

\v 36 Your servant smote both lion and bear. Now this uncircumcised Philistine shall be like one of them, since he has insulted the armies of the living God. 

\v 37 David also said, the \nd Lord\nd* who delivered me from the paw of the lion, and from the paw of the bear, will deliver me from the hand of this Philistine. Therefore Saul said to David, Go, and may the \nd Lord\nd* be with you. 

\v 38 And Saul clothed David with his garments, and put a helmet of bronze on his head and clad him with a coat of mail. 

\v 39 And David girded his sword over his coat and made a vain attempt to go, for he had not tried them. Then David said to Saul, I cannot go with these for I have not tried them. And David put them off him. 

\v 40 He took his club in his hand, and chose five smooth stones out of the brook and put them in his bag, and took his sling in his hand, and he drew near to the Philistine. 

\v 41 But the Philistine kept coming nearer to David, and the man who was bearing the shield went before him. 

\v 42 When the Philistine looked and saw David, he despised him, for he was but a youth and ruddy, a young man of attractive appearance. 

\v 43 The Philistine said to David, Am I a dog that you come to me with a club? The Philistine cursed David by his gods. 

\v 44 The Philistine said to David, Come to me that I may give your flesh to the birds of the heavens and to the beasts of the field. 

\v 45 Then David answered the Philistine, You come to me with a sword and a spear and a javelin, But I come to you in the name of the \nd Lord\nd* of armies, and the God of the ranks of Israel whom you have insulted. 

\v 46 To-day the \nd Lord\nd* will deliver you into my hands, That I may smite you and cut off your head; and I will this day give the dead of the army of the Philistines to the birds of the heavens and to the wild beasts of the earth, that all the world may know that there is a God in Israel, 

\v 47 That all this assembly may know that not with the sword and spear doth the \nd Lord\nd* save, for the battle is the \nd Lord\nd*'s and he will give you into our hand. 

\v 48 Then when the Philistine arose and came and drew near to meet David, David quickly ran toward the line of battle to meet the Philistine. 

\v 49 David put his hand in his bag and took from it a stone and slung it and smote the Philistine on his forehead; and the stone sank into his forehead, so that he fell on his face to the earth. 

\v 50 And David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a stone and smote the Philistine, and slew him, although there was no sword in David's hand. 

\v 51 Then David ran and stood over the Philistine, and took his sword, and drew it out of its sheath,. and slew him, and cut off his head with it. When the Philistines saw that their champion was dead, they fled. 

\v 52 The men of Israel and Judah arose and raised the battle cry and pursued the Philistines to the entrance to Gath and to the gates of Ekron, so that the wounded of the Philistines fell down on the way from Shaaraim, even to Gath and Ekron. 

\v 53 When the Israelites returned from pursuing the Philistines, they plundered their camp, 

\v 54 but David took the head of the Philistine and brought it to Jerusalem; and he put his armor in his tent. 

\v 55 When Saul saw David going out against the Philistine, he said to Abner, the commander of the army, Abner, whose son is this lad? And Abner said, As you live, O king, I cannot tell. 

\v 56 The king said, Inquire whose son the young man is. 

\v 57 When David returned from smiting the Philistine, Abner took him, and brought him before Saul with the Philistine's head in his hand. 

\v 58 And Saul said to him, Whose son are you, my lad? And David answered, I am the son of your servant Jesse the Bethlehemite. 

\c 18 

\v 1 Now when David had ceased speaking with Saul, the soul of Jonathan was knit to the soul of David, and Jonathon loved him as his own life. 

\v 2 And Saul took him that day and would not let him return to his father's house. 

\v 3 And Jonathan made a covenant with David, because he loved him as his own life. 

\v 4 And Jonathan stripped himself of the cloak which he had on and gave it to David and his military coat, even to his sword and to his bow and to his girdle. 

\v 5 And David went out; in all for which Saul sent him, he acted wisely and with success, so that Saul appointed him over the warriors. He was beloved alike by all the people and by the servants of Saul. 

\v 6 Now when they came back, as David returned from slaying the Philistine, the women came out dancing from all the cities of Israel to meet Saul the king with tambourines, with cries of rejoicing, and with cymbals. 

\v 7 The women sang to each other as they danced, and said, Saul has slain his thousands,but David his ten thousands. 

\v 8 It made Saul very angry, and this saying displeased him and he said, They ascribed to David ten thousands, while to me they ascribed but thousands, and what can he have more but the kingdom? 

\v 8 And Saul kept his eye on David from that day forward. 

\v 12 And Saul was afraid of David, because the \nd Lord\nd* was with him and had departed from Saul. 

\v 13 Therefore Saul removed him from him, and made him his commander over a thousand; and he went out and came in at the head of the people. 

\v 14 And David acted wisely and prospered a in all his ways, for Jehovah was with him. 

\v 15 When Saul saw that he acted wisely and prospered, he stood in dread of him. 

\v 16 But all Israel and Judah loved David, for he went out and came in at their head. 

\v 17 And Saul said to David, See my oldest daughter, Merab, her will I give to you as wife; only be a valiant champion and fight the \nd Lord\nd*'s battles. For Saul said to himself, Let not my hand be upon him, but let the hand of the Philistines be upon him. 

\v 18 And David replied to Saul, Who am I, and what is my father's clan in Israel, that I should be the king's son-in-law? 

\v 19 But when the time came that Merab, Saul's daughter, should have been given to David, she was given as wife to Adriel e the Meholathite. 

\v 20 Michal, Saul's daughter, also loved David. When they told Saul, he was pleased. 

\v 21 And Saul said I will give her to him, that she a snare to him and that the hand of the Philistines may be upon him. Therefore Saul said to David, you shall this day be my son-in-law a second time. 

\v 22 So Saul commanded his servants, saying, Communicate with David secretly and say, `See, the king is pleased with you and all his servants love you; now therefore become the king's son-in-law.' 

\v 23 And Saul's servants spoke these words in the ears of David. And David said, Is it an easy thing in your opinion to become the king's son-in-law, when I am a poor man and of no reputation? 

\v 24 The servants of Saul told him saying, David spoke thus. 

\v 25 And Saul said, Thus shall you say to David, 'The king desires no bride-price, but a hundred foreskins of the Philistines, in order to take vengeance on the king's enemies.' But Saul thought to make David fall by the hand of the Philistines. 

\v 26 When his servants told David these words, David was well pleased with the prospect of being the king's son-in-law. The days were not yet expired; and David arose and went together with his men and slew of the Philistines a hundred men; and David brought their foreskins and paid them in full to the king, in order to become the king's son-in-law. Therefore Saul gave him Michal his daughter as wife. 

\v 28 When Saul saw and knew that the \nd Lord\nd* was with David and that all Israel loved him, 

\v 29 Saul feared David still more. 

\v 30 The princes of the Philistines went forth; and as often as they went forth, David acted more wisely and with greater success than all the servants of Saul, so that his name was held in high repute. 

\c 19 

\v 1 And Saul commanded Jonathan his son and all his servants to put David to death. But Jonathan, Saul's son, was very fond of David. 

\v 2 And Jonathan told David, saying, Saul my father is seeking to put you to death; now therefore, I pray you, take care in the morning and stay in concealment and hide yourself. 

\v 3 And I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where you are, and I will converse regarding you with my father, and whatever I see I will tell you. 

\v 4 And Jonathan spoke well of David to Saul his father, and said to him, Let not the king sin against his servant David, because he has not sinned against you and because his conduct toward you has been exceedingly good; for he took his life in his hand and smote the Philistine, and the \nd Lord\nd* wrought a great deliverance for Israel. You saw it and rejoiced. Why then will you sin against innocent blood, in slaying David without a cause? 

\v 6 And Saul harkened to the voice of Jonathan; and Saul gave an oath, As the \nd Lord\nd* liveth, he shall not be put to death. 

\v 7 And Jonathan called David, and Jonathan made known to him all these words. And Jonathan brought David to Saul, so that he was again in his presence as formerly. 

\v 8 But when there was war again, David went out and fought against the Philistines, and slew great numbers of them, so that they fled before him. 

\v 9 Then an evil spirit from the \nd Lord\nd* came upon Saul, while he was sitting in his house with his spear in his hand, and David was playing on the lyre. 

\v 10 And Saul sought to pin David to the wall with the spear, but he slipped away out of Saul's presence, so that he smote the spear into the wall, and David fled and escaped. 

\v 11 That night Saul sent messengers to David's house to watch him, so as to kill him in the morning. But Michal, David's wife, told him, saying, If you do not save your life to-night, to-morrow you will be slain. 

\v 12 Michal let David down through the window; and he fled away and escaped. 

\v 13 And Michal took the household god and laid it in the bed, and put a cloth of goat's hair for its head and covered it with the garment. 

\v 14 When Saul sent messengers to take David, she said, He is sick. 

\v 15 Then Saul sent the messengers to see David, saying, Bring him up to me in the bed, that I may put him to death. 

\v 16 When the messengers came in, there the household god was in the bed, with the cloth of goat's hair for its pillow. 

\v 17 And Saul said to Michal, Why have you deceived me thus, and let my enemy go, so that he has escaped? And Michal answered Saul, He said to me, 'Let me go; why should I kill you?' 

\v 18 Now David fled and escaped and came to Samuel to Ramah and told aSrintauel him all that Saul had done to mah him. He and Samuel went and remained in Naioth. 

\v 19 When it was told Saul, saying, David is there at Naioth in Ramah, 

\v 20 Saul sent messengers to take David. But when they saw the company of the prophets prophesying with Samuel standing as head over them, the spirit of God came upon the messengers of Saul, so that they also prophesied. 

\v 21 When it was told Saul, he sent other messengers, and they also prophesied. And Saul sent messengers again the third time, and they also prophesied. 

\v 22 Then Saul's anger was aroused and he himself went to Ramah. When he came to the cistern of the threshing floor, which is on the bare height, he asked, saying, Where are Samuel and David? One said, There they are at Naioth in Ramah. 

\v 23 But when he went thither to Naioth in Ramah, the spirit of God also came upon him, and he went along prophesying, until he came to Naioth in Ramah. 

\v 24 He also stripped off his clothes and prophesied before Samuel, and lay naked all that day and all that night. Therefore they say, Is Saul also among the prophets? 

\c 20 

\v 1 Then David came and said before Jonathan, What have I done? What is my guilt? What is my sin before your father, that he is seeking my life? 

\v 2 He replied to him, Far be it! You shall not die. See, my father does nothing great or small, but that he discloses it to than me; and why should my father hide this from me? Not so. 

\v 3 And David answered and said, Your father well knows that I have found favor in your eyes, and he is saying to himself, 'Let not Jonathan know this lest he be pained.' Nevertheless as surely as the \nd Lord\nd* liveth, and as you live, there is but a step between me and death. 

\v 4 Then Jonathan said to David, What do you desire to have me do for you? 

\v 5 And David answered Jonathan, Behold, to-morrow is the new moon and I should not fail to sit at the table with the king; therefore let me go and I will hide myself in the field until evening. 

\v 6 If your father misses me, then say, 'David urgently asked leave of me to run to Bethlehem his city; for the yearly sacrifice is there for all the family.' 

\v 7 If he says 'Good,' then it is well with your servant; but if it arouses his anger, then know that evil is determined upon by him. 

\v 8 Now deal kindly with your servant, for you have brought your servant into a sacred covenant with yourself; but if there be guilt in me, slay me yourself, for why should you bring me to your father? 

\v 9 And Jonathan said, Far be it from you! for if I should learn that my father had determined that evil should come upon you, I would tell you. 

\v 11 Then David said to Jonathan, Who will tell me, if your father answers me harshly? And Jonathan replied to David, Come, and let us go out into the field. So the two of them went out into the field. 

\v 12 And Jonathan said to David, the \nd Lord\nd*, the God of Israel, be witness that I will sound my father about this time to-morrow and if he be well disposed toward David, then I will send and disclose it to you. 

\v 13 God do to Jonathan whatever he will, should my father be disposed to do you evil, and I disclose it not to you and send you away that you may go in peace. May the \nd Lord\nd* be with you, as he has been with my father. 

\v 14 If I am yet alive, O may you show me the kindness of the \nd Lord\nd*! But if I should die, 

\v 15 may you never withdraw your kindness from my house. If, when the \nd Lord\nd* hath cut off the enemies of David, every one from the face of the earth, 

\v 16 the name of Jonathan should be cut off by the house of David, may the \nd Lord\nd* require it at the hand of David's enemies. 

\v 17 So Jonathan took oath again to David, because of his love to him; for with all his heart he loved him. 

\v 18 Then Jonathan said to him, To-morrow is the new moon and you will be missed, because your seat will be empty. 

\v 19 On the third day you will be greatly missed. Then you shall come to the place where you hid yourself on the day of the affair, and you shall sit down there beside the heap of stones. 

\v 20 On the third day I will shoot arrows on one side of it, as though I shot at a mark. 

\v 21 Then I will send the lad, saying, 'Go, find the arrows.' If I say to the lad, 'See, the arrows are on this side of you; pick them up!' --- then come; for it is well for you, and, as the \nd Lord\nd* liveth, there is nothing the matter. 

\v 22 But if I say to the boy, 'See, the arrows are beyond you,', go, for then the \nd Lord\nd* sends you away. 

\v 23 As to the word which you and I have spoken, behold, the \nd Lord\nd* is witness between you and me forever. 

\v 24 So David hid himself in the field; and when the new moon came, the king sat down at the table to eat. 

\v 25 The king sat upon his seat as usual, even on the seat by the wall, and Jonathan sat opposite, and Abner sat by Saul's side; but David's place was empty. 

\v 26 Nevertheless Saul did not say anything that day, for he thought, It is an accident, he is not ceremonially clean, for he has not been cleansed. 

\v 27 But when on the day following the new moon, David's place was empty, Saul said to Jonathan his son, Why has not the son of Jesse come to the meal, either yesterday or today? 

\v 28 And Jonathan answered Saul, David urgently asked leave of me to go to Bethlehem, 

\v 29 for he said, ' Let me go, since our family has a sacrifice in the city; and my brothers have commanded me. Now if I have found favor in your sight, let me slip away and see my kinsmen.' Hence he has not come to the king's table. 

\v 30 Then Saul's anger was kindled against Jonathan, and he said to him, Son of a depraved woman! Do I not know that you are associated withg the son of Jesse to your own shame and to the shame of your mother's nakedness? 

\v 31 For as long as the son of Jesse lives on the earth, neither you nor your kingdom will be established. Therefore now send and bring him to me, for he is doomed to die. 

\v 32 Then Jonathan answered Saul his father and said to him, Why should he be put to death? What has he done? 

\v 33 But Saul lifted up his spear at him to smite him. So Jonathan knew that his father had determined to put David to death. 

\v 34 Therefore Jonathan rose from the table in hot anger and ate no food the second day of the month, for he was grieved for David, because his father reviled him. 

\v 35 But in the morning Jonathan went out into the field at the time appointed with David, and a little lad with him. 

\v 36 He said to his lad, Run, find view now the arrows which I shoot. As the lad ran, he shot an arrow beyond him. 

\v 37 When the lad came to the place where the arrow which Jonathan had shot lay, Jonathan cried after the lad, and said, Is not the arrow beyond you? 

\v 38 And Jonathan cried after the lad, Hurry, quick, do not stop! So Jonathan's lad gathered up the arrows, and brought them to his master. 

\v 39 But the lad had no knowledge of anything; only Jonathan and David understood the matter. 

\v 40 And Jonathan gave his weapons to his lad, and said to him, Go, carry them to the city. 

\v 41 As soon as the lad had gone, David rose from beside the stone heap, and fell on his face to the ground and prostrated himself three times, and they kissed each other and wept at length with each other. 

\v 42 Then Jonathan said to David, Go in peace! As to what we two have sworn in the name of Jehovah—the \nd Lord\nd* will be between me and you and between my descendants and your descendants forever. Then David rose and departed and Jonathan went into the city. 

\c 21 

\v 1 And David came to Nob, to AhimeLech the priest. And Ahimelech came trembling to meet David and said to him, Why are you alone and no one with you? 

\v 2 And David answered Ahimelech the priest, The king has entrusted me with a matter and has said to me, ' Let no one know anything about the matter upon which I am sending you and which I have commanded you;' and I have directed the young men to meet me at a certain place. 

\v 3 Now, therefore, if you have five loaves of bread at hand, or whatever can be found,m give it to me. 

\v 4 The priest answered David, saying, There is no ordinary bread at hand, but there is holy bread, if only the young men have kept themselves from women.' 

\v 5 And David answered the priest and said to him, Of a truth women have been kept from us; as always when I set out on an expedition, the weapons of the young men were consecrated, though it is but an ordinary journey; how much more then today shall their weapons be holy! 

\v 6 So the priest gave him holy bread, for there was no bread there but the showbread, that was taken from before the \nd Lord\nd* in order to put hot bread there the day it was taken away. 

\v 7 Now one of the servants of Saul was there that day, detained before the \nd Lord\nd*, by the name of Doeg, an Edomite, the chief of Saul's herdsmen. 

\v 8 And David said to Ahimelech, Have you not here at hand a spear or sword? For I brought neither my sword nor my weapons with me, because the king's matter required haste. 

\v 8 The priest said, The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom you slew in the valley of Elah, there it is wrapped in a garment behind the ephod. If you wish to take that, take it, for there is no other except that here. And David said, There is none like that, give it to me. 

\v 10 Then David arose and fled that day from before Saul, and went to Achish the king of Gath. 

\v 11 The servants of Achish said to him, Is not this David the king of the land? Was it not of him that they used to sing responsively in the dances, saying, 

\q Saul has slain his thousands,
\q But David his ten thousands? 

\v 12 \nb And David took these words to his heart and was greatly afraid of Achish the king of Gath. 

\v 13 He pretended to be insane before them, and raved in their hands and drummed on the doors and let his spittle rund down upon his beard. 

\v 14 Then said Achish to his servants, You see plainly that the man is mad; why do you bring him to me? 

\v 15 Do I lack madmen that you have brought this fellow to act the madman in my presence? Should this one come into my house? 



\c 22 

\v 1 David therefore departed thence and escaped to the strongholds of Adullam. When his brethren and all his father's clan heard it, they went down there to him. 

\v 2 Every one who was in distress, and every one who was in debt, and every one who was embittered gathered about him, and he became their leader. There were with him about four hundred men. 

\v 3 And David went from there to Mizpeh in Moab; and he said to the king of Moab, Let my father and my mother dwell with you, until I know what God will do for me. 

\v 4 He left them in the presences of the king of Moab; and they dwelt with him all the while that David was in the stronghold. 

\v 5 The prophet Gad said to David, Do not remain in Mizpeh;d depart and come into the land of Judah. Then David departed and came into the forest of Hereth. 

\v 6 Now when Saul heard that David and the men with him were discovered (Saul was sitting in Gibeah, under the tamarisk-tree on the high place, with his spear in his hand, and all his servants were standing about him), 

\v 7 Saul said to his servants who were standing before him, Hear O Benjamites! Will the son of Jesse likewise give you all fields and vineyards? Will he make you all commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds, 

\v 8 that all of you have conspired against me, and no one discloses to me that my son has made a covenant with the son of Jesse, and none of you has pity g upon me or discloses to me that my son has stirred up my servant to be an enemy against me,h as is now the case? 

\v 9 Then Doeg the Edomite, who was standing by the servants of Saul, answered. and said, I saw the son of Jesse coming to Nob, to Ahimelech the son of Ahitub. 

\v 19 He inquired of Godi for him and gave him provisions and the sword of Goliath the Philistine. 

\v 11 Then the king summoned Ahimelech the priest, the son of Ahitub, and all his father's house, the priests who were in Nob, and they came all of them to the king. 

\v 12 And Saul said, Hear now, O son of Ahitub! He answered, Here am I, my lord! 

\v 13 And Saul said to him, Why have you, together with the son of Jesse, conspired against me, in that you have given him bread and a sword and have inquired of God for him, that he should rise against me as an enemy, as is now the case? 

\v 14 Then Ahimelech answered the king and said, But who among all your servants is like David, trusted and the king's son-in-law and captain over your retainer& and honored in your household? 

\v 15 Is this the first time I have inquired of God for him? Far be it from me! Let not the king impute anything to his servant nor to any one of my clan, for your servant did not know the slightest thing about all this. 

\v 16 But the king said, You shall surely die, Ahimelech, together with all your clan. 

\v 17 The king said to the runners who stood before him, Turn about and slay the priests of the \nd Lord\nd*, for their hand also was with David, and, although they knew that he was fleeing, they did not disclose it to me. But the servants of the king would not put forth their hands to strike down the priests of the \nd Lord\nd*. 

\v 18 Then the king said to Doeg, Turn and strike down the priests. And Doeg the Edomite turned and himself struck down the priests. So he slew on that day eighty-five men who wore the ephod. 

\v 19 The priestly city Nob he put to the sword, both men and women, children and infants, oxen and asses and sheep. 

\v 20 One of the sons of Ahimelech the son of Ahitub, named Abiathar, escaped and fled to David . 

\v 21 And Abiathar told David that Saul had slain the priests of the \nd Lord\nd*. 

\v 22 And David said to Abiathar, I knew that day, because Doeg the Edomite was there, that he would surely tell Saul. I myself am guilty of all the lives of your clan. 

\v 23 Remain with me, fear not; for whoever seeks your life must also seek mine, since you are placed in my charge. 



\c 23 

\v 1 Now when David was told, The Philistines are fighting against Keilah and are robbing the threshing floors, 

\v 2 David inquired of the \nd Lord\nd*, saying, Shall I go and attack these Philistines? And the \nd Lord\nd* said to David, Go, attack the Philistines, and save Keilah. 

\v 3 But David's men said to him, Behold we are afraid here in Judah; how much more then if we go to Keilah against the armies of the Philistines. 

\v 4 Then David inquired of the \nd Lord\nd* yet again. And the \nd Lord\nd* answered him, saying, Arise, go down to Keilah, for I will deliver the Philistines into thy hand. 

\v 5 So David and his men went to Keilah, and fought with the Philistines and drove away their cattle and slew a great many of them. Thus David delivered the inhabitants of Keilah. 

\v 6 Now when Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled to David to Keilah, he came down with the ephod in his hand. 

\v 7 When it was told Saul that David had come to Keilah, Saul said, God has sold him into my hand; for he has entrapped himself in entering into a town that has doors and bars. 

\v 8 And Saul summoned all the people to war, to go down to Keilah, to besiege David and his men. 

\v 9 When David knew that Saul was devising evil against him, he said to Abiathar the priest, Bring here the ephod. 

\v 10 And David said, O \nd Lord\nd*, the God of Israel, thy servant hath surely heard that Saul is seeking to come to Keilah, to destroy the city because of me. 

\v 11 Will Saul come down, as thy servant hath heard? O \nd Lord\nd*, God of Israel, I beseech thee, tell thy servant. And the \nd Lord\nd* said, He will come down. 

\v 12 Then David said, Will the men of Keilah deliver me and my men into the hand of Saul? And the \nd Lord\nd* said, They will deliver thee up. 

\v 13 Then David and his men, who were about six hundred, arose and departed from Keilah, and wandered hither and thither. When it was reported to Saul that David had escaped from Keilah, he abandoned his expedition. 

\v 14 So David dwelt in the wilderness in the strongholds and remained in the hill-country in the Wilderness of Ziph. And Saul sought him continually, but the \nd Lord\nd* did not deliver him into his hand. 

\v 15 Now David feared because Saul had come out to seek his life; and David was in the Wilderness of Ziph in Horesha. 

\v 16 And Jonathan, Saul's son, arose, and went to David in Horesha and strengthened his hand in God. 

\v 17 He said to him, Fear not, for the hand of Saul my father shall not find you, and you shall be king over Israel and I shall be next to you; and that also Saul my father well knows. 

\v 18 They two made a covenant before the \nd Lord\nd*; and David abode in Horesha, and Jonathan returned home. 

\v 19 Then the Ziphites came up to Saul to Gibeah, saying, Is not David hiding himself with us in the strongholds in Horesha, in the hill of Hachilah, which is to the south of the desert? 

\v 20 Now therefore, O king, according to all your heart's desire come down, and it shall be our part to deliver him into the king's hand. 

\v 21 Then Saul said, Blessed may you be of the \nd Lord\nd*, for you have had compassion on me. 

\v 22 Go, I pray, make yet more sure, and know and see the place where his haunt is and who has seen him there; for I am told that he is very cunning. 

\v 23 See therefore, and gain knowledge of all the lurking-places where he hides, and return to me, with sure information, and I will go with you, and, if he be in the land, I will search him out of all the thousands of Judah. 

\v 24 So they arose and went to Ziph before Saul. But David and his men were in the Wilderness of Maon, in the Arabah to the south of the desert. 

\v 25 When Saul and his men went to seek him, they told David and he went down to the rock which is in the Wilderness of Maon. When Saul heard, he pursued aftert David in the Wilderness of Maon. 

\v 26 And Saul went on the one side of the mountain and David and his men on the other side of the mountain; and David was anxiously trying to escape from Saul, for Saul and his men were about to surround David and his men, to seize them, 

\v 27 when a messenger came to Saul, saying, Come quickly, for the Philistines have made a raid upon the land. 

\v 28 So Saul returned from pursuing after David and went against the Philistines; therefore they called that place, Rock of Divisions. 

\v 29 And David went up thence, and dwelt in the strongholds of Engedi. 

\c 24 

\v 1 When Saul returned from following the Philistines, it was told him, saying, See, David is in the Wilderness of Engredi. 

\v 2 Then Saul took three thousand men chosen from all Israel and went to seek David and his men upon the Wild Goats' Crags. 

\v 3 He came to the sheepfolds by the way, and there was a cave. And Saul went in to cover his feet, while David and his men were staying in the recesses of the cave. 

\v 4 The men of David said to him, See this is the day of which the \nd Lord\nd* said to you, 'Behold, I give thine enemy into thy hand and thou shalt do to him as thou pleasest. Then David arose, and secretly cut off the skirt of Saul's mantle. 

\v 5 But afterward David Was seized with remorse because he had cut off Saul's skirt. 

\v 6 He said to his men, the \nd Lord\nd* forbid that I should do this thing to my lord, the \nd Lord\nd*'s anointed, to put forth my hand against him, since he is the \nd Lord\nd*'s anointed. 

\v 7 So David upbraided his men with these words, and did not permit them to attack Saul. When Saul rose from the cave and went on his way, 

\v 8 David also rose after him and went from the cave and cried after Saul, saying, My lord the king. When Saul looked behind him, David bowed his face to the earth, and did obeisance. 

\v 9 And David said to Saul, Why did you listen to the words of the men who said, 'See, David seeks your hurt? 

\v 10 To-day your eyes see that the \nd Lord\nd* gave you into my hand in the cave, but I refused to kill you and had pity on you, and I said, 'I will not put forth my hand against my lord, for he is the \nd Lord\nd*'s anointed.' 

\v 11 Moreover, my father, see the skirt of your mantle in my hand, for in that I cut off the skirt of your mantle and did not kill you, know and see that there is neither evil nor guilt on my hands, and I have not sinned against you, though you are aiming to take my life. 

\v 12 the \nd Lord\nd* judge between me and you; but my hand shall not be upon you. 

\v 13 As runs the proverb of the ancients, 

\q Out of the wicked cometh forth wickedness. 

\nb But my hand shall not be raised against you. 

\v 14 After whom is the king of Israel come out? After whom are you pursuing? After a dead dog? After a flea? 

\v 15 the \nd Lord\nd* therefore be judge and decide between me and you and see and plead my cause and obtain justice for me from you. 

\v 16 Now when David had finished speaking these words to Saul, Saul said, Is this not your voice, my son David? Then Saul lifted up his voice and wept. 

\v 17 He said to David, You are more righteous than I, for you have done to me that which is good, while I have done to you that which is evil. 

\v 18 You have done great good to me in that today, when the \nd Lord\nd* had shut me up in your hand, you did not kill me. 

\v 19 For when a man finds his enemy, does he send him on his way safe and sound? Therefore may the \nd Lord\nd* reward you richly for what you have done to me this day. 

\v 20 Now see, I know that you will surely be king, and that through you the kingdom of Israel shall be established. 

\v 21 Swear now therefore to me by the \nd Lord\nd*, that you will not cut off my descendants after me and that you will not destroy my name from my father's house. 

\v 22 So David took oath to Saul. And Saul went to his home; but David and his men went up to the stronghold. 

\c 25 

\v 1 Then David arose and went into the Wilderness of Maon. 

\v 2 There was a man in Maon, whose business was in Carmel. The man was very rich, and he had three thousand sheep and a thousand goats, and he was shearing his sheep in Carmel. 

\v 3 Now the man's name was Nabal; and his wife's name was Abigail; and the woman was sensible and comely, but the man was rough and ill-mannered; and he was a Calebite. 

\v 4 And David heard in the wilderness that Nabal was shearing his sheep. 

\v 5 And David sent ten young men, and David said to the young men, Go up to Carmel and enter Nabal's house and greet him in my name; 

\v 6 and you shall say to him and to his clan, 'Peace be to you and your house and all that you have. 

\v 7 Now I have heard that you have shearers. Your shepherds were with us, and we did not jeer at them, and nothing of theirs was missing all the while they were in Carmel. 

\v 8 Ask your young men and they will tell you. Therefore let the young men find favor in your eyes, for we have come on a feast day. Give, therefore, whatever you have at hand to your servants and to your son David.' 

\v 9 When David's young men came, they spoke to Nabal in the name of David and waited as directed. 

\v 10 Then Nabal answered David's servants, and said, Who is David? Who is the son of Jesse? Many are the slaves these days who break away, each from his master! 

\v 11 Should I then take my bread and my water and my meat that I have slain for my shearers, and give it to men of whom I know not whence they are? 

\v 12 So David's young men turned back on their way, and came and reported all these words to him. 

\v 13 And David said to his men, Let every man gird on his sword. They girded on each man his sword. And David also girded on his sword; and there went up after David about four hundred men; and two hundred remained with the baggage. 

\v 14 But one of the young men had told Abigail, Nabal's wife, saying, David has just sent messengers from the wilderness to salute our master, and he railed at them. 

\v 15 But the men have been very good to us and we have not been jeered at nor have we missed anything, as long as we went with them, when we were in the fields. 

\v 16 They were a wall about us both by night and by day all the while we were with them keeping the sheep. 

\v 17 Now therefore know and consider what you will do, for evil is determined against our master and against all his house, for he is such a base scoundrel that no one speak to him. 

\v 18 Then Abigail quickly took two hundred loaves of bread and two skins of wine and five roasted sheep and three and a third bushels of parched grain and a hundred bunches of raisins and two hundred cakes of figs and laid them on asses. 

\v 19 She said to her young men, Go on before me; see, I am coming after you. But she said nothing about it to her husband Nabal. 

\v 20 Just as she was riding on the ass and coming down under cover of the mountain, David and his men were also coming down toward her, so that she met them. 

\v 21 Now David had said, Surely for nothing did I guard all that belongs to this fellow in the wilderness, so that nothing of all that belongs to him was missing, for he has returned me evil for good. 

\v 22 God do whatever he will to David, if I leave by daybreak of all who belong to him as much as a single man. 

\v 23 When Abigail saw David, she alighted quickly from her ass and fell on her face before David and bowed to the ground. 

\v 24 She fell at his feet and said, Upon me, my lord, upon me be the guilt. Only let your maid-servant speak in your ears, and heed the words of your maid-servant speak in your ears, and heed the words of your maid-servant. 

\v 25 Let not my lord pay any attention to that base scoundrel, Nabal, for as his name is, so is he; "Reckless Fool," is his name and folly is his master; but your maid-servant saw not the young men of my lord, whom you sent. 

\v 26 Now my lord, as the \nd Lord\nd* liveth and as you live, since the \nd Lord\nd* has kept you from committing an act of bloodshed and from delivering yourself by your own hand--and may your enemies and those who seek to do evil to my lord be as Nabal-- 

\v 27 let this present, which your servant has brought to my lord, be given to the young men who follow my lord 

\v 28 Forgive, I pray the trespass of your maid-servant, for the \nd Lord\nd* will certainly make for my lord a secure house, for my lord is fighting the wars of the \nd Lord\nd*, and no evil shall be found in you as long as you live. 

\v 29 Should a man rise up to pursue you and to seek your life, the life of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of the living in the care of the \nd Lord\nd* your God, but the lives of your enemies will he sling out as from the hollow of a sling. 

\v 30 When the \nd Lord\nd* has done to my lord all the good that he has promised you and has made you prince over Israel, 

\v 31 then this shall not be a qualm or a burden on the conscience of my lord, that you have shed blood without cause or that my lord has delivered himself by his own hand. When the \nd Lord\nd* shall give prosperity to my lord, then remember your maid-servant. 

\v 32 And David said to Abigail, Blessed be the \nd Lord\nd*, the God of Israel, who sent you this day to meet me, 

\v 33 and blessed be your discretion, and blessed be you yourself, who have kept me this day from committing an act of bloodshed and from delivering myself by my own hand. 

\v 34 For as sure as the \nd Lord\nd*, the God of Israel, liveth, who hath kept me from doing you harm, except you had quickly come to meet me, surely there would not have been left to Nabal by daybreak so much as one man. 

\v 35 So David received from her hand that which she had brought him; and to her he said, Go up in peace to your house. See, I have heeded your advice, and granted your request. 

\v 36 But when Abigail came to Nabal, he was just having a banquet in his house, like a king. And Nabal's heart was merry within him, for he was very drunk, so that she did not tell him anything at all until day break. 

\v 37 But then in the morning when the effects of the wine were gone from Nabal, his wife told him these things, and his heart died within him and he became a stone. 

\v 38 At the end of about ten days the \nd Lord\nd* smote Nabal, so that he died. 

\v 39 Now when David heard tha Nabal was dead, he said, Blessed be the \nd Lord\nd* who hath avenged the case of my insult at the hand of Nabal and hath kept back his servant from evil; and the evil-doing of Nabal hath the \nd Lord\nd* brought back upon his own head. Thereupon David sent and wooed Abigail to take her to him to be his wife. 

\v 40 The servants of David came to Abigail at Carmel and said to her, David has sent us to you to take you to him to be his wife, she arose and bowed with her face to the earth and said, See, your slave is willing to be a maid-servant to wash the feet of my lord's servants. 

\v 42 Thereupon Abigail quickly arose and mounted an ass, and five maidens followed as servants. So she accompanied the messengers of David and became his wife. 

\v 43 David also took Ahinoam of Jezreel, and they both became his wives. 

\v 44 But Saul had given Michal his daughter, David's wife, to Palti the son of Laish to Gallim. 

\c 26 

\v 1 Then the Ziphites came to Saul at Gibeah, saying, Is not David hiding in the hill of Hachilah, which is east of the desert? 

\v 2 Accordingly Saul arose, and went down to the Wilderness of Ziph, having three thousand men of Israel with him, to seek David in the Wilderness of Ziph. 

\v 3 And Saul encamped in the hill of Hachilah, which is east of the desert on the way. But David remainsed in the wilderness. When he saw that Saul was pursuing him into the wilderness, 

\v 4 David sent out spies and learned that Saul had come from Keilah. 

\v 5 And David arose and came to the place where Saul had encamped. And David saw the place where Saul with Abner the son of Ner, the commander of his army lay, and Saul lay within the barricade, and the people were encamped around about him. 

\v 6 Then David spoke and said to Ahimelech the Hittite and to Abishai the son Zeruiah, Joab's brother, saying, Who will go down with me to Saul to the camp? And Abishai said, I will go down with you. 

\v 7 So David and abishai came to the people by night; and Saul was lying there asleep within the barricade, with his spear stuck into the earth at his head, with Abner and the people lying around about him. 

\v 8 Then Abishai said to David, God has delivered your enemy into your hand today. Now therefore let me smite him with his spear to the earth at one stroke, and I will not need to smile him twice! 

\v 9 But David said to Abishai, Destroy him not; for who can lay his hand upon the \nd Lord\nd*'s anointed and be innocent? 

\v 10 And David said, As the \nd Lord\nd* liveth, either the \nd Lord\nd* shall smite him, or his day shall come to die, or he shall go down into battle and be destroyed. 

\v 11 the \nd Lord\nd* forbid that I should put forth my hand against the \nd Lord\nd*'s anointed; but now take the spear that is at his head and the jug of water and let us go. 

\v 12 So David took the spear and the jug of water from Saul's head and they departed. No man saw it of knew it neither did any awake, for they were all asleep because a deep sleep from the \nd Lord\nd* had fallen upon them. 

\v 13 Then David went over to the other side and stood on the top of a mountain at a distance, a great space being between them. 

\v 14 And David cried to the people and to Abner, the son of Ner, saying, Do you make no answer Abner? Then Abner answered and said, Who are you that calls? 

\v 15 And David said to Abner, Are you not a man? Who is like you in Israel? Why then have you not kept guard over your lord the king? For one of the people came to destroy your lord. 

\v 16 This that you have done is not good. As the \nd Lord\nd* liveth, you are deserving death, because you have not kept watch over your lord, the \nd Lord\nd*'s anointed. Now see where the king's spear is and the jug of water that was at his head. 

\v 17 Then Saul recognized David's voice and said, Is this your voice, my son David? And David said, It is my voice, my lord, O king. 

\v 18 He said, Why is my lord pursuing his servant? For what have I done? Or of what kind of evil have I been guilty? 

\v 19 Now therefore let my lord the king hear the words of his servant. If the \nd Lord\nd* hath stirred you up against me, let him accept an offering; but if they be men, cursed be they before the \nd Lord\nd*, for they have driven me out today, so that I have no part in the inheritance of the \nd Lord\nd*, saying, 'Go serve other gods.' 

\v 20 Now therefore, may my blood not fall to the earth far away fromt the presence of the \nd Lord\nd*, for the king of Israel has come out to seek my life, as one hunts a partridge on the mountains. 

\v 21 Then Saul said, I have done wrong; return, my son David, for I will do you no more harm, because my life was regarded as sacred by you today. I have acted foolishly and have erred exceedingly. 

\v 22 And David answered and said, There is the king's spear! Let one of the young men come over and take it. 

\v 23 And the \nd Lord\nd* will reward each man's righteousness and fidelity; for the \nd Lord\nd* delivered you into my hand today, but I would not raise my hand against the \nd Lord\nd*'a anointed. 

\v 24 Just as your life was today of great value in my sight, so may my life be of great value in the \nd Lord\nd*'s sight, and let him deliver me out of all affliction. 

\v 25 Then Saul said to David, Be blessed, my son David; you shall do great things and shall surely succeed! So David went his way, but Saul returned to his place. 

\c 27 

\v 1 Then David said to himself, I shall be destroyed some day by the hand of Saul. There is nothing better for me than that I should escape into the land of the Philistines. Then Saul will despair of seeking me to longer in all the territory of Israel, and I will escape from his hand. 

\v 2 So David arose and and went over, together with the six hundred men who were with him, to Achish the son of Maoch, king of Gath. 

\v 3 And David dwelt with Achish at Gath, together with his men, each with his household, David with his two wives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess and Abigail the Carmelitess, Nabal's wife. 

\v 4 When Saul was informed that David had fled to Gath, he sought him no more. 

\v 5 But David Said to Achish, If now I have found favor in your sight, let a place in one of the towns in the open country be given me, that I may dwell there; for why should your servant dwell in the royal city with you? 

\v 6 Then Achish gave him Ziklag at that time; therefore Ziklag belongs to the kings of Judah to this day. 

\v 7 The length of the time that David dwelt in the open country of the Philistines was a year and four months. 

\v 8 And David and his men went up, and made a raid upon the Geshurites, the Girzites, and the Amalekites; for these tribes dwell in the land which extends from Telem as far as Shur, even to the land of Egypt. 

\v 9 As often as David smote the land, he did not leave alive man or woman, but taking the sheep, the oxen, the asses, the camels, and the clothing, he returned and came to Achish. 

\v 10 Then When Achish said, Where have you made a raid today? David answered, Against the South Country of Judah, or against the South Country of the Jerahmeelites and against the South Country of the Kenites. 

\v 11 But David never left alive man or woman, to bring them to Gath, for he thought, They might give information against us and say, 'Thus has David done.' Such was his custom all the while he dwelt in the open country of the Philistines. 

\v 12 And Achish trusted David, saying, He has brought himself into ill odor with his people Israel; therefore he shall be my servant forever. 

\c 28 

\v 1 Now in those days the Philistines assembled their forces to make a campaign against Israel. And Achish said to David, Be assured that you, together with your men, must go with me along with the forces. 

\v 2 And David said to Achish, Therefore you shall now know what your servant can do. And Achish said to David, Therefore I make you my bodyguard from this time on. 

\v 3 Now Samuel had died and all Israel had lamented for him and buried him in Ramah, his own city. And Saul had put the mediums and the wizards out of the land. 

\v 4 When the Philistines assembled and came and encamped in Shunem, Saul assembled all Israel, and they encamped in Gilboa. 

\v 5 When Saul saw the army of the Philistines, he was afraid and his heart was filled with apprehension. 

\v 6 And Saul inquired of the \nd Lord\nd*, but the \nd Lord\nd* did not answer him either by dreams or by Urim or by prophets. 

\v 7 Then Saul said to his servants, Find for me a medium who has a talisman that I may go to her and inquire of her. His servants said to him, Behold, there is at Endor a medium who has a talisman. 

\v 8 Therefore Saul disguised himself and put on other clothes and went, taking two men with him, and they came to the woman by night. He said, Divine for me by the talisman and bring up for me the one whom I shall name to you. 

\v 9 The woman said to him, Behold, you know what Saul has done, how he has cut off the mediums and the wizards from the land. Why then are you laying a snare for my life, to put me to death? 

\v 10 And Saul swore to her by the \nd Lord\nd*, saying, As the \nd Lord\nd* liveth, no guilt shall come upon you for this thing. 

\v 11 Then the woman said, Whom shall I bring up to you? He said, Bring up Samuel. 

\v 12 When the woman saw Samuel, she screamed. The woman said to Saul, Why have you deceived me, for you are Saul? 

\v 13 The king said to her, Do not be afraid! What do you see? The woman said to Saul, I see a god coming up out of the earth. 

\v 14 He said to her, What is his appearance? She said, An old man is coming up, and he is wrapped in a mantle. Then Saul knew that it was Samuel, and he bowed with his face to the earth and worshipped. 

\v 15 And Samuel said to Saul, Why have you disturbed me by bringing me up? And Saul answered, I am in great straits, for the Philistines are making war against me and God has turned from me and answers me no more, either by prophets or by dreams; so I have called you to tell me what I shall do. 

\v 16 And Samuel said, Why do you ask of me when the \nd Lord\nd* hath turned from you and become your adversary? 

\v 17 And the \nd Lord\nd* hath done to you as he declared by me; and the \nd Lord\nd* hath rent the kingdom out of your hand, and given it to your associate (David). 

\v 18 Because you did not heed the voice of the \nd Lord\nd*, and did not execute his fierce wrath upon Amalek, therefore the \nd Lord\nd* hath done this thing to you today. 

\v 19 To-morrow you and your sons with you shall fall; the \nd Lord\nd* will deliver the army of Israel also into the power of the Philistines. 

\v 20 Then Saul fell at once at full length upon the earth and was greatly afraid, because of the words of Samuel; also he had no strength in him, for he had not eaten bread during all the day and all the night. 

\v 21 When the woman came to Saul and saw that he was greatly troubled, she said to him, See, your maid-servant has heeded your voice, and I have taken my life in my hand and have listened to your words which you spoke to me. 

\v 22 Now therefore, listen also to the advice of your maid-servant and let me set before you a morsel of meat, and eat that you may have strength when you go on your way. 

\v 23 But he refused, and said, I will not eat. But his servants, together with the woman urged him, until he listened to their advice. So he rose from the earth and sat upon the couch. 

\v 24 The woman had a fatted calf in the house; and she quickly killed it, and took flour and kneaded it and baked from it unleavened bread. 

\v 25 She set it before Saul and his servants, and they ate. Then they rose up and went away that night. 

\c 29 

\v 1 The Philistines had assembled their forces at Aphek; and the Israelites encamped by the fountain in Jezreel. 

\v 2 The tyrants of the Philistines were marching past, with hundreds and with thousands; and David and his men marched in the rear guard with Achish. 

\v 3 Then the commanders of the Philistines said, What are these Hebrews? And Achish said to the commanders of the Philistines, This is David, the servant of Saul the king of Israel, who has now already been with me two years, and I have found no fault in him from the time that he came over to me to the present. 

\v 4 But the commanders of the Philistines were enraged against him, and said to him, Send back the man that he may return to the place where you have stationed him. Let him not go down with us to battle and let him not be in the camp an adversary to us; for with what could this fellow better ingratiate himself with his master than with the heads of these men? 

\v 5 Is not this David of whom they sang responsively in the dances, saying, 

\q Saul has slain his thousands,
\q But David his ten thousands? 

\v 6 \nb Then Achish called to David and said to him, As the \nd Lord\nd* liveth, you are upright, and it is my desire that you should go out and in with me in the camp; for I have found no evil in you from the time that you came to me to the present, but you are not regarded favorably by the tyrants. 

\v 7 Therefore now return and go in peace, that you may do nothing to displease the tyrants of the Philistines. 

\v 8 And David said to Achish, But what have I done? What have you found in your servant fromt the day that I entered into your service to this day, that I may not go and fight against the enemies of my lord the king? 

\v 9 And Achish answered and said to David, I know that you are as good in my sight as a Messenger of God, but the commanders of the Philistines have said, 'He shall not go up with us to the battle.' 

\v 10 Therefore now rise early in the morning, with the servants of your lord who came with you, and go to the place where I have stationed you, and do not entertain any evil design in your heart, for you are good in my sight, but rise early in the morning and as soon as it is light, depart. 

\v 11 So David rose early, together with his men, to depart in the morning to return to the land of the Philistines. The Philistines went up to Jezreel. 

\c 30 

\v 1 Now when David and his men on the third day came to Ziklag, the Amalekites had made a raid on the South Country and upon Ziklag, and had smitten Ziklag and burnt it with fire, 

\v 2 and had carried away captive the women and all who were in it, both small and great, without slaying any, and had carried them off and gone on their way. 

\v 3 When David and his men came to the city, there it was burned down, and their wives and their sons and their daughters had been taken captive. 

\v 4 Then David and the people who were with him wept aloud until they were no longer able to weep. 

\v 5 And David's two wives had been take captive, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite. 

\v 6 And David was in great straits, for the people spoke of stoning him, because the soul of all the people was embittered, each for his sons and for his daughters; but David strengthened himself in reliance on the \nd Lord\nd* his God. 

\v 7 And David said to Abiathar the priest, the son of Ahimelech, Bring here to me the ephod. And Abiathar brought thither the ephod to David. 

\v 8 And David inquired of the \nd Lord\nd*, saying, 

\q Shall I pursue this marauding band?

\q2 Shall I overtake them? 

\nb He answered him, 

\q Pursue,

\q2 For thou shalt surely overtake,

\q2 Thou shalt surely rescue. 

\v 9 \nb So David went, together with the six hundred men who were with him, and came to the Brook Besor, where those who were left behind remained. 

\v 10 But David pursued together with four hundred men; while two hundred remained behind, who were too faint to cross the Brook Besor. 

\v 11 They found an Egyptian in the field and brought him to David and gave him food to eat and water to drink; 

\v 12 and they gave him a piece of cake of figs, and two clusters of raisins. When he had eaten, his spirit revived, for he had eaten no bread and drunk no water for three days and nights. 

\v 13 And David said to him, To whom do you belong? Whence are you? He said I am an Egyptian lad, an Amalekite's servant, and my master abandoned me because three days ago I fell sick. 

\v 14 We made a raid upon the South Country of the Cherethites and upon that which belongs to Judah and upon the South Country of Caleb, and Ziklag we burned with fire. 

\v 15 And David said to him, Will you bring me down to this band? He said, Swear to me by God, that you will neither kill me nor deliver me into the hands of my master, and I will bring you down to this band. 

\v 16 When he had brought him down, there they were spread over all the land, eating and drinking and dancing, on account of all the great spoil that they had taken from the land of the Philistines and from the land of Judah. 

\v 17 And David smote them from twilight to evening in order to destroy them completely. None escaped except four hundred young men, who rode upon the camels and fled. 

\v 18 And David recovered all the persons whom the Amalekites had taken; and David rescued his two wives. 

\v 19 There was nothing of them missing either small or great, sons or daughters, spoil or anything that they had taken to themselves--David brought back all. 

\v 20 He took all the flocks and the herds and drove those animals before the people, and they said, This is David's spoil. 

\v 21 Now when David came to the two hundred men, who had been too faint to follow him, so that he had to leave them behind at the Brooks Besor, they went out to meet David, and the people who were with him. When they came near to the people, they saluted them. 

\v 22 Then all the wicked and base scoundrels among the men who went with David began to say, Because they did not go with us, we will not give them any of the spoil that we have recovered, except to each, his wife and his children, that he may take them away and depart. 

\v 23 But David said, Do not so, after that which the \nd Lord\nd* hath given us and after he hath preserved us and delivered the marauding band that came against us into our hand. 

\v 24 Who will give heed to you in this matter? For: 

\q As is the share of him who goes down into battle,

\q So is the share of him who remains with the baggage.

\q They shall share alike. 

\v 25 \nb From that time on he made it a statute and precedent in Israel to this day. 

\v 26 When David came to Ziklag, he sent some of the spoil to the elders of Judah, his friends, saying, See! a present for you from the spoil of the enemies of the \nd Lord\nd*, 

\v 27 to them who were in Bethel, in Ramoth in the South Country, in Jattir, 

\v 28 in Aroer, in Siphmoth, and to them who were in Eshtemoa, 

\v 29 in Carmel, in the cities of Jerahmeelites, in the cities of the Kenites, 

\v 30 in Hormah, Beersheba, in Athach, 

\v 31 in Hebron, and to those in all the places where David and his men had sojourned. 

\c 31 

\v 1 Now the Philistines fought against Israel, and the Israelites fled from before the Philistines and fell down slain on Mount Gilboa. 

\v 2 The Philistines followed close after Saul and his sons; and the Philistines slew Jonathan and Abinadab and Malchishua, the sons of Saul. 

\v 3 They pressed hard upon Saul, and the archers found him out, and he was wounded by the archers. 

\v 4 Then said Saul to his armorbearer, Draw your sword and run me through with it, lest these uncircumcised Philistines come and make sport of me. But his armorbearer would not, for he was greatly afraid. Therefore Saul took his own sword and fell upon it. 

\v 5 When his armorbearer saw that Saul was dead, he likewise fell upon his sword and died with him. 

\v 6 So Saul and his three sons and his armorbearer died together on the same day. 

\v 7 When the Israelites who were in the cities of the valley and in the cities of the Jordan saw that the Israelites had fled and that Saul and his sons were dead, they also left the cities and fled, and the Philistines came and remained in them. 

\v 8 But when on the following day the Philistines came to strip the slain, they found Saul and his three sons fallen on Mount Gilboa. 

\v 9 They cut off his head and stripped off his armor and sent throughout the land of the Philistines to bring good news to their idols and to the people. 

\v 10 They put his armor in the temple of Ashtarte, and they fastened his body on the wall of Bethshan. 

\v 11 When the inhabitants of Jabesh in Gilead heard what the Philistines had done to Saul, 

\v 12 all the valiant men arose and marched all night and took the bodies of Saul and his sons from the wall of Bethshan; and they came to Jabesh and lamendted over them there. 

\v 13 They took their bones and buried them under the tamarisk tree in Jabesh, and they fasted seven days.

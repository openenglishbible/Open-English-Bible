<span class="verse" rel="v034001002" id="001002" >2</span>
 The  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  tolerates no rivals. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  is vengeful and fierce in wrath. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; The  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  does not fail to punish his foes; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  is vengeful against his enemies. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v034001003" id="001003" >3</span>
 The  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  is slow to anger, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; great in power. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; The guilty will not escape <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; his punishment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Storm tempest is his path <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and cloud is the dust of his feet. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v034001004" id="001004" >4</span>
 He rebukes the sea and dries it up <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and makes all the streams run dry. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Bashan and Carmel are languishing <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and the bloom of Lebanon is withered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v034001005" id="001005" >5</span>
 The mountains tremble before him <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and the hills dissolve. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; The earth heaves before him, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the world and all who live in it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v034001006" id="001006" >6</span>
 Who can stand before his wrath? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who can withstand the heat of his anger? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; His fierce fury pours forth like fire, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he shatters rocks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v034001007" id="001007" >7</span>
 The  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  is good to those who hope in him, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a place of refuge in the day of trouble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v034001008" id="001008" >8</span>
 With rushing flood an end he makes <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of those who rise against him, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; he drives his enemies into darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v034001009" id="001009" >9</span>
 Why do you plot against the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He will end you. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He only takes vengeance once. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v034001010" id="001010" >10</span>
 Thorns, tangled and drenched, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; they are consumed like dry stubble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v034001011" id="001011" >11</span>
 Nineveh! From you has arisen <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; one who plots evil against the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a counsellor of wickedness. </p><h6>Good news for Judah</h6><p>
<span class="verse" rel="v034001012" id="001012" >12</span>
 The  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  says: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; “Though they are many and strong, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; they will pass away and be gone. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Though I have afflicted you, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will afflict you no more, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v034001013" id="001013" >13</span>
 and now I will break his yoke from your necks <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and snap your chains.” <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v034001014" id="001014" >14</span>
 The  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  has given this command concerning you, Nineveh: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; “Your name will no longer be remembered. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; I will destroy every idol and image <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in the house of your God. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; I will destroy even your tomb, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for you are worthless.” <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v034001015" id="001015" >15</span>
 Look! On the mountains a messenger <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bringing good news, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; announcing peace! <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; “Celebrate the feasts, Judah, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fulfill your vows. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Never again will these enemies invade your land, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; they are destroyed!” </p><h6>Destruction of the city</h6><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="chapter" id="002001">2</span> Nineveh! The destroyer has come up against you; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mount guard upon the rampart; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; watch the road; brace yourselves; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strengthen your might to the utmost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v034002002" id="002002" >2</span>
 For the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  is restoring the majesty of Jacob <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and of Israel, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; though the devastators have plundered them <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and destroyed their vines. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v034002003" id="002003" >3</span>
 The shields of his warriors are dyed red, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; his soldiers are clothed in scarlet, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; his chariots gleam like fire <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; on the day he prepares for battle <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; spears are shaken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v034002004" id="002004" >4</span>
 Chariots rush across the fields, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; storm through the squares; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; they flame like torches, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; they dart like lightening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v034002005" id="002005" >5</span>
 A leader rallies his nobles, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; they hurl themselves forward. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; They speed on toward the wall; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the storming-shield is set up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v034002006" id="002006" >6</span>
 The water-gates are thrown open, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and the palace dissolves in ruins. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v034002007" id="002007" >7</span>
 The queen is stripped, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; she is carried off. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Her maids moan like doves, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; beating upon their breasts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v034002008" id="002008" >8</span>
 Like a pool of water is Nineveh, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; her waters fast ebbing away. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; “Stand firm! Stand firm!” someone cries, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but no one turns back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v034002009" id="002009" >9</span>
 “Loot the silver, loot the gold, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for there is no end to the treasure, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the wealth and precious things.” <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v034002010" id="002010" >10</span>
 Nineveh is empty, desolate, devastated, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with faint heart and knocking knee. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; There is weakness in every limb, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and faces grow pale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v034002011" id="002011" >11</span>
 Where now is the den of lions? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where now the lair of their young? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Where the lion used to withdraw, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with his cubs, with none to disturb them? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v034002012" id="002012" >12</span>
 The lion tore enough for his cubs, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and strangled prey for his lionesses. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; He filled his caves with the kill, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he filled his lairs with fresh meat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v034002013" id="002013" >13</span>
 “But see, I am against you,” <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  of hosts declares, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; “I will burn your chariots in smoke and fire. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sword will devour your young lions. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; You will never again prey on the land. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No more will your messengers be heard.” </p><h6>Ruin</h6><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="chapter" id="003001">3</span> Woe to the bloody city! <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Full of lies and plunder, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; without end is the spoil. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v034003002" id="003002" >2</span>
 Hear the crack of the whip, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hear the rattle of wheels. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Galloping horses, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; jolting chariots. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v034003003" id="003003" >3</span>
 Horsemen charging, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; swords flashing, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; spears glittering, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; a multitude of slain, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a heap of bodies, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; no end to the corpses <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; over which people stumble! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v034003004" id="003004" >4</span>
 “Because you acted like a whore, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bewitching the nations, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; enticing the peoples, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v034003005" id="003005" >5</span>
 I am against you, Nineveh” <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  of hosts declares. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; “I will strip your clothes <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and show the nations your nakedness, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and the kingdoms your shame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v034003006" id="003006" >6</span>
 “I will fling loathsome filth at you, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and make you an object of contempt, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a spectacle, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v034003007" id="003007" >7</span>
 so that everyone who sees you <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; will flee from you and say: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; ‘Nineveh is laid waste, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; who will mourn for her?’ <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v034003008" id="003008" >8</span>
 “Are you any better than Thebes, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; which stood on the banks of the Nile, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; with waters around as a rampart, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; whose wall was the sea of waters? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v034003009" id="003009" >9</span>
 Her strength was Ethiopia and Egypt. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Libyans were her helpers, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and Put with its countless people. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v034003010" id="003010" >10</span>
 Yet she was exiled <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and made captive. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; On all corners of the streets <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; her infants were dashed to pieces. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Lots were cast for her nobles, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; all her great ones were bound in chains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v034003011" id="003011" >11</span>
 “You too, Nineveh, will be drunk with fear; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you too will seek a place of escape from the foe. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v034003012" id="003012" >12</span>
 All your fortresses are fig-trees with the first ripe figs; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if shaken, they fall into the mouth of the eater! <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v034003013" id="003013" >13</span>
 Your troops are weak as women before your foes; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the gates of your land are wide open; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; your defenses burned down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v034003014" id="003014" >14</span>
 “Draw water for the siege, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strengthen your forts. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Go to the clay pits and tread the clay; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; take up the brick moulds. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v034003015" id="003015" >15</span>
 There the fire will consume you, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the sword will cut you down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Multiply like the locust <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or a swarm of grasshoppers. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v034003016" id="003016" >16</span>
 Increase the numbers of your merchants <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; until they are more than the stars of heaven, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v034003017" id="003017" >17</span>
 until your watchmen are locusts, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and your scribes like grasshoppers, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; which swarm in the hedges on a cold day; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; but when the sun rises <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; they fly away, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; no one knows where. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v034003018" id="003018" >18</span>
 “King of Assyria: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; your princes slumber, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; your nobles sleep! <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Your people are scattered on the mountains <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with no one to gather them! <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v034003019" id="003019" >19</span>
 There is no healing for your hurt, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; your wound is incurable. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; All who hear of your fate clap their hands in joy, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for who has escaped your limitless cruelty?”

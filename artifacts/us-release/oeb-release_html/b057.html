<span class="verse" rel="v057001002" id="001002" >2</span>
 To our dear friend and fellow worker Philemon, to our sister Apphia, to our fellow soldier Archippus; and to the church that meets at Philemon’s house; 
<span class="verse" rel="v057001003" id="001003" >3</span>
 may God, our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ bless you and give you peace. </p><h6>Request regarding runaway slave</h6><p>
<span class="verse" rel="v057001004" id="001004" >4</span>
 I always mention you in my prayers and thank God for you, 
<span class="verse" rel="v057001005" id="001005" >5</span>
 because I hear of the love and the faith which you show, not only to the Lord Jesus, but also to all his people; 
<span class="verse" rel="v057001006" id="001006" >6</span>
 and I pray that your participation in the faith may result in action, as you come to a fuller realization of everything that is good and Christlike in us. 
<span class="verse" rel="v057001007" id="001007" >7</span>
 I have indeed found great joy and encouragement in your love, knowing, as I do, how the hearts of Christ’s People have been cheered, friend, by you. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v057001008" id="001008" >8</span>
 And so, though my union with Christ enables me, with all confidence, to dictate the course that you should adopt, 
<span class="verse" rel="v057001009" id="001009" >9</span>
 yet the claims of love make me prefer to plead with you – yes, even me, Paul, though I am an ambassador for Christ Jesus and, now a prisoner for him as well. 
<span class="verse" rel="v057001010" id="001010" >10</span>
 I plead with you for this child of mine, Onesimus, to whom, in my prison, I have become a father. 
<span class="verse" rel="v057001011" id="001011" >11</span>
 Once he was of little service to you, but now he has become of great service, not only to you, but to me as well; 
<span class="verse" rel="v057001012" id="001012" >12</span>
 and I am sending him back to you with this letter – though it is like tearing out of my heart. 
<span class="verse" rel="v057001013" id="001013" >13</span>
 For my own sake I should like to keep him with me, so that, while I am in prison for the good news, he might attend to my wants on your behalf. 
<span class="verse" rel="v057001014" id="001014" >14</span>
 But I do not wish to do anything without your consent, because I want your generosity to be voluntary and not, as it were, compulsory. 
<span class="verse" rel="v057001015" id="001015" >15</span>
 It may be that he was separated from you for an hour, for this reason, so that you might have him back for ever, 
<span class="verse" rel="v057001016" id="001016" >16</span>
 no longer as a slave, but as something better – a dearly loved friend and follower of the Lord, especially dear to me, and how much more so to you, not only as a person, but as your fellow Christian! 
<span class="verse" rel="v057001017" id="001017" >17</span>
 If, then, you count me your friend, receive him as you would me. 
<span class="verse" rel="v057001018" id="001018" >18</span>
 If he has caused you any loss, or owes you anything, charge it to me. 
<span class="verse" rel="v057001019" id="001019" >19</span>
 I, Paul, put my own hand to it – I will repay you myself. I say nothing about your owing me your self. 
<span class="verse" rel="v057001020" id="001020" >20</span>
 Yes, friend, let me gain something from you because of your union with the Lord. Cheer my heart by your Christlike spirit. <br /><br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v057001021" id="001021" >21</span>
 Even as I write, I have such confidence in your compliance with my wishes, that I am sure that you will do even more than I am asking. 
<span class="verse" rel="v057001022" id="001022" >22</span>
 Please also get a lodging ready for me, for I hope that I will be given back to you all in answer to your prayers. </p><h6>Messages and Blessing</h6><p>
<span class="verse" rel="v057001023" id="001023" >23</span>
 Epaphras, who is my fellow prisoner for Christ Jesus, sends you his greeting; 
<span class="verse" rel="v057001024" id="001024" >24</span>
 and Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my fellow workers, send theirs. <br /><br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v057001025" id="001025" >25</span>
 May the blessing of the Lord Jesus Christ rest on your souls. 
        </p></body>

<h1>Micah</h1>
<h6>The Superscription to Micah’s Sermons</h6>
<!-- 001 001 -->


<p class="smallcappara"><span class="chapter" id="001001">1</span><span class="dropcap">T</span>he  <span class="nd"> Lord </span> ’s message which came to Micah of Morsheth in the reigns of Jotham, Ahaz and Hezekiah, kings of Judah. The visions he saw about Samaria and Jerusalem. 
<h6>The Lord’s Judgment on Guilty Samaria and Judah</h6>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v033001002" id="001002" >2</span>
 Listen, all you peoples! 
<p class="indent1">  Pay attention, all you inhabitants of the earth! 
<p class="indent1">  For the Lord  <span class="nd"> God </span>  will be a witness against you, 
<p class="indent1">  the Lord from his holy temple! <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v033001003" id="001003" >3</span>
 The  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  is coming from his holy place, 
<p class="indent1">  he descends and treads on the heights of the earth, 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v033001004" id="001004" >4</span>
 so that the mountains melt beneath 
<p class="indent1">  like wax in the presence of the fire, 
<p class="indent1">  and the valleys break apart 
<p class="indent1">  like water poured down a steep descent. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v033001005" id="001005" >5</span>
 All this is because of the crime of Jacob, 
<p class="indent1">  and for the sin of the house of Israel. 
<p class="indent1">  What was the crime of Jacob? 
<p class="indent1">  Was it not Samaria? 
<p class="indent1">  What is the sin of Judah? 
<p class="indent1">  Is it not Jerusalem? <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v033001006" id="001006" >6</span>
 “I will make Samaria a ruin in an open field, 
<p class="indent1">  and a place where a vineyard is planted, 
<p class="indent1">  I will hurl down her stones into the valley, 
<p class="indent1">  and lay bare her foundations. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v033001007" id="001007" >7</span>
 “All her images will be shattered, 
<p class="indent1">  and all her statues will be burned with fire, 
<p class="indent1">  and all her idols I will lay in ruins. 
<p class="indent1">  For they were acquired by prostitution, 
<p class="indent1">  and to prostitution they will return.” <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v033001008" id="001008" >8</span>
 This is why I will mourn and wail, 
<p class="indent1">  I will go barefoot and naked, 
<p class="indent1">  I will howl like the jackals 
<p class="indent1">  and mourn like the desert owl. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v033001009" id="001009" >9</span>
 For the blow that Samaria has received is incurable. 
<p class="indent1">  It has spread over Judah, 
<p class="indent1">  it extends even to the gate of my people, 
<p class="indent1">  even to Jerusalem. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v033001010" id="001010" >10</span>
 Don’t tell this in Gath! 
<p class="indent1">  Don’t even cry – but sit in the dust at Beth-leaphrah. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v033001011" id="001011" >11</span>
 Pass by, inhabitants of Shaphir, naked and ashamed! 
<p class="indent1">  The inhabitants of Zaanan cannot leave their city. 
<p class="indent1">  Beth-ezel laments and removes its support from you. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v033001012" id="001012" >12</span>
 The inhabitants of Maroth wait anxiously for good! 
<p class="indent1">  But the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  has sent disaster to the gates of Jerusalem. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v033001013" id="001013" >13</span>
 Harness the horse to the chariot, inhabitants of Lachish. 
<p class="indent1">  You led the daughter of Zion, Jerusalem, into sin, 
<p class="indent1">  in you are found the crimes of Israel. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v033001014" id="001014" >14</span>
 Therefore you must give parting gifts to Moresheth-gath. 
<p class="indent1">  Beth-achzib will betray the kings of Israel. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v033001015" id="001015" >15</span>
 I will hand you to a conqueror, people of Mareshah, 
<p class="indent1">  the leaders of Israel will hide in Adullam Cave! 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v033001016" id="001016" >16</span>
 Shave your head in morning for the children you love, 
<p class="indent1">  until you are bald as vultures, because they have left you for exile. 
<h6>The Oppression of the Poor</h6>
<p class="indent1"><span class="chapter" id="002001">2</span> Woe to those who lie awake planning evil, 
<p class="indent1">  who in the light of morning carry out their plan 
<p class="indent1">  because they have the power to do it. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v033002002" id="002002" >2</span>
 They covet fields and seize them, 
<p class="indent1">  desire houses and take them, 
<p class="indent1">  they crush householder and his household, 
<p class="indent1">  people and their possessions. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v033002003" id="002003" >3</span>
 Therefore the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  says: 
<p class="indent1">  “I am planning disaster from which you cannot save your neck, 
<p class="indent1">  nor walk proudly because it will be a terrible time. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v033002004" id="002004" >4</span>
 On that day they will sing a taunt-song to you, 
<p class="indent1">  this mocking lament: 
<p class="indent1">  ‘My people’s estate is being measured for sale, 
<p class="indent1">  our captors are dividing our fields. 
<p class="indent1">  We are completely undone.’ 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v033002005" id="002005" >5</span>
 There will be no one to measure out land for you 
<p class="indent1">  from the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span> ’s community. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v033002006" id="002006" >6</span>
 “‘Don’t rant!’ they urge, ‘Of such things one does not prophesy! 
<p class="indent1">  Shame will not overtake us! 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v033002007" id="002007" >7</span>
 Is the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  impatient, or are such things his deeds? 
<p class="indent1">  Are not his words favorable to the family of Jacob?’ <p>
<p class="indent1">  Aren’t my commands good for those who obey them? 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v033002008" id="002008" >8</span>
 But you, you stand up as a foe against those who are peaceful; 
<p class="indent1">  you strip the robe from those who pass by quietly, averse to conflict. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v033002009" id="002009" >9</span>
 Women of my people you drive out from their happy homes, 
<p class="indent1">  from their young children you take away my glory forever. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v033002010" id="002010" >10</span>
 Rise and begone, for this is no place to rest. 
<p class="indent1">  Your uncleanness brings destruction, severe destruction. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v033002011" id="002011" >11</span>
 If a person walking in wine and falsehood were to say, 
<p class="indent1">  ‘I will prophesy to you of wine and strong drink,’ 
<p class="indent1">  then he would be the perfect prophet for this people!” 
<h6>The Lord Leading Back His Scattered People</h6>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v033002012" id="002012" >12</span>
 “I will assuredly assemble all of Jacob, 
<p class="indent1">  I will surely gather the survivors of Israel. 
<p class="indent1">  I will herd them together as sheep in a fold, 
<p class="indent1">  like a flock in the pasture, 
<p class="indent1">  and the land will resound with the sounds of multitudes. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v033002013" id="002013" >13</span>
 “The one who breaks out goes first. 
<p class="indent1">  They have broken forth and passed by the gate 
<p class="indent1">  and through it have they gone out. 
<p class="indent1">  Their king leads before them, 
<p class="indent1">  the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  at their head.” 
<h6>The Crimes of Judah’s Civil and Spiritual Leaders</h6>
<p class="indent1"><span class="chapter" id="003001">3</span> I also said: 
<p class="indent1">  “Listen now, leaders of Jacob, 
<p class="indent1">  judges of the house of Israel. 
<p class="indent1">  Is it not your duty to know what is the right? 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v033003002" id="003002" >2</span>
 Haters of that which is good and lovers of evil! <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v033003003" id="003003" >3</span>
 “They devour the flesh of my people, 
<p class="indent1">  and their hide they strip from off them, 
<p class="indent1">  and break in pieces and serve up their bones, 
<p class="indent1">  like meat in a pot or the cooking pan! <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v033003004" id="003004" >4</span>
 “Then they will cry out to the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, 
<p class="indent1">  but he will not pay attention to them. 
<p class="indent1">  He will hide his face from them at that time 
<p class="indent1">  because they have committed such crimes.” <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v033003005" id="003005" >5</span>
 Therefore the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  says: 
<p class="indent1">  “To the prophets who lead my people astray, 
<p class="indent1">  who when they have food between their teeth declare peace, 
<p class="indent1">  but against one who puts nothing in their mouths, 
<p class="indent1">  they proclaim an open war! <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v033003006" id="003006" >6</span>
 “Night will overtake you so that you have no vision, 
<p class="indent1">  and darkness so that there will be no divination, 
<p class="indent1">  and the sun will go down on the prophets, 
<p class="indent1">  and the day shall be dark over them. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v033003007" id="003007" >7</span>
 “The seers will be ashamed, 
<p class="indent1">  and the diviners will turn pale, 
<p class="indent1">  all of them will cover their mouths. 
<p class="indent1">  For there will be no answer from God. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v033003008" id="003008" >8</span>
 “But I, on the contrary am full of power, 
<p class="indent1">  and the sense of justice and strength, 
<p class="indent1">  to make known to Jacob his crime, 
<p class="indent1">  and to Israel his sin. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v033003009" id="003009" >9</span>
 “Hear this, leaders of the house of Jacob, 
<p class="indent1">  judges of the house of Israel, 
<p class="indent1">  you who spurn justice, 
<p class="indent1">  and make all that is straight crooked, 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v033003010" id="003010" >10</span>
 who build Zion with acts of bloodshed, 
<p class="indent1">  and Jerusalem with crime. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v033003011" id="003011" >11</span>
 “The leaders render judgment for a bribe, 
<p class="indent1">  and her priests give oracles for a reward, 
<p class="indent1">  and her prophets divine for silver. 
<p class="indent1">  Yet they claim to rely on the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, 
<p class="indent1">  ‘The  <span class="nd"> Lord </span> ’, they say, ‘is in our midst. 
<p class="indent1">  Evil cannot overtake us.’ <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v033003012" id="003012" >12</span>
 “Therefore for your sakes 
<p class="indent1">  Zion will be plowed as a field, 
<p class="indent1">  and Jerusalem will become a heap of ruins, 
<p class="indent1">  and the temple mount a wooded height.” 
<h6>The Peace and Worldwide Renown of Zion</h6>
<p class="indent1"><span class="chapter" id="004001">4</span> In the days to come 
<p class="indent1">  the mountain of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  will be established, 
<p class="indent1">  the house of our God on the top of the mountain, 
<p class="indent1">  lifted above the hills. <p>
<p class="indent1">  All the nations will flow to it, 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v033004002" id="004002" >2</span>
 and many peoples will go and say, 
<p class="indent1">  “Come, let us go up to the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span> ’s mount, 
<p class="indent1">  to the house of the God of Jacob, 
<p class="indent1">  so that he may instruct us in his ways, 
<p class="indent1">  so that we may walk in his paths.” 
<p class="indent1">  For from Zion proceeds instruction 
<p class="indent1">  and the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span> ’s word from Jerusalem. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v033004003" id="004003" >3</span>
 He will arbitrate between many peoples, 
<p class="indent1">  and render decisions for numerous nations, 
<p class="indent1">  They will beat their swords into ploughshares, 
<p class="indent1">  and their spears into pruning hooks. 
<p class="indent1">  Nation will not lift up sword against nation, 
<p class="indent1">  they will learn war no more. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v033004004" id="004004" >4</span>
 They will live each under his vine, 
<p class="indent1">  and under his fig tree, with none to terrify them. 
<p class="indent1">  For the mouth of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  of hosts has spoken. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v033004005" id="004005" >5</span>
 Each nation trusts in the names of their gods, 
<p class="indent1">  but we will worship the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  our God forever. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v033004006" id="004006" >6</span>
 “On that day,” says the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, 
<p class="indent1">  “I will assemble the lame. 
<p class="indent1">  I will gather exiles I punished. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v033004007" id="004007" >7</span>
 I will restore the lame as a remnant, 
<p class="indent1">  the exiles into a great nation. 
<p class="indent1">  The  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  will rule over them 
<p class="indent1">  on Mount Zion from that time forever.” 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v033004008" id="004008" >8</span>
 But you, watchtower for the flock, 
<p class="indent1">  hill of the daughter of Zion, 
<p class="indent1">  to you will return your former rule. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v033004009" id="004009" >9</span>
 So why do you now cry aloud? Haven’t you any king? 
<p class="indent1">  Or has your counselor perished, so you writhe in pain like a woman in labor? <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v033004010" id="004010" >10</span>
 Writhe and scream, daughter of Zion, like a woman in labor! 
<p class="indent1">  For now you must leave the city and camp in the open field. 
<p class="indent1">  You will be taken to Babylon, but there will be rescued. 
<p class="indent1">  There the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  will save you from the hands of your foes. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v033004011" id="004011" >11</span>
 But now many nations gather against you. 
<p class="indent1">  They say, “Let her be defiled, we will gloat over Zion.” 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v033004012" id="004012" >12</span>
 But they do not know the thoughts of the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>. 
<p class="indent1">  They do not understand his plan, 
<p class="indent1">  for he has gathered them like sheaves for the threshing floor. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v033004013" id="004013" >13</span>
 “Arise, thresh, daughter of Zion. 
<p class="indent1">  I will make your horns iron, 
<p class="indent1">  and your hoofs brass, 
<p class="indent1">  so you might beat in pieces many peoples, 
<p class="indent1">  and devote to the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  their spoil, 
<p class="indent1">  and their wealth to the ruler of all the earth. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="chapter" id="005001">5</span> “Now cut yourself in bitter grief, 
<p class="indent1">  daughter besieged by soldiers. 
<p class="indent1">  They have set a wall around you. 
<p class="indent1">  They strike the ruler of Israel, 
<p class="indent1">  in the face with a rod. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v033005002" id="005002" >2</span>
 “Bethlehem in Ephrathah, 
<p class="indent1">  small among the tribes of Judah, 
<p class="indent1">  from you will come a king 
<p class="indent1">  who will rule for me over Israel, 
<p class="indent1">  whose family line goes back to the distant past.” <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v033005003" id="005003" >3</span>
 So the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  will only abandon Israel to its enemies 
<p class="indent1">  until the woman in labor gives birth. 
<p class="indent1">  Then the survivors will be reunited with their own people. <p>

 And he will stand and shepherd by the strength of the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>,

<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v033005005" id="005005" >5</span>
 This will be our peace: 
<p class="indent1">  when Assyria comes into our land 
<p class="indent1">  and treads on our soil, 
<p class="indent1">  we will raise up against him seven shepherds, 
<p class="indent1">  eight leaders of men. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v033005006" id="005006" >6</span>
 They will shepherd Assyria with a sword, 
<p class="indent1">  and the land of Nimrod with bared blades. 
<p class="indent1">  They will deliver us from Assyria, 
<p class="indent1">  when they come into our land, 
<p class="indent1">  and tread within our borders. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v033005007" id="005007" >7</span>
 And the survivors of Jacob will be disbursed among the nations, 
<p class="indent1">  in the midst of many peoples, 
<p class="indent1">  like dew from the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, 
<p class="indent1">  like showers on the grass,

<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v033005008" id="005008" >8</span>
 And the survivors of Jacob will be disbursed among the nations, 
<p class="indent1">  in the midst of many peoples, 
<p class="indent1">  like a lion among the beasts of the forest, 
<p class="indent1">  like a young lion among the sheep-folds,

 Let your hand triumph over your adversaries, 
<p class="indent1">  let all your enemies be cut off. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v033005010" id="005010" >10</span>
 On that day, says the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>: 
<p class="indent1">  “I will slaughter your horses from your midst, 
<p class="indent1">  and destroy your chariots. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v033005011" id="005011" >11</span>
 I will devastate the cities in your land,

<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v033005013" id="005013" >13</span>
 I will cut down your idols and sacred pillars, 
<p class="indent1">  and you will not worship any more the work of your hands. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v033005014" id="005014" >14</span>
 I will uproot your sacred poles, 
<p class="indent1">  and destroy your idols. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v033005015" id="005015" >15</span>
 In my wrath and my anger

<h6>Israel’s False Conception of the Lord’s Character and Demands</h6>

<p class="indent1">  How have I displeased you? Answer me! 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v033006004" id="006004" >4</span>

<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v033006006" id="006006" >6</span>
 With what should I come before the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>? 
<p class="indent1">  Bow myself before the God on high? 
<p class="indent1">  Should I come before him with burnt-offerings, 
<p class="indent1">  with calves a year old? 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v033006007" id="006007" >7</span>
 Will the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  be pleased with thousands of rams,

 You will eat but not be satisfied,

 The honest have perished from the land,

<p class="indent1">  They hunt one another with the net. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v033007003" id="007003" >3</span>
 Their hands know well how to do evil,

 For son insults father,

 But I will look to the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>,

<p class="indent1">  My God will hear me! 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v033007008" id="007008" >8</span>
 Do not rejoice over me, my enemy.

 Who is a God like you, forgiving iniquity

<h2>The</h2>
<h2>Good News According to</h2>
<h1>John</h1>
<h6>Introduction</h6>
<!-- 001 001 -->


<p class="smallcappara"><span class="chapter" id="001001">1</span>
<p class="indent1"><span class="dropcap">I</span>n the beginning the Word was; 
<p class="indent2">  and the Word was with God; 
<p class="indent2">  and the Word was God. 
<!-- 001 001 -->


<p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v043001002" id="001002" >2</span>
 He was in the beginning with God; 
<p class="indent2"><span class="verse" rel="v043001003" id="001003" >3</span>
 through him all things came into being, 
<p class="indent2">  and nothing came into being apart from him. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v043001004" id="001004" >4</span>
 That which came into being in him was life; 
<p class="indent2">  and the life was the light of humanity; 
<p class="indent2"><span class="verse" rel="v043001005" id="001005" >5</span>
 and the light shines in the darkness, 
<p class="indent2">  and the darkness never overpowered it. 
<!-- 001 005 -->


<p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v043001006" id="001006" >6</span>
 There appeared a man sent from God, whose name was John; 
<p class="indent2"><span class="verse" rel="v043001007" id="001007" >7</span>
 he came as a witness – to bear witness to the light 
<p class="indent2">  so that through him everyone might believe. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v043001008" id="001008" >8</span>
 He was not the light, 
<p class="indent2">  but he came to bear witness to the light. 
<!-- 001 008 -->


<p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v043001009" id="001009" >9</span>
 That was the true light which enlightens everyone coming into the world. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v043001010" id="001010" >10</span>
 He was in the world; 
<p class="indent2">  and through him the world came into being – 
<p class="indent2">  yet the world did not know him. 
<!-- 001 010 -->


<p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v043001011" id="001011" >11</span>
 He came to his own – 
<p class="indent2">  yet his own did not receive him. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v043001012" id="001012" >12</span>
 But to all who did receive him he gave power to become children of God – 
<p class="indent2">  to those who believe in his name. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v043001013" id="001013" >13</span>
 For not to natural conception, nor to human instincts, nor to human will did they owe the new life, 
<p class="indent2">  but to God. 
<!-- 001 013 -->


<p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v043001014" id="001014" >14</span>
 And the Word became human, and lived among us, 
<p class="indent2">  (We saw his glory – the glory of the Only Son sent from the Father), 
<p class="indent2">  full of love and truth. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v043001015" id="001015" >15</span>
 (John bears witness to him; he cried aloud – for it was he who spoke – 
<p class="indent2">  “He who is coming after me is now before me, 
<p class="indent2">  for he was ever first”); 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v043001016" id="001016" >16</span>
 out of his fullness we have all received 
<p class="indent2">  gift after gift of love; 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v043001017" id="001017" >17</span>
 for the Law was given through Moses, 
<p class="indent2">  love and truth came through Jesus Christ. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v043001018" id="001018" >18</span>
 No one has ever yet seen God; 
<p class="indent2">  God the only Son, who is ever with the Father – 
<p class="indent1">  he has revealed him. 
<!-- 001 018 -->


<p>
<h6>The Preparation</h6>
<!-- 001 018 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043001019" id="001019" >19</span>
 When the religious authorities in Jerusalem sent some Priests and Levites to ask John – “Who are you?”, <span class="verse" rel="v043001020" id="001020" >20</span>
 he told them clearly and simply, “I am not the Christ.” 
<!-- 001 020 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043001021" id="001021" >21</span>
 “What then?” they asked. “Are you Elijah?” 
<!-- 001 021 -->


<p>  “No,” he said, “I am not.” 
<!-- 001 021 -->


<p>  “Are you ‘the prophet’?” He answered, “No.” 
<!-- 001 021 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043001022" id="001022" >22</span>
 “Who then are you?” they continued. “Tell us so that we have an answer to give to those who have sent us. What do you say about yourself?” 
<!-- 001 022 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043001023" id="001023" >23</span>
 “I,” he answered, “am – 
<p class="indent1">  ‘The voice of one crying aloud in the wilderness: make a straight road for the Lord’, <p>
<!-- 001 023 -->


<p>  as the prophet Isaiah said.” 
<!-- 001 023 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043001024" id="001024" >24</span>
 These men had been sent from the Pharisees; <span class="verse" rel="v043001025" id="001025" >25</span>
 and their next question was, “Why then do you baptize, if you are not the Christ or Elijah or ‘the prophet’?” <span class="verse" rel="v043001026" id="001026" >26</span>
 John’s answer was – “I baptize with water, but among you stands one whom you do not know; <span class="verse" rel="v043001027" id="001027" >27</span>
 he is coming after me, yet I am not worthy even to unfasten his sandal.” <span class="verse" rel="v043001028" id="001028" >28</span>
 This happened at Bethany, across the Jordan, where John was baptizing. 
<!-- 001 028 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043001029" id="001029" >29</span>
 The next day John saw Jesus coming towards him, and exclaimed, “Here is the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world! <span class="verse" rel="v043001030" id="001030" >30</span>
 I was talking about him when I said ‘After me there is coming a man who ranks ahead of me, because before I was born he already was.’ <span class="verse" rel="v043001031" id="001031" >31</span>
 I did not know who he was, but I have come baptizing with water to make him known to Israel.” <span class="verse" rel="v043001032" id="001032" >32</span>
 John also said: 
<!-- 001 032 -->


<p> “I saw the Spirit come down from heaven like a dove and rest on him. <span class="verse" rel="v043001033" id="001033" >33</span>
 I myself did not know him, but he who sent me to baptize with water, he said to me ‘He on whom you see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him – he it is who baptizes with the Holy Spirit.’ <span class="verse" rel="v043001034" id="001034" >34</span>
 This I have seen myself, and I have declared my belief that he is the Son of God.” <p>
<!-- 001 034 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043001035" id="001035" >35</span>
 The next day, when John was standing with two of his disciples, <span class="verse" rel="v043001036" id="001036" >36</span>
 he looked at Jesus as he passed and exclaimed, “There is the Lamb of God!” <span class="verse" rel="v043001037" id="001037" >37</span>
 The two disciples heard him say this, and followed Jesus. <span class="verse" rel="v043001038" id="001038" >38</span>
 But Jesus turned around, and saw them following.  <span class="woc"> “What are you looking for?” </span>  he asked. “Rabbi,” they answered (or, as we should say, ‘Teacher’), “where are you staying?” 
<!-- 001 038 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043001039" id="001039" >39</span>
<span class="woc"> “Come, and you will see,” </span>  he replied. So they went, and saw where he was staying, and spent that day with him. 
<!-- 001 039 -->


<p>  It was then about four in the afternoon. <span class="verse" rel="v043001040" id="001040" >40</span>
 One of the two, who heard what John said and followed Jesus, was Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother. <span class="verse" rel="v043001041" id="001041" >41</span>
 He first found his own brother Simon, and said to him, “We have found the Messiah!” (a word which means ‘Christ,’ or ‘Consecrated’.) <span class="verse" rel="v043001042" id="001042" >42</span>
 Then he brought him to Jesus. Looking straight at him, Jesus said,  <span class="woc"> “You are Simon, the son of John; you will be called Cephas” </span>  (which means ‘Peter,’ or ‘Rock’). <span class="verse" rel="v043001043" id="001043" >43</span>
 The following day Jesus decided to leave for Galilee. He found Philip, and said to him,  <span class="woc"> “Follow me.” </span><span class="verse" rel="v043001044" id="001044" >44</span>
 Philip was from Bethsaida, the same town as Andrew and Peter. <span class="verse" rel="v043001045" id="001045" >45</span>
 He found Nathanael and said to him, “We have found him of whom Moses wrote in the Law, and of whom the prophets also wrote – Jesus of Nazareth, Joseph’s son!” 
<!-- 001 045 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043001046" id="001046" >46</span>
 “Can anything good come out of Nazareth?” asked Nathanael. “Come and see,” replied Philip. <span class="verse" rel="v043001047" id="001047" >47</span>
 When Jesus saw Nathanael coming towards him, he said,  <span class="woc"> “Here is a true Israelite, in whom there is no deceit!” </span>
<!-- 001 047 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043001048" id="001048" >48</span>
 “How do you know me?” asked Nathanael.  <span class="woc"> “Even before Philip called you,” </span>  replied Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “when you were under the fig tree, I saw you.” </span>
<!-- 001 048 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043001049" id="001049" >49</span>
 “Rabbi,” Nathanael exclaimed, “you are the Son of God, you are king of Israel!” 
<!-- 001 049 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043001050" id="001050" >50</span>
<span class="woc"> “Do you believe in me,” </span>  asked Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “because I told you that I saw you under the fig tree? You will see greater things than those! </span><span class="verse" rel="v043001051" id="001051" >51</span>
<span class="woc"> In truth I tell you,” </span>  he added,  <span class="woc"> “you will all see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man.” </span>
<h6>The Work in Judaea, Galilee and Samaria</h6>
<!-- 002 051 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="002001">2</span> Two days after this there was a wedding at Cana in Galilee, and Jesus’ mother was there. <span class="verse" rel="v043002002" id="002002" >2</span>
 Jesus himself, too, with his disciples, was invited to the wedding. <span class="verse" rel="v043002003" id="002003" >3</span>
 And, when the wine ran short, his mother said to him, “They have no wine left.” 
<!-- 002 003 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043002004" id="002004" >4</span>
<span class="woc"> “What do you want with me?” </span>  answered Jesus.  <span class="woc"> “My time has not come yet.” </span><span class="verse" rel="v043002005" id="002005" >5</span>
 His mother said to the servants, “Do whatever he tells you.” <span class="verse" rel="v043002006" id="002006" >6</span>
 There were standing there six stone water-jars, in accordance with the Jewish rule of purification, each holding twenty or thirty gallons. 
<!-- 002 006 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043002007" id="002007" >7</span>
 Jesus said to the servants,  <span class="woc"> “Fill the water-jars with water.” </span><span class="verse" rel="v043002008" id="002008" >8</span>
 And, when they had filled them to the brim, he added,  <span class="woc"> “Now take some out, and carry it to the Master of the feast.” </span>  The servants did so. <span class="verse" rel="v043002009" id="002009" >9</span>
 And, when the Master of the feast had tasted the water which had now become wine, not knowing where it had come from – although the servants who had taken out the water knew – <span class="verse" rel="v043002010" id="002010" >10</span>
 He called the groom and said to him, “Everyone puts good wine on the table first, and inferior wine afterward, when his guests have drunk freely; but you have kept back the good wine till now!” <span class="verse" rel="v043002011" id="002011" >11</span>
 This, the first sign of his mission, Jesus gave at Cana in Galilee, and by it revealed his glory; and his disciples believed in him. <p>
<!-- 002 011 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043002012" id="002012" >12</span>
 After this, Jesus went down to Capernaum – he, his mother, his brothers, and his disciples; but they stayed there only a few days. <p>
<!-- 002 012 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043002013" id="002013" >13</span>
 Then, as the Jewish Passover was near, Jesus went up to Jerusalem. <span class="verse" rel="v043002014" id="002014" >14</span>
 In the Temple Courts he found people who were selling bullocks, sheep, and pigeons, and the money changers at their counters. <span class="verse" rel="v043002015" id="002015" >15</span>
 So he made a whip of cords, and drove them all out of the Temple Courts, and the sheep and bullocks as well; he scattered the money of the money changers, and overturned their tables, <span class="verse" rel="v043002016" id="002016" >16</span>
 and said to the pigeon-dealers,  <span class="woc"> “Take these things away. Do not turn my Father’s house into a market house.” </span><span class="verse" rel="v043002017" id="002017" >17</span>
 His disciples remembered that scripture said – ‘Passion for your house will consume me.’ 
<!-- 002 017 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043002018" id="002018" >18</span>
 Then some of the religious authorities asked Jesus, “What sign are you going to show us, since you act in this way?” 
<!-- 002 018 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043002019" id="002019" >19</span>
<span class="woc"> “Destroy this temple,” </span>  was his answer,  <span class="woc"> “and I will raise it in three days.” </span>
<!-- 002 019 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043002020" id="002020" >20</span>
 “This Temple,” the authorities replied, “has been forty-six years in building, and are you going to ‘raise it in three days’?” <span class="verse" rel="v043002021" id="002021" >21</span>
 But Jesus was speaking of his body as a temple. <span class="verse" rel="v043002022" id="002022" >22</span>
 Afterward, when he had risen from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this; and they believed the passage of scripture, and the words which Jesus had spoken. <p>
<!-- 002 022 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043002023" id="002023" >23</span>
 While Jesus was in Jerusalem, during the Passover Festival, many came to trust in him, when they saw the signs of his mission that he was giving. <span class="verse" rel="v043002024" id="002024" >24</span>
 But Jesus did not put himself in their power because he knew what was in their hearts. <span class="verse" rel="v043002025" id="002025" >25</span>
 He did not need anyone to tell him about people because he could read what was in them. <p>
<!-- 003 025 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="003001">3</span> Now there was a Pharisee named Nicodemus, who was a leading man among his people. <span class="verse" rel="v043003002" id="003002" >2</span>
 This man came to Jesus by night, and said to him, “Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher come from God; for no one could give such signs as you are giving, unless God were with him.” 
<!-- 003 002 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043003003" id="003003" >3</span>
<span class="woc"> “In truth I tell you,” </span>  exclaimed Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “unless a person is reborn, they cannot see the kingdom of God.” </span>
<!-- 003 003 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043003004" id="003004" >4</span>
 “How can a person,” asked Nicodemus, “be born when they are old? Can they be born a second time?”

<span class="woc"> “In truth I tell you,” </span>  answered Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “unless a person owes their birth to water and Spirit, they cannot enter the kingdom of God. </span><span class="verse" rel="v043003006" id="003006" >6</span>
<span class="woc"> All that owes its birth to human nature is human, and all that owes its birth to the Spirit is spiritual. </span><span class="verse" rel="v043003007" id="003007" >7</span>
<span class="woc"> Do not wonder at my telling you that you all need to be reborn. </span><span class="verse" rel="v043003008" id="003008" >8</span>
<span class="woc"> The wind blows wherever it wants, and you can hear the sound it makes, but you do not know where it comes from, or where it goes; it is the same with everyone who owes his birth to the Spirit.” </span>

 “How can that be?” asked Nicodemus. <span class="verse" rel="v043003010" id="003010" >10</span>
<span class="woc"> “What! You a teacher of Israel,” </span>  exclaimed Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “and yet do not understand this! </span><span class="verse" rel="v043003011" id="003011" >11</span>
<span class="woc"> In truth I tell you that we speak of what we know, and state what we have seen; and yet you do not accept our statements. </span><span class="verse" rel="v043003012" id="003012" >12</span>

<!-- 003 015 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043003016" id="003016" >16</span>
<span class="woc"> For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, so that everyone who believes in him may not be lost, but have eternal life. </span><span class="verse" rel="v043003017" id="003017" >17</span>
<span class="woc"> For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but so that the world might be saved through him. </span><span class="verse" rel="v043003018" id="003018" >18</span>
<span class="woc"> The person who believes in him escapes condemnation, while the person who does not believe in him is already condemned, because they have not believed in the only Son of God. </span><span class="verse" rel="v043003019" id="003019" >19</span>
<span class="woc"> The ground of their condemnation is this, that though the light has come into the world, people preferred the darkness to the light, because their actions were wicked. </span><span class="verse" rel="v043003020" id="003020" >20</span>
<span class="woc"> For the person who lives an evil life hates the light, and will not come to it, fearing that their actions will be exposed; </span><span class="verse" rel="v043003021" id="003021" >21</span>
<span class="woc"> but the person who lives by the truth comes into the light, so it can be clearly seen that God is in all they do. </span><p>

<p><span class="verse" rel="v043003022" id="003022" >22</span>
 After this, Jesus went with his disciples into the country parts of Judea; and there he stayed with them, and baptized. <span class="verse" rel="v043003023" id="003023" >23</span>
 John, also, was baptizing at Aenon near Salim, because there were many streams there; and people were constantly coming and being baptized. <span class="verse" rel="v043003024" id="003024" >24</span>
 (For John had not yet been imprisoned). <span class="verse" rel="v043003025" id="003025" >25</span>
 Now a discussion arose between some of John’s disciples and a fellow Jew on the subject of purification; <span class="verse" rel="v043003026" id="003026" >26</span>
 and the disciples came to John and said, “Rabbi, the man who was with you on the other side of the Jordan, and to whom you have yourself borne testimony – he, also, is baptizing, and everybody is going to him.” <span class="verse" rel="v043003027" id="003027" >27</span>
 John’s answer was – “A person can gain nothing but what is given them from heaven. <span class="verse" rel="v043003028" id="003028" >28</span>
 You are yourselves witnesses that I said ‘I am not the Christ,’ but ‘I have been sent before him as a messenger.’ <span class="verse" rel="v043003029" id="003029" >29</span>
 It is the groom who has the bride; but the groom’s friend, who stands by and listens to him, is filled with joy when he hears the groom’s voice. This joy I have felt to the full. <span class="verse" rel="v043003030" id="003030" >30</span>
 He must become greater, and I less.”

<p><span class="verse" rel="v043003031" id="003031" >31</span>
 He who comes from above is above all others; but a child of earth is earthly, and his teaching is earthly, too. He who comes from heaven is above all others. <span class="verse" rel="v043003032" id="003032" >32</span>
 He states what he has seen and what he heard, and yet no one accepts his statement. <span class="verse" rel="v043003033" id="003033" >33</span>
 They who did accept his statement confirm the fact that God is true. <span class="verse" rel="v043003034" id="003034" >34</span>
 For he whom God sent as his messenger gives us God’s own teaching, for God does not limit the gift of the Spirit. <span class="verse" rel="v043003035" id="003035" >35</span>
 The Father loves his Son, and has put everything in his hands. <span class="verse" rel="v043003036" id="003036" >36</span>
 The person who believes in the Son has eternal life, while a person who rejects the Son will not even see that life, but remains under God’s displeasure. <p>

<p><span class="chapter" id="004001">4</span> Now, when the Master heard that the Pharisees had been told that he was making and baptizing more disciples than John <span class="verse" rel="v043004002" id="004002" >2</span>
 (Though it was not Jesus himself, but his disciples, who baptized), <span class="verse" rel="v043004003" id="004003" >3</span>
 he left Judea, and set out again for Galilee. <span class="verse" rel="v043004004" id="004004" >4</span>
 He had to pass through Samaria, <span class="verse" rel="v043004005" id="004005" >5</span>
 and, on his way, he came to a Samaritan town called Shechem, near the plot of land that Jacob gave to his son Joseph. <span class="verse" rel="v043004006" id="004006" >6</span>
 Jacob’s Spring was there, and Jesus, being tired after his journey, sat down beside the spring, just as he was. It was then about midday. <span class="verse" rel="v043004007" id="004007" >7</span>
 A woman of Samaria came to draw water; and Jesus said to her –  <span class="woc"> “Give me some to drink,” </span><span class="verse" rel="v043004008" id="004008" >8</span>
 For his disciples had gone into the town to buy food. <span class="verse" rel="v043004009" id="004009" >9</span>
 “How is it,” replied the Samaritan woman, “that you who are a Jew ask for water from a Samaritan woman like me?” (For Jews do not associate with Samaritans). <span class="verse" rel="v043004010" id="004010" >10</span>
<span class="woc"> “If you knew of the gift of God,” </span>  replied Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “and who it is that is saying to you ‘Give me some water,’ you would have asked him, and he would have given you living water.” </span>
<!-- 004 010 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043004011" id="004011" >11</span>
 “You have no bucket, Sir, and the well is deep,” she said. “Where did you get that ‘living water?’ <span class="verse" rel="v043004012" id="004012" >12</span>
 Surely you are not greater than our ancestor Jacob who gave us the well, and used to drink from it himself, and his sons, and his cattle!” 
<!-- 004 012 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043004013" id="004013" >13</span>
<span class="woc"> “All who drink of this water,” </span>  replied Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “will be thirsty again; </span><span class="verse" rel="v043004014" id="004014" >14</span>
<span class="woc"> but whoever once drinks of the water that I will give him will never thirst any more; but the water that I will give him will become a spring welling up within him – a source of eternal life.” </span>
<!-- 004 014 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043004015" id="004015" >15</span>
 “Give me this water, Sir,” said the woman, “so that I may not be thirsty, nor have to come all the way here to draw water.” 
<!-- 004 015 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043004016" id="004016" >16</span>
<span class="woc"> “Go and call your husband,” </span>  said Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “and then come back.” </span>
<!-- 004 016 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043004017" id="004017" >17</span>
 “I have no husband,” answered the woman.  <span class="woc"> “You are right in saying ‘I have no husband,’” </span>  replied Jesus, <span class="verse" rel="v043004018" id="004018" >18</span>
<span class="woc"> “For you have had five husbands, and the man with whom you are now living is not your husband; in saying that, you have spoken the truth.” </span>
<!-- 004 018 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043004019" id="004019" >19</span>
 “I see, Sir, that you are a prophet!” exclaimed the woman. <span class="verse" rel="v043004020" id="004020" >20</span>
 “It was on this mountain that our ancestors worshiped; and yet you Jews say that the proper place for worship is in Jerusalem.” 
<!-- 004 020 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043004021" id="004021" >21</span>
<span class="woc"> “Believe me,” </span>  replied Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “a time is coming when it will be neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem that you will worship the Father. </span><span class="verse" rel="v043004022" id="004022" >22</span>
<span class="woc"> You Samaritans do not know what you worship; we know what we worship, for salvation comes from the Jews. </span><span class="verse" rel="v043004023" id="004023" >23</span>
<span class="woc"> But a time is coming, indeed it is already here, when the true worshipers will worship the Father spiritually and truly; for such are the worshipers that the Father desires. </span><span class="verse" rel="v043004024" id="004024" >24</span>
<span class="woc"> God is Spirit; and those who worship him must worship spiritually and truly.” </span>
<!-- 004 024 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043004025" id="004025" >25</span>
 “I know,” answered the woman, “that the Messiah, who is called the Christ, is coming; when once he has come, he will tell us everything.” 
<!-- 004 025 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043004026" id="004026" >26</span>
<span class="woc"> “I am he,” </span>  Jesus said to her,  <span class="woc"> “I who am speaking to you.” </span><span class="verse" rel="v043004027" id="004027" >27</span>
 At this moment his disciples came up, and were surprised to find him talking with a woman; but none of them asked ‘What do you want?’ or ‘Why are you talking with her?’ <span class="verse" rel="v043004028" id="004028" >28</span>
 So the woman, leaving her pitcher, went back to the town, and said to the people, <span class="verse" rel="v043004029" id="004029" >29</span>
 “Come and see someone who has told me everything that I have done. Can he be the Christ?” <span class="verse" rel="v043004030" id="004030" >30</span>
 And the people left the town and went to see Jesus. 
<!-- 004 030 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043004031" id="004031" >31</span>
 Meanwhile the disciples kept saying to him, “Take something to eat, Rabbi.” 
<!-- 004 031 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043004032" id="004032" >32</span>
<span class="woc"> “I have food to eat,” </span>  he answered,  <span class="woc"> “of which you know nothing.” </span>
<!-- 004 032 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043004033" id="004033" >33</span>
 “Can anyone have brought him anything to eat?” the disciples said to one another. <span class="verse" rel="v043004034" id="004034" >34</span>
<span class="woc"> “My food,” </span>  replied Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “is to do the will of him who sent me, and to complete his work. </span><span class="verse" rel="v043004035" id="004035" >35</span>
<span class="woc"> Don’t you say that it still wants four months to harvest? Why, look up, and see how white the fields are for harvest! </span><span class="verse" rel="v043004036" id="004036" >36</span>
<span class="woc"> Already the reaper is receiving wages and gathering in sheaves for eternal life, so that sower and reaper rejoice together. </span><span class="verse" rel="v043004037" id="004037" >37</span>
<span class="woc"> For here the proverb holds good – ‘One sows, another reaps.’ </span><span class="verse" rel="v043004038" id="004038" >38</span>
<span class="woc"> I have sent you to reap that on which you have spent no labor; others have labored, and you have reaped the results of their labor.” </span>
<!-- 004 038 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043004039" id="004039" >39</span>
 Many from that town came to believe in Jesus – Samaritans though they were – because the woman had said, ‘He has told me everything that I have done.’ <span class="verse" rel="v043004040" id="004040" >40</span>
 And, when these Samaritans had come to Jesus, they begged him to stay with them, and he stayed there two days. <span class="verse" rel="v043004041" id="004041" >41</span>
 But far more came to believe in him because of what he said himself, <span class="verse" rel="v043004042" id="004042" >42</span>
 and they said to the woman, “It is no longer because of what you say that we believe in him, for we have heard him ourselves and know that he really is the Savior of the world.” <p>
<!-- 004 042 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043004043" id="004043" >43</span>
 After these two days Jesus went on to Galilee; <span class="verse" rel="v043004044" id="004044" >44</span>
 for he himself declared that ‘a prophet is not honored in his own country.’ <span class="verse" rel="v043004045" id="004045" >45</span>
 When he entered Galilee, the Galileans welcomed him, for they had seen all that he did at Jerusalem during the Festival, at which they also had been present. <span class="verse" rel="v043004046" id="004046" >46</span>
 So Jesus came again to Cana in Galilee, where he had turned the water into wine. Now there was one of the king’s officers whose son was lying ill at Capernaum. <span class="verse" rel="v043004047" id="004047" >47</span>
 When this man heard that Jesus had returned from Judea to Galilee, he went to him, and begged him to come down and cure his son; for he was at the point of death. <span class="verse" rel="v043004048" id="004048" >48</span>
 Jesus answered,  <span class="woc"> “Unless you all see signs and wonders, you will not believe.” </span>
<!-- 004 048 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043004049" id="004049" >49</span>
 “Sir,” said the officer, “come down before my child dies.” And Jesus answered, “Go, your son is living.” <span class="verse" rel="v043004050" id="004050" >50</span>
 The man believed what Jesus said to him, and went; <span class="verse" rel="v043004051" id="004051" >51</span>
 and, while he was on his way down, his servants met him, and told him that his child was living. <span class="verse" rel="v043004052" id="004052" >52</span>
 So he asked them at what time the boy began to get better. “It was yesterday, about one o’clock,” they said, “that the fever left him.” <span class="verse" rel="v043004053" id="004053" >53</span>
 By this the father knew that it was at the very time when Jesus had said to him  <span class="woc"> ‘Your son is living’ </span> ; and he himself, with all his household, believed in Jesus. <span class="verse" rel="v043004054" id="004054" >54</span>
 This was the second occasion on which Jesus gave a sign of his mission on coming from Judea to Galilee. <p>
<!-- 005 054 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="005001">5</span> Sometime after this there was a Jewish Festival; and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. <span class="verse" rel="v043005002" id="005002" >2</span>
 There is in Jerusalem, near the sheep-gate, a bath with five colonnades around it. It is called in Hebrew ‘Bethesda.’ <span class="verse" rel="v043005003" id="005003" >3</span>
 In these colonnades a large number of sick people were lying – blind, lame, and crippled. <span class="verse" rel="v043005004" id="005004" >4</span>
<span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">       Some later manuscripts add: for an angel of the Lord went down at certain times into the pool, and stirred up the water. The first person to step in after the stirring of the water was healed of whatever disease they had. </span><span class="verse" rel="v043005005" id="005005" >5</span>
 One man who was there had been crippled for thirty-eight years. <span class="verse" rel="v043005006" id="005006" >6</span>
 Jesus saw the man lying there, and, finding that he had been in this state a long time, said to him,  <span class="woc"> “Do you wish to be cured?” </span>
<!-- 005 006 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043005007" id="005007" >7</span>
 “I have no one, Sir,” the sick man answered, “to put me into the bath when there is a troubling of the water, and, while I am getting to it, someone else steps down before me.” 
<!-- 005 007 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043005008" id="005008" >8</span>
<span class="woc"> “Stand up,” </span>  said Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “take up your mat, and walk.” </span><span class="verse" rel="v043005009" id="005009" >9</span>
 The man was cured immediately, and took up his mat and began walking. <span class="verse" rel="v043005010" id="005010" >10</span>
 Now it was the Sabbath. So the religious authorities said to the man who had been cured, “This is the Sabbath; you must not carry your mat.” 
<!-- 005 010 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043005011" id="005011" >11</span>
 “The man who cured me,” he answered, “said to me  <span class="woc"> ‘Take up your mat and walk.’” </span>
<!-- 005 011 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043005012" id="005012" >12</span>
 “Who was it,” they asked, “that said to you  <span class="woc"> ‘Take up your mat and walk’?” </span><span class="verse" rel="v043005013" id="005013" >13</span>
 But the man who had been restored did not know who it was; for Jesus had moved away, because there was a crowd there. <span class="verse" rel="v043005014" id="005014" >14</span>
 Afterward Jesus found the man in the Temple Courts, and said to him,  <span class="woc"> “You are cured now; do not sin again, or something worse may happen to you.” </span>
<!-- 005 014 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043005015" id="005015" >15</span>
 The man went away, and told the authorities that it was Jesus who had cured him. <span class="verse" rel="v043005016" id="005016" >16</span>
 And that was why they began to persecute Jesus – because he did things of this kind on the Sabbath. <span class="verse" rel="v043005017" id="005017" >17</span>
 But Jesus replied,  <span class="woc"> “My Father works to this very hour, and I work also.” </span><span class="verse" rel="v043005018" id="005018" >18</span>
 This made the authorities all the more eager to kill him, because not only was he doing away with the Sabbath, but he actually called God his own Father – putting himself on an equality with God. 
<!-- 005 018 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043005019" id="005019" >19</span>
 So Jesus made this further reply,  <span class="woc"> “In truth I tell you, the Son can do nothing of himself; he does only what he sees the Father doing; whatever the Father does, the Son does also. </span><span class="verse" rel="v043005020" id="005020" >20</span>
<span class="woc"> For the Father loves his Son, and shows him everything that he is doing; and he will show him still greater things – so that you will be filled with wonder. </span><span class="verse" rel="v043005021" id="005021" >21</span>
<span class="woc"> For, just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, so also the Son gives life to whom he pleases. </span><span class="verse" rel="v043005022" id="005022" >22</span>
<span class="woc"> The Father himself does not judge any one, but has entrusted the work of judging entirely to his Son, </span><span class="verse" rel="v043005023" id="005023" >23</span>
<span class="woc"> so that everyone may honor the Son, just as they honor the Father. The person who does not honour the Son fails to honour the Father who sent him. </span><span class="verse" rel="v043005024" id="005024" >24</span>
<span class="woc"> In truth I tell you that the person who listens to my message and believes him who sent me, has eternal life, and does not come under condemnation, but has already passed out of death into life. </span><span class="verse" rel="v043005025" id="005025" >25</span>
<span class="woc"> In truth I tell you that a time is coming, indeed it is already here, when the dead will listen to the voice of the Son of God, and when those who listen will live. </span><span class="verse" rel="v043005026" id="005026" >26</span>
<span class="woc"> For, just as the Father has inherent life within him, so also he has granted to the Son to have inherent life within him; </span><span class="verse" rel="v043005027" id="005027" >27</span>

<p><span class="chapter" id="006001">6</span> After this, Jesus crossed the Sea of Galilee – otherwise called the Lake of Tiberias. <span class="verse" rel="v043006002" id="006002" >2</span>
 A great crowd of people, however, followed him, because they saw the signs of his mission in his work among those who were sick. <span class="verse" rel="v043006003" id="006003" >3</span>
 Jesus went up the hill, and sat down there with his disciples. <span class="verse" rel="v043006004" id="006004" >4</span>
 It was near the time of the Jewish Festival of the Passover. <span class="verse" rel="v043006005" id="006005" >5</span>
 Looking up, and noticing that a great crowd was coming towards him, Jesus said to Philip,  <span class="woc"> “Where are we to buy bread for these people to eat?” </span><span class="verse" rel="v043006006" id="006006" >6</span>
 He said this to test him, for he himself knew what he meant to do. <span class="verse" rel="v043006007" id="006007" >7</span>
 “Even if we spent a years’ wages on bread,” answered Philip, “it would not be enough for each of them to have a little.”

<p><span class="verse" rel="v043006008" id="006008" >8</span>
 “There is a boy here,” said Andrew, another of his disciples, Simon Peter’s brother, <span class="verse" rel="v043006009" id="006009" >9</span>
 “Who has five barley loaves and two fish; but what is that for so many?” 
<!-- 006 009 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043006010" id="006010" >10</span>
<span class="woc"> “Make the people sit down,” </span>  said Jesus. It was a grassy spot; so the people, who numbered about five thousand, sat down, <span class="verse" rel="v043006011" id="006011" >11</span>
 and then Jesus took the loaves, and, after saying the thanksgiving, distributed them to those who were sitting down; and the same with the fish, giving the people as much as they wanted. <span class="verse" rel="v043006012" id="006012" >12</span>
 When they were satisfied, Jesus said to his disciples,  <span class="woc"> “Collect the broken pieces that are left, so that nothing may be wasted.” </span><span class="verse" rel="v043006013" id="006013" >13</span>
 The disciples did so, and filled twelve baskets with the pieces of the five barley loaves, which were left after all had eaten. 
<!-- 006 013 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043006014" id="006014" >14</span>
 When the people saw the signs which Jesus gave, they said, “This is certainly the prophet who was to come into the world.” <span class="verse" rel="v043006015" id="006015" >15</span>
 But Jesus, having discovered that they were intending to come and carry him off to make him king, went again up the hill, quite alone. 
<!-- 006 015 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043006016" id="006016" >16</span>
 When evening fell, his disciples went down to the sea, <span class="verse" rel="v043006017" id="006017" >17</span>
 and, getting into a boat, began to cross to Capernaum. By this time darkness had set in, and Jesus had not yet come back to them; <span class="verse" rel="v043006018" id="006018" >18</span>
 the sea, too, was getting rough, for a strong wind was blowing. <span class="verse" rel="v043006019" id="006019" >19</span>
 When they had rowed three or four miles, they caught sight of him walking on the water and approaching the boat, and they were frightened. <span class="verse" rel="v043006020" id="006020" >20</span>
 But Jesus said to them,  <span class="woc"> “It is I; do not be afraid!” </span><span class="verse" rel="v043006021" id="006021" >21</span>
 And after this they were glad to take him into the boat; and the boat at once arrived off the shore, for which they had been making. <p>
<!-- 006 021 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043006022" id="006022" >22</span>
 The people who remained on the other side of the sea had seen that only one boat had been there, and that Jesus had not gone into it with his disciples, but that they had left without him. <span class="verse" rel="v043006023" id="006023" >23</span>
 Some boats, however, had come from Tiberias, from near the spot where they had eaten the bread after the Master had said the thanksgiving. <span class="verse" rel="v043006024" id="006024" >24</span>
 So, on the next day, when the people saw that Jesus was not there, or his disciples either, they themselves got into the boats, and went to Capernaum to look for him. <span class="verse" rel="v043006025" id="006025" >25</span>
 And, when they found him on the other side of the sea, they said, “When did you get here, Rabbi?” 
<!-- 006 025 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043006026" id="006026" >26</span>
<span class="woc"> “In truth I tell you,” </span>  answered Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “it is not because of the signs which you saw that you are looking for me, but because you had the bread to eat and were satisfied. </span><span class="verse" rel="v043006027" id="006027" >27</span>
<span class="woc"> Work, not for the food that perishes, but for the food that lasts for eternal life, which the Son of Man will give you; for on him the Father – God himself – has set the seal of his approval.” </span>

<p><span class="verse" rel="v043006028" id="006028" >28</span>
 “How,” they asked, “are we to do the work that God wants us to do?” 
<!-- 006 028 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043006029" id="006029" >29</span>
<span class="woc"> “The work that God wants you to do,” </span>  answered Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “is to believe in him whom God sent as his messenger.” </span>
<!-- 006 029 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043006030" id="006030" >30</span>
 “What sign, then,” they asked, “are you giving, which we may see, and so believe you? What is the work that you are doing? <span class="verse" rel="v043006031" id="006031" >31</span>
 Our ancestors had the manna to eat in the desert; as scripture says – ‘He gave them bread from heaven to eat.’”

<!-- 006 033 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043006034" id="006034" >34</span>

<span class="woc"> and his will is this – that I should not lose one of all those whom he has given me, but should raise them up at the Last day. </span><span class="verse" rel="v043006040" id="006040" >40</span>
<span class="woc"> For it is the will of my Father that everyone who sees the Son, and believes in him, should have immortal life; and I myself will raise him up at the Last day.” </span>
<!-- 006 040 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043006041" id="006041" >41</span>
 The people began murmuring against Jesus for saying –  <span class="woc"> ‘I am the bread which came down from heaven.’ </span><span class="verse" rel="v043006042" id="006042" >42</span>
 “Is not this Jesus, Joseph’s son,” they asked, “whose father and mother we know? How is it that he now says that he has come down from heaven?” 
<!-- 006 042 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043006043" id="006043" >43</span>
<span class="woc"> “Do not murmur among yourselves,” </span>  said Jesus in reply. <span class="verse" rel="v043006044" id="006044" >44</span>
<span class="woc"> “No one can come to me, unless the Father who sent me draws him to me; and I will raise him up at the Last day. </span><span class="verse" rel="v043006045" id="006045" >45</span>
<span class="woc"> It is said in the prophets – ‘And they will all be taught by God.’ Everyone who is taught by the Father and learns from him comes to me. </span><span class="verse" rel="v043006046" id="006046" >46</span>
<span class="woc"> Not that anyone has seen the Father, except him who is from God – he has seen the Father. </span><span class="verse" rel="v043006047" id="006047" >47</span>
<span class="woc"> In truth I tell you, the person who believes in me has eternal life. </span><span class="verse" rel="v043006048" id="006048" >48</span>

<!-- 006 051 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043006052" id="006052" >52</span>
 They began disputing with one another, “How is it possible for this man to give us his flesh to eat?” 
<!-- 006 052 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043006053" id="006053" >53</span>
<span class="woc"> “In truth I tell you,” </span>  answered Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man, and drink his blood, you have not life within you. </span><span class="verse" rel="v043006054" id="006054" >54</span>

<span class="woc"> That is the bread which has come down from heaven – not such as your ancestors ate, and yet died; the person who takes this bread for their food will live for ever.” </span>
<!-- 006 058 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043006059" id="006059" >59</span>
 All this Jesus said in a synagogue, when he was teaching in Capernaum. <span class="verse" rel="v043006060" id="006060" >60</span>
 On hearing it, many of his disciples said, “This is harsh doctrine! Who can bear to listen to it?” <span class="verse" rel="v043006061" id="006061" >61</span>
 But Jesus, aware that his disciples were murmuring about it, said to them, <span class="verse" rel="v043006062" id="006062" >62</span>
<span class="woc"> “Is this a hindrance to you? What, then, if you should see the Son of Man ascending where he was before? </span><span class="verse" rel="v043006063" id="006063" >63</span>
<span class="woc"> It is the Spirit that gives life; human strength achieves nothing. In the teaching that I have been giving you there is Spirit and there is life. </span><span class="verse" rel="v043006064" id="006064" >64</span>
<span class="woc"> Yet there are some of you who do not believe in me.” </span>  For Jesus knew from the first who they were that did not believe in him, and who it was that would betray him; <span class="verse" rel="v043006065" id="006065" >65</span>
 and he added,  <span class="woc"> “This is why I told you that no one can come to me, unless enabled by the Father.” </span><span class="verse" rel="v043006066" id="006066" >66</span>
 After this many of his disciples drew back, and did not go about with him any longer. <span class="verse" rel="v043006067" id="006067" >67</span>
 So Jesus said to the Twelve,  <span class="woc"> “Do you also wish to leave me?” </span><span class="verse" rel="v043006068" id="006068" >68</span>
 But Simon Peter answered, “Master, to whom would we go? Eternal life is in your teaching; <span class="verse" rel="v043006069" id="006069" >69</span>
 and we have learned to believe and to know that you are the Holy One of God.” 
<!-- 006 069 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043006070" id="006070" >70</span>
<span class="woc"> “Didn’t I myself choose you to be the Twelve?” </span>  replied Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “and yet, even of you, one is playing the devil’s part.” </span><span class="verse" rel="v043006071" id="006071" >71</span>
 He meant Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot, who was about to betray him, though he was one of the Twelve. <p>
<!-- 007 071 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="007001">7</span> After this, Jesus went about in Galilee, for he would not do so in Judea, because the religious authorities (in Jerusalem) were eager to put him to death. <span class="verse" rel="v043007002" id="007002" >2</span>
 When the Jewish Festival of Tabernacles was near, <span class="verse" rel="v043007003" id="007003" >3</span>
 his brothers said to him, “Leave this part of the country, and go into Judea, so that your disciples, as well as we, may see the work that you are doing. <span class="verse" rel="v043007004" id="007004" >4</span>
 For no one does a thing privately, if they are seeking to be widely known. Since you do these things, you should show yourself publicly to the world.” <span class="verse" rel="v043007005" id="007005" >5</span>
 For even his brothers did not believe in him. 
<!-- 007 005 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043007006" id="007006" >6</span>
<span class="woc"> “My time,” </span>  answered Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “is not come yet, but your time is always here. </span><span class="verse" rel="v043007007" id="007007" >7</span>
<span class="woc"> The world cannot hate you, but it does hate me, because I testify that its ways are evil. </span><span class="verse" rel="v043007008" id="007008" >8</span>
<span class="woc"> Go yourselves up to the Festival; I am not going to this Festival yet, because my time has not yet come.” </span><span class="verse" rel="v043007009" id="007009" >9</span>
 After telling them this, he stayed on in Galilee. 
<!-- 007 009 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043007010" id="007010" >10</span>
 But, when his brothers had gone up to the Festival, Jesus also went up – not publicly, but privately. <span class="verse" rel="v043007011" id="007011" >11</span>
 The authorities were looking for him at the Festival and asking ‘Where is he?’; <span class="verse" rel="v043007012" id="007012" >12</span>
 and there were many whispers about him among the people, some saying ‘He is a good man;’ others, ‘No! He is leading the people astray.’ <span class="verse" rel="v043007013" id="007013" >13</span>
 No one, however, spoke freely about him, because they were afraid of the authorities. <p>
<!-- 007 013 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043007014" id="007014" >14</span>
 About the middle of the Festival week, Jesus went up into the Temple Courts, and began teaching. <span class="verse" rel="v043007015" id="007015" >15</span>
 The authorities were astonished. “How has this man got his learning,” they asked, “when he has never studied?” <span class="verse" rel="v043007016" id="007016" >16</span>
 So, in reply, Jesus said,  <span class="woc"> “My teaching is not my own; it is his who sent me. </span><span class="verse" rel="v043007017" id="007017" >17</span>
<span class="woc"> If anyone has the will to do God’s will, they will find out whether my teaching is from God, or whether I speak on my own authority. </span><span class="verse" rel="v043007018" id="007018" >18</span>
<span class="woc"> The person who speaks on their own authority seeks honor for themselves; but the one who seeks the honor of him who sent him is sincere, and there is nothing false in him. </span><span class="verse" rel="v043007019" id="007019" >19</span>
<span class="woc"> Was not it Moses who gave you the Law? Yet not one of you obeys it! Why are you seeking to put me to death?” </span>
<!-- 007 019 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043007020" id="007020" >20</span>
 “You must be possessed by a demon!” the people exclaimed. “Who is seeking to put you to death?” 
<!-- 007 020 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043007021" id="007021" >21</span>
<span class="woc"> “There was one thing I did,” </span>  replied Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “at which you are all still wondering. </span><span class="verse" rel="v043007022" id="007022" >22</span>
<span class="woc"> But that is why Moses has instituted circumcision among you – not, indeed, that it began with him, but with our ancestors – and that is why you circumcise even on a Sabbath. </span><span class="verse" rel="v043007023" id="007023" >23</span>
<span class="woc"> When a man receives circumcision on a Sabbath to prevent the Law of Moses from being broken, how can you be angry with me for making a man sound and well on a Sabbath? </span><span class="verse" rel="v043007024" id="007024" >24</span>
<span class="woc"> Do not judge by appearances; judge justly.” </span><span class="verse" rel="v043007025" id="007025" >25</span>
 At this some of the people of Jerusalem exclaimed, “Is not this the man who they are seeking to put to death? <span class="verse" rel="v043007026" id="007026" >26</span>
 Yet here he is, speaking out boldly, and they say nothing to him! Is it possible that our leading men have really discovered that he is the Christ? <span class="verse" rel="v043007027" id="007027" >27</span>
 Yet we know where this man is from; but, when the Christ comes, no one will be able to tell where he is from.” <span class="verse" rel="v043007028" id="007028" >28</span>
 Therefore, Jesus, as he was teaching in the Temple Courts, raised his voice and said,  <span class="woc"> “Yes; you know me and you know where I am from. Yet I have not come on my own authority, but he who sent me may be trusted; and him you do not know. </span><span class="verse" rel="v043007029" id="007029" >29</span>
<span class="woc"> I do know him, for it is from him that I have come, and he sent me as his messenger.” </span><span class="verse" rel="v043007030" id="007030" >30</span>
 So they sought to arrest him; but no one touched him, for his time was not come yet. <span class="verse" rel="v043007031" id="007031" >31</span>
 Many of the people, however, believed in him. “When the Christ comes,” they said, “will he give more signs of his mission than this man has given?” <span class="verse" rel="v043007032" id="007032" >32</span>
 The Pharisees heard the people whispering about him in this way, and so the chief priests and the Pharisees sent officers to arrest him; <span class="verse" rel="v043007033" id="007033" >33</span>
 at which Jesus said,  <span class="woc"> “I will be with you but a little longer, and then I am going to him who sent me. </span><span class="verse" rel="v043007034" id="007034" >34</span>
<span class="woc"> You will look for me, and you will not find me; and you will not be able to come where I will be.” </span>
<!-- 007 034 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043007035" id="007035" >35</span>
 “Where is this man going,” the people asked one another, “that we would not find him? Will he go to our countrymen abroad, and teach foreigners? <span class="verse" rel="v043007036" id="007036" >36</span>
 What does he mean by saying  <span class="woc"> ‘You will look for me, and you will not find me; and you will not be able to come where I will be’?” </span><p>
<!-- 007 036 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043007037" id="007037" >37</span>
 On the last and greatest day of the Festival, Jesus, who was standing by, exclaimed,  <span class="woc"> “If anyone is thirsty, they should come to me and drink. </span><span class="verse" rel="v043007038" id="007038" >38</span>
<span class="woc"> From the heart of those who believe in me will flow, as is said in scripture, rivers of living water.” </span><span class="verse" rel="v043007039" id="007039" >39</span>
 (By this he meant the Spirit, which those who had believed in him were to receive; for the Spirit had not yet come, because Jesus had not yet been exalted.) <span class="verse" rel="v043007040" id="007040" >40</span>
 Some of the people, when they heard these words, said, “This is certainly the Prophet!”; <span class="verse" rel="v043007041" id="007041" >41</span>
 others said, “the Christ!”; but some asked, “What! Does the Christ come from Galilee? <span class="verse" rel="v043007042" id="007042" >42</span>
 Is not it said in scripture that it is of the descendants of David, and from Bethlehem, the village to which David belonged, that the Christ is to come?” <span class="verse" rel="v043007043" id="007043" >43</span>
 So there was a sharp division among the people because of Jesus. <span class="verse" rel="v043007044" id="007044" >44</span>
 Some of them wanted to arrest him, and yet no one touched him. <span class="verse" rel="v043007045" id="007045" >45</span>
 When the officers returned to the chief priests and Pharisees, they were asked, “Why have you not brought him?” 
<!-- 007 045 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043007046" id="007046" >46</span>
 “No one ever spoke as he speaks!” they answered. <span class="verse" rel="v043007047" id="007047" >47</span>
 “What! Have you been led astray too?” the Pharisees replied. <span class="verse" rel="v043007048" id="007048" >48</span>
 “Have any of our leading men believed in him, or any of the Pharisees? <span class="verse" rel="v043007049" id="007049" >49</span>
 As for these people who do not know the Law – they are cursed!” <span class="verse" rel="v043007050" id="007050" >50</span>
 But one of their number, Nicodemus, who before this had been to see Jesus, said to them, <span class="verse" rel="v043007051" id="007051" >51</span>
 “Does our Law pass judgment on a person without first giving them a hearing, and finding out what they have been doing?” 
<!-- 007 051 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043007052" id="007052" >52</span>
 “Are you also from Galilee?” they retorted. “Search, and you will find that no prophet is to arise in Galilee!” <p>
<!-- 007 052 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043007053" id="007053" >53</span>
 And everyone went home <span class="chapter" id="008001">8</span> except Jesus, who went to the Mount of Olives <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">       This passage is inserted in some manuscripts from an ancient source, and found either after John 7:53 or after Luke 21:38 or elsewhere. </span> . <span class="verse" rel="v043008002" id="008002" >2</span>
 But he went again into the Temple Courts early in the morning, and all the people came to him; and he sat down and taught them. <span class="verse" rel="v043008003" id="008003" >3</span>
 Presently, however, the Teachers of the Law and the Pharisees brought a woman who had been caught in adultery, and placed her in the middle of the Court, <span class="verse" rel="v043008004" id="008004" >4</span>
 and said to Jesus, “Teacher, this woman was found in the act of adultery. <span class="verse" rel="v043008005" id="008005" >5</span>
 Now Moses, in the Law, commanded us to stone such women to death; what do you say?” 
<!-- 008 005 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043008006" id="008006" >6</span>
 They said this to test him, in order to have a charge to bring against him. But Jesus stooped down, and wrote on the ground with his finger. <span class="verse" rel="v043008007" id="008007" >7</span>
 However, as they continued asking him, he raised himself, and said, “Let the person among you who has never done wrong throw the first stone at her.” 
<!-- 008 007 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043008008" id="008008" >8</span>
 And again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground. <span class="verse" rel="v043008009" id="008009" >9</span>
 When they heard that, they went out one by one, beginning with the eldest; and Jesus was left alone with the woman in the middle of the Court. <span class="verse" rel="v043008010" id="008010" >10</span>
 Raising himself, Jesus said to her, “Woman, where are they? Did no one condemn you?” 
<!-- 008 010 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043008011" id="008011" >11</span>
 “No one, Sir,” she answered. 
<!-- 008 011 -->


<p>  “Neither do I condemn you,” said Jesus “go, and do not sin again.” <p>
<!-- 008 011 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043008012" id="008012" >12</span>
 Jesus again addressed the people.  <span class="woc"> “I am the light of the world,” </span>  he said.  <span class="woc"> “The person who follows me will not walk in darkness, but will have the light of life.” </span>
<!-- 008 012 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043008013" id="008013" >13</span>
 “You are bearing testimony to yourself!” exclaimed the Pharisees, “your testimony is not trustworthy.” 
<!-- 008 013 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043008014" id="008014" >14</span>
<span class="woc"> “Even if I bear testimony to myself,” </span>  answered Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “my testimony is trustworthy; for I know where I came from, and where I am going; but you do not know where I come from, nor where I am going. </span><span class="verse" rel="v043008015" id="008015" >15</span>
<span class="woc"> You judge by appearances; I judge no one. </span><span class="verse" rel="v043008016" id="008016" >16</span>
<span class="woc"> Yet, even if I were to judge, my judgment would be trustworthy; because I am not alone, but the Father who sent me is with me. </span><span class="verse" rel="v043008017" id="008017" >17</span>
<span class="woc"> Why, in your own Law it is said that the testimony of two persons is trustworthy. </span><span class="verse" rel="v043008018" id="008018" >18</span>
<span class="woc"> I, who bear testimony to myself, am one, and the Father who sent me also bears testimony to me.” </span><span class="verse" rel="v043008019" id="008019" >19</span>
<span class="woc"> “Where is your father, then?” </span>  they asked.  <span class="woc"> “You know neither me nor my Father,” </span>  replied Jesus.  <span class="woc"> “If you had known me, you would have also known my Father.” </span><span class="verse" rel="v043008020" id="008020" >20</span>
 These statements Jesus made in the Treasury, while teaching in the Temple Courts. Yet no one arrested him, for his time had not then come. <p>
<!-- 008 020 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043008021" id="008021" >21</span>
 Jesus again spoke to the people.  <span class="woc"> “I am going away,” </span>  he said,  <span class="woc"> “and you will look for me, but you will die in your sin; you cannot come where I am going.” </span>
<!-- 008 021 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043008022" id="008022" >22</span>
 “Is he going to kill himself,” the people exclaimed, “that he says –  <span class="woc"> ‘You cannot go where I am going’?” </span><span class="verse" rel="v043008023" id="008023" >23</span>
<span class="woc"> “You,” </span>  added Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “are from below, I am from above; you are of this present world, I am not; </span><span class="verse" rel="v043008024" id="008024" >24</span>
<span class="woc"> and so I told you that you would die in your sins, for, unless you believe that I am what I am, you will die in your sins.” </span>
<!-- 008 024 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043008025" id="008025" >25</span>
 “Who are you?” they asked.  <span class="woc"> “Why ask exactly what I have been telling you?” </span>  said Jesus. <span class="verse" rel="v043008026" id="008026" >26</span>
<span class="woc"> “I have still much that concerns you to speak of and to pass judgment on; yet he who sent me may be trusted, and I speak to the world only of the things which I have heard from him.” </span><span class="verse" rel="v043008027" id="008027" >27</span>
 They did not understand that he meant the Father. <span class="verse" rel="v043008028" id="008028" >28</span>
 So Jesus added,  <span class="woc"> “When you have lifted up the Son of Man, then you will understand that I am what I am, and that I do nothing of myself, but that I say just what the Father has taught me. </span><span class="verse" rel="v043008029" id="008029" >29</span>
<span class="woc"> Moreover, he who sent me is with me; he has not left me alone; for I always do what pleases him.” </span><span class="verse" rel="v043008030" id="008030" >30</span>
 While he was speaking in this way, many came to believe in him. <span class="verse" rel="v043008031" id="008031" >31</span>
 So Jesus went on to say to those who had believed him,  <span class="woc"> “If you remain constant to my message, you are truly my disciples; </span><span class="verse" rel="v043008032" id="008032" >32</span>
<span class="woc"> and you will find out the truth, and the truth will set you free.” </span>
<!-- 008 032 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043008033" id="008033" >33</span>
 “We are descendants of Abraham,” was their answer, “and have never yet been in slavery to anyone. What do you mean by saying  <span class="woc"> ‘you will be set free’?” </span><span class="verse" rel="v043008034" id="008034" >34</span>
<span class="woc"> “In truth I tell you,” </span>  replied Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “everyone who sins is a slave to sin. </span><span class="verse" rel="v043008035" id="008035" >35</span>
<span class="woc"> And a slave does not remain in the home always; but a son remains always. </span><span class="verse" rel="v043008036" id="008036" >36</span>
<span class="woc"> If, then, the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed! </span><span class="verse" rel="v043008037" id="008037" >37</span>
<span class="woc"> I know that you are descendants of Abraham; yet you are seeking to put me to death, because my message finds no place in your hearts. </span><span class="verse" rel="v043008038" id="008038" >38</span>
<span class="woc"> I tell you what I have myself seen in the presence of my Father; and you, in the same way, do what you have learned from your father.” </span>
<!-- 008 038 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043008039" id="008039" >39</span>
 “Our father is Abraham,” was their answer.  <span class="woc"> “If you are Abraham’s children,” </span>  replied Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “do what Abraham did. </span><span class="verse" rel="v043008040" id="008040" >40</span>
<span class="woc"> But, as it is, you are seeking to put me to death – a man who has told you the truth as he heard it from God. Abraham did not act in that way. </span><span class="verse" rel="v043008041" id="008041" >41</span>
<span class="woc"> You are doing what your own father does.” </span>
<!-- 008 041 -->


<p>  “We are not bastards,” they said, “we have one Father – God himself.” 
<!-- 008 041 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043008042" id="008042" >42</span>
<span class="woc"> “If God were your Father,” </span>  Jesus replied,  <span class="woc"> “you would have loved me, for I came out from God, and now am here; and I have not come of myself, but he sent me as his messenger. </span><span class="verse" rel="v043008043" id="008043" >43</span>
<span class="woc"> How is it that you do not understand what I say? It is because you cannot bear to listen to my message. </span><span class="verse" rel="v043008044" id="008044" >44</span>
<span class="woc"> As for you, you are children of your father the devil, and you are determined to do what your father loves to do. He was a murderer from the first, and did not stand by the truth, because there is no truth in him. Whenever he lies, he does what is natural to him; because he is a liar, and the father of lying. </span><span class="verse" rel="v043008045" id="008045" >45</span>
<span class="woc"> But, as for me, it is because I speak the truth to you that you do not believe me. </span><span class="verse" rel="v043008046" id="008046" >46</span>
<span class="woc"> Which of you can convict me of sin? Why then don’t you believe me, if I am speaking truth? </span><span class="verse" rel="v043008047" id="008047" >47</span>
<span class="woc"> The person who comes from God listens to God’s teaching; the reason why you do not listen is because you do not come from God.” </span>
<!-- 008 047 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043008048" id="008048" >48</span>
 “Aren’t we right, after all,” replied the people, “in saying that you are a Samaritan, and are possessed by a demon?” 
<!-- 008 048 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043008049" id="008049" >49</span>
<span class="woc"> “I am not possessed by a demon,” </span>  Jesus answered,  <span class="woc"> “but I am honoring my Father; and yet you dishonor me. </span><span class="verse" rel="v043008050" id="008050" >50</span>
<span class="woc"> Not that I am seeking honor for myself; there is one who is seeking my honor, and he decides. </span><span class="verse" rel="v043008051" id="008051" >51</span>
<span class="woc"> In truth I tell you, if anyone lays my message to heart, he will never really die.” </span>
<!-- 008 051 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043008052" id="008052" >52</span>
 “Now we are sure that you are possessed by a demon,” the people replied. “Abraham died, and so did the prophets; and yet you say  <span class="woc"> ‘If anyone lays my message to heart, they will never know death.’ </span><span class="verse" rel="v043008053" id="008053" >53</span>
 Are you greater than our ancestor Abraham, who died? And the prophets died too. Whom do you make yourself out to be?” 
<!-- 008 053 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043008054" id="008054" >54</span>
<span class="woc"> “If I do honor to myself,” </span>  answered Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “such honor counts for nothing. It is my Father who does me honor – and you say that he is your God; </span><span class="verse" rel="v043008055" id="008055" >55</span>
<span class="woc"> and yet you have not learned to know him; but I know him; and, if I were to say that I do not know him, I should be a liar like you; but I do know him, and I lay his message to heart. </span><span class="verse" rel="v043008056" id="008056" >56</span>
<span class="woc"> Your ancestor Abraham rejoiced that he would see my day; and he did see it, and was glad.” </span>
<!-- 008 056 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043008057" id="008057" >57</span>
 “You are not fifty years old yet,” the people exclaimed, “and have you seen Abraham?” 
<!-- 008 057 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043008058" id="008058" >58</span>
<span class="woc"> “In truth I tell you,” </span>  replied Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “before Abraham existed I was.” </span><span class="verse" rel="v043008059" id="008059" >59</span>
 At this they took up stones to throw at him; but Jesus hid himself, and left the Temple Courts. <p>
<!-- 009 059 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="009001">9</span> As Jesus passed by, he saw a man who had been blind from his birth. <span class="verse" rel="v043009002" id="009002" >2</span>
 “Rabbi,” asked his disciples, “who was it that sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?” 
<!-- 009 002 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043009003" id="009003" >3</span>
<span class="woc"> “Neither the man nor the parents,” </span>  replied Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “but he was born blind so that the work of God should be made plain in him. </span><span class="verse" rel="v043009004" id="009004" >4</span>
<span class="woc"> We must do the work of him who sent me, while it is day; night is coming, when no one can work. </span><span class="verse" rel="v043009005" id="009005" >5</span>
<span class="woc"> As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.” </span><span class="verse" rel="v043009006" id="009006" >6</span>
 Saying this, Jesus spat on the ground, made some paste with the saliva, and put it on the man’s eyes. <span class="verse" rel="v043009007" id="009007" >7</span>
<span class="woc"> “Go,” </span>  he said,  <span class="woc"> “and wash your eyes in the Bath of Siloam” </span>  (a word which means ‘messenger’). So the man went and washed his eyes, and returned able to see. <span class="verse" rel="v043009008" id="009008" >8</span>
 His neighbors, and those who had formerly known him by sight as a beggar, exclaimed, “Is not this the man who used to sit and beg?” 
<!-- 009 008 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043009009" id="009009" >9</span>
 “Yes,” some said, “it is”; while others said, “No, but he is like him.” The man himself said, “I am he.” 
<!-- 009 009 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043009010" id="009010" >10</span>
 “How did you get your sight, then?” they asked. <span class="verse" rel="v043009011" id="009011" >11</span>
 “The man whom they call Jesus,” he answered, “made a paste, and anointed my eyes, and said to me  <span class="woc"> ‘Go to Siloam and wash your eyes.’ </span>  So I went and washed my eyes, and gained my sight.” 
<!-- 009 011 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043009012" id="009012" >12</span>
 “Where is he?” they asked. “I do not know,” he answered. <span class="verse" rel="v043009013" id="009013" >13</span>
 They took the man, who had been blind, to the Pharisees. <span class="verse" rel="v043009014" id="009014" >14</span>
 Now it was a Sabbath when Jesus made the paste and gave him his sight. <span class="verse" rel="v043009015" id="009015" >15</span>
 So the Pharisees also questioned the man as to how he had gained his sight. “He put a paste on my eyes,” he answered, “and I washed them, and I can see.” 
<!-- 009 015 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043009016" id="009016" >16</span>
 “The man cannot be from God,” said some of the Pharisees, “for he does not keep the Sabbath.” 
<!-- 009 016 -->


<p>  “How is it possible,” retorted others, “for a bad man to give signs like this?” <span class="verse" rel="v043009017" id="009017" >17</span>
 So there was a difference of opinion among them, and they again questioned the man. “What do you yourself say about him, for it is to you that he has given sight?” <span class="verse" rel="v043009018" id="009018" >18</span>
 The religious authorities, however, refused to believe that he had been blind and had gained his sight, until they had called his parents and questioned them. <span class="verse" rel="v043009019" id="009019" >19</span>
 “Is this your son,” they asked, “who you say was born blind? If so, how is it that he can see now?” 
<!-- 009 019 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043009020" id="009020" >20</span>
 “We know that this is our son,” answered the parents, “and that he was born blind; <span class="verse" rel="v043009021" id="009021" >21</span>
 but how it is that he can see now we do not know; nor do we know who it was that gave him his sight. Ask him – he is old enough – he will tell you about himself.” <span class="verse" rel="v043009022" id="009022" >22</span>
 His parents spoke in this way because they were afraid of the authorities; for the authorities had already agreed that, if anyone should acknowledge Jesus as the Christ, he should be expelled from their synagogues. <span class="verse" rel="v043009023" id="009023" >23</span>
 This was why his parents said ‘He is old enough; ask him.’ <span class="verse" rel="v043009024" id="009024" >24</span>
 So the authorities again called the man who had been blind, and said to him, “Give God the praise; we know that this is a bad man.” 
<!-- 009 024 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043009025" id="009025" >25</span>
 “I know nothing about his being a bad man,” he replied. “One thing I do know, that although I was blind, now I can see.” 
<!-- 009 025 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043009026" id="009026" >26</span>
 “What did he do to you?” they asked. “How did he give you your sight?” 
<!-- 009 026 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043009027" id="009027" >27</span>
 “I told you just now,” he answered, “and you did not listen. Why do you want to hear it again? Surely you also do not want to become his disciples?” 
<!-- 009 027 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043009028" id="009028" >28</span>
 “You are his disciple,” they retorted scornfully. “But we are disciples of Moses. <span class="verse" rel="v043009029" id="009029" >29</span>
 We know that God spoke to Moses; but, as for this man, we do not know where he comes from.” 
<!-- 009 029 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043009030" id="009030" >30</span>
 “Well,” the man replied, “this is very strange; you do not know where he comes from, and yet he has given me my sight! <span class="verse" rel="v043009031" id="009031" >31</span>
 We know that God never listens to bad people, but, when a person is god-fearing and does God’s will, God listens to them. <span class="verse" rel="v043009032" id="009032" >32</span>
 Since the world began, such a thing was never heard of as anyone’s giving sight to a person born blind. <span class="verse" rel="v043009033" id="009033" >33</span>
 If this man had not been from God, he could not have done anything at all.” 
<!-- 009 033 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043009034" id="009034" >34</span>
 “You,” they retorted, “were born totally depraved; and are you trying to teach us?” So they expelled him. <span class="verse" rel="v043009035" id="009035" >35</span>
 Jesus heard of their having put him out; and, when he had found the man, he asked,  <span class="woc"> “Do you believe in the Son of Man?” </span>
<!-- 009 035 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043009036" id="009036" >36</span>
 “Tell me who he is, Sir,” he replied, “so that I may believe in him.” 
<!-- 009 036 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043009037" id="009037" >37</span>
<span class="woc"> “Not only have you seen him,” </span>  said Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “but it is he who is now speaking to you.” </span>
<!-- 009 037 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043009038" id="009038" >38</span>
 “Then, Sir, I do believe,” said the man, bowing to the ground before him; <span class="verse" rel="v043009039" id="009039" >39</span>
 and Jesus added,  <span class="woc"> “It was to put people to the test that I came into this world, in order that those that cannot see should see, and that those that can see should become blind.” </span><span class="verse" rel="v043009040" id="009040" >40</span>
 Hearing this, some of the Pharisees who were with him said, “Then are we blind too?” 
<!-- 009 040 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043009041" id="009041" >41</span>
<span class="woc"> “If you had been blind,” </span>  replied Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “you would have had no sin to answer for; but, as it is, you say ‘We can see,’ and so your sin remains. </span><span class="chapter" id="010001">10</span><span class="woc"> In truth I tell you, whoever does not go into the sheepfold through the door, but climbs up at some other place, that person is a thief and a robber; </span><span class="verse" rel="v043010002" id="010002" >2</span>
<span class="woc"> but the person who goes in through the door is shepherd to the sheep. </span><span class="verse" rel="v043010003" id="010003" >3</span>
<span class="woc"> For him the watchman opens the door; and the sheep listen to his voice; and he calls his own sheep by name, and leads them out. </span><span class="verse" rel="v043010004" id="010004" >4</span>
<span class="woc"> When he has brought them all out, he walks in front of them, and his sheep follow him, because they know his voice. </span><span class="verse" rel="v043010005" id="010005" >5</span>
<span class="woc"> They will not follow a stranger, but will run away from him; because they do not know a stranger’s voice.” </span><span class="verse" rel="v043010006" id="010006" >6</span>
 This was the allegory that Jesus told them, but they did not understand of what he was speaking. <span class="verse" rel="v043010007" id="010007" >7</span>
 So he continued,  <span class="woc"> “In truth I tell you, I am the door for the sheep. </span><span class="verse" rel="v043010008" id="010008" >8</span>
<span class="woc"> All who came before me were thieves and robbers; but the sheep did not listen to them. </span><span class="verse" rel="v043010009" id="010009" >9</span>
<span class="woc"> I am the door; he who goes in through me will be safe, and he will go in and out and find pasture. </span><span class="verse" rel="v043010010" id="010010" >10</span>
<span class="woc"> The thief comes only to steal, to kill, and to destroy; I have come so that they may have life, and may have it in greater fullness. </span><span class="verse" rel="v043010011" id="010011" >11</span>
<span class="woc"> I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for his sheep. </span><span class="verse" rel="v043010012" id="010012" >12</span>
<span class="woc"> The hired man who is not a shepherd, and who does not own the sheep, when he sees a wolf coming, leaves them and runs away; then the wolf seizes them, and scatters the flock. </span><span class="verse" rel="v043010013" id="010013" >13</span>
<span class="woc"> He does this because he is only a hired man and does not care about the sheep. </span><span class="verse" rel="v043010014" id="010014" >14</span>
<span class="woc"> I am the good shepherd; and I know my sheep, and my sheep know me – </span><span class="verse" rel="v043010015" id="010015" >15</span>
<span class="woc"> Just as the Father knows me and I know the Father – and I lay down my life for the sheep. </span><span class="verse" rel="v043010016" id="010016" >16</span>
<span class="woc"> I have other sheep besides, which do not belong to this fold; I must lead them also, and they will listen to my voice; and they will become one flock under one shepherd. </span><span class="verse" rel="v043010017" id="010017" >17</span>
<span class="woc"> This is why the Father loves me, because I lay down my life – to receive it again. </span><span class="verse" rel="v043010018" id="010018" >18</span>
<span class="woc"> No one took it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have authority to lay it down, and I have authority to receive it again. This is the command which I received from my Father.” </span>
<!-- 010 018 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043010019" id="010019" >19</span>
 In consequence of these words a difference of opinion again arose among the people. <span class="verse" rel="v043010020" id="010020" >20</span>
 Many of them said, “He is possessed by a demon and is mad; why do you listen to him?” <span class="verse" rel="v043010021" id="010021" >21</span>
 Others said, “This is not the teaching of one who is possessed by a demon. Can a demon give sight to the blind?” <p>
<!-- 010 021 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043010022" id="010022" >22</span>
 Soon after this the Festival of the Rededication was held at Jerusalem. <span class="verse" rel="v043010023" id="010023" >23</span>
 It was winter; and Jesus was walking in the Temple Courts, in the Colonnade of Solomon, <span class="verse" rel="v043010024" id="010024" >24</span>
 when the people gathered around him, and said, “How long are you going to keep us in suspense? If you are the Christ, tell us so frankly.” 
<!-- 010 024 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043010025" id="010025" >25</span>
<span class="woc"> “I have told you so,” </span>  replied Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “and you do not believe me. The work that I am doing in my Father’s name bears testimony to me. </span><span class="verse" rel="v043010026" id="010026" >26</span>
<span class="woc"> But you do not believe me, because you are not of my flock. </span><span class="verse" rel="v043010027" id="010027" >27</span>
<span class="woc"> My sheep listen to my voice; I know them, and they follow me; </span><span class="verse" rel="v043010028" id="010028" >28</span>
<span class="woc"> and I give them eternal life, and they will not be lost; nor will anyone snatch them out of my hands. </span><span class="verse" rel="v043010029" id="010029" >29</span>
<span class="woc"> What my Father has entrusted to me is more than all else; and no one can snatch anything out of the Father’s hands. </span><span class="verse" rel="v043010030" id="010030" >30</span>
<span class="woc"> The Father and I are one.” </span>
<!-- 010 030 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043010031" id="010031" >31</span>
 Some of the people again brought stones to throw at him; <span class="verse" rel="v043010032" id="010032" >32</span>
 and seeing this, Jesus said,  <span class="woc"> “I have done before your eyes many good actions, inspired by the Father; for which of them would you stone me?” </span>
<!-- 010 032 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043010033" id="010033" >33</span>
 “It is not for any good action that we would stone you,” they answered, “but for blasphemy; and because you, who are only a man, make yourself out to be God.” 
<!-- 010 033 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043010034" id="010034" >34</span>
<span class="woc"> “Are there not,” </span>  replied Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “these words in your Law – ‘I said, You are gods’? </span><span class="verse" rel="v043010035" id="010035" >35</span>
<span class="woc"> If those to whom God’s word were addressed were said to be ‘gods’ – and scripture cannot be set aside – </span><span class="verse" rel="v043010036" id="010036" >36</span>
<span class="woc"> do you say of one whom the Father has consecrated and sent as his messenger to the world ‘You are blaspheming,’ because I said ‘I am God’s Son’? </span><span class="verse" rel="v043010037" id="010037" >37</span>
<span class="woc"> If I am not doing the work that my Father is doing, do not believe me; </span><span class="verse" rel="v043010038" id="010038" >38</span>
<span class="woc"> if I am doing it, even though you do not believe me, believe what that work shows; so that you may understand, and understand more and more clearly, that the Father is in union with me, and I with the Father.” </span><span class="verse" rel="v043010039" id="010039" >39</span>
 The authorities again sought to arrest him; but he escaped their hands. <p>
<!-- 010 039 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043010040" id="010040" >40</span>
 Then Jesus again crossed the Jordan to the place where John used to baptize at first, and stayed there some time, during which many people came to see him. <span class="verse" rel="v043010041" id="010041" >41</span>
 “John gave no sign of his mission,” they said. “But everything that he said about this man was true.” <span class="verse" rel="v043010042" id="010042" >42</span>
 And many learned to believe in Jesus there. <p>
<!-- 011 042 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="011001">11</span> Now a man named Lazarus, of Bethany, was lying ill; he belonged to the same village as Mary and her sister Martha. <span class="verse" rel="v043011002" id="011002" >2</span>
 This Mary, whose brother Lazarus was ill, was the Mary who anointed the Master with perfume, and wiped his feet with her hair. <span class="verse" rel="v043011003" id="011003" >3</span>
 The sisters, therefore, sent this message to Jesus – ‘Master, your friend is ill’; <span class="verse" rel="v043011004" id="011004" >4</span>
 and, when Jesus heard it, he said,  <span class="woc"> “This illness is not to end in death, but is to redound to the honor of God, in order that the Son of God may be honored through it.” </span><span class="verse" rel="v043011005" id="011005" >5</span>
 Jesus loved Martha and her sister, and Lazarus. <span class="verse" rel="v043011006" id="011006" >6</span>
 Yet, when he heard of the illness of Lazarus, he still stayed two days in the place where he was. <span class="verse" rel="v043011007" id="011007" >7</span>
 Then, after that, he said to his disciples,  <span class="woc"> “Let us go to Judea again.” </span>
<!-- 011 007 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043011008" id="011008" >8</span>
 “Rabbi,” they replied, “the authorities there were but just now seeking to stone you; and are you going there again?” 
<!-- 011 008 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043011009" id="011009" >9</span>
<span class="woc"> “Are not there twelve hours in the day?” </span>  answered Jesus.  <span class="woc"> “If someone walks about in the daytime, they don’t stumble, because they can see the light of the sun; </span><span class="verse" rel="v043011010" id="011010" >10</span>
<span class="woc"> but, if they walk about at night, they stumble, because they have not the light.” </span><span class="verse" rel="v043011011" id="011011" >11</span>
 And, when he had said this, he added,  <span class="woc"> “Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep; but I am going so that I may wake him.” </span>
<!-- 011 011 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043011012" id="011012" >12</span>
 “If he has fallen asleep, Master, he will get well,” said the disciples. <span class="verse" rel="v043011013" id="011013" >13</span>
 But Jesus meant that he was dead; they, however, supposed that he was speaking of natural sleep. <span class="verse" rel="v043011014" id="011014" >14</span>
 Then he said to them plainly,  <span class="woc"> “Lazarus is dead; </span><span class="verse" rel="v043011015" id="011015" >15</span>
<span class="woc"> and I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, so that you may learn to believe in me. But let us go to him.” </span><span class="verse" rel="v043011016" id="011016" >16</span>
 At this, Thomas, who was called ‘The Twin,’ said to his fellow disciples, “Let us go too, so that we may die with him.” <span class="verse" rel="v043011017" id="011017" >17</span>
 When Jesus reached the place, he found that Lazarus had been four days in the tomb already. <span class="verse" rel="v043011018" id="011018" >18</span>
 Bethany being only about two miles from Jerusalem, <span class="verse" rel="v043011019" id="011019" >19</span>
 a number of the people had come there to comfort Martha and Mary because of their brother’s death. <span class="verse" rel="v043011020" id="011020" >20</span>
 When Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went to meet him; but Mary sat quietly at home. <span class="verse" rel="v043011021" id="011021" >21</span>
 “Master,” Martha said to Jesus, “if you had been here, my brother would not have died. <span class="verse" rel="v043011022" id="011022" >22</span>
 Even now, I know that God will grant you whatever you ask him.” 
<!-- 011 022 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043011023" id="011023" >23</span>
<span class="woc"> “Your brother will rise to life,” </span>  said Jesus. <span class="verse" rel="v043011024" id="011024" >24</span>
 “I know that he will,” replied Martha, “in the resurrection at the Last day.” 
<!-- 011 024 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043011025" id="011025" >25</span>
<span class="woc"> “I am the resurrection and the life,” </span>  said Jesus.  <span class="woc"> “He who believes in me will live, though he die; </span><span class="verse" rel="v043011026" id="011026" >26</span>
<span class="woc"> and he who lives and believes in me will never die. Do you believe this?” </span>
<!-- 011 026 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043011027" id="011027" >27</span>
 “Yes Master,” she answered. “I have learned to believe that you are the Christ, the Son of God, who was to come into the world.” <span class="verse" rel="v043011028" id="011028" >28</span>
 After saying this, Martha went and called her sister Mary, and whispered, “The teacher is here, and is asking for you.” <span class="verse" rel="v043011029" id="011029" >29</span>
 As soon as Mary heard that, she got up quickly, and went to meet him. <span class="verse" rel="v043011030" id="011030" >30</span>
 Jesus had not then come into the village, but was still at the place where Martha had met him. <span class="verse" rel="v043011031" id="011031" >31</span>
 So the people, who were in the house with Mary, comforting her, when they saw her get up quickly and go out, followed her, thinking that she was going to the tomb to weep there. <span class="verse" rel="v043011032" id="011032" >32</span>
 When Mary came where Jesus was and saw him, she threw herself at his feet. “Master,” she exclaimed, “if you had been here, my brother would not have died!” <span class="verse" rel="v043011033" id="011033" >33</span>
 When Jesus saw her weeping, and the people who had come with her weeping also, he groaned deeply, and was greatly distressed. <span class="verse" rel="v043011034" id="011034" >34</span>
<span class="woc"> “Where have you buried him?” </span>  he asked. “Come and see, Master,” they answered. <span class="verse" rel="v043011035" id="011035" >35</span>
 Jesus burst into tears. <span class="verse" rel="v043011036" id="011036" >36</span>
 “How he must have loved him!” the people exclaimed; <span class="verse" rel="v043011037" id="011037" >37</span>
 but some of them said, “Could not this man, who gave sight to the blind man, have also prevented Lazarus from dying?” <span class="verse" rel="v043011038" id="011038" >38</span>
 Again groaning inwardly, Jesus came to the tomb. It was a cave, and a stone lay against the mouth of it. <span class="verse" rel="v043011039" id="011039" >39</span>
<span class="woc"> “Move the stone away,” </span>  said Jesus. “Master,” said Martha, the sister of the dead man, “by this time the smell must be offensive, for this is the fourth day since his death.” 
<!-- 011 039 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043011040" id="011040" >40</span>
<span class="woc"> “Didn’t I tell you,” </span>  replied Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “that, if you would believe in me, you should see the glory of God?” </span><span class="verse" rel="v043011041" id="011041" >41</span>
 So they moved the stone away; and Jesus, with uplifted eyes, said,  <span class="woc"> “Father, I thank you that you have heard my prayer; </span><span class="verse" rel="v043011042" id="011042" >42</span>
<span class="woc"> I know that you always hear me; but I say this for the sake of the people standing near, so that they may believe that you has sent me as your messenger.” </span>
<!-- 011 042 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043011043" id="011043" >43</span>
 Then, after saying this, Jesus called in a loud voice,  <span class="woc"> “Lazarus! Come out!” </span><span class="verse" rel="v043011044" id="011044" >44</span>
 The dead man came out, wrapped hand and foot in a winding-sheet; his face, too, had been wrapped in a cloth.  <span class="woc"> “Set him free,” </span>  said Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “and let him go.” </span><p>
<!-- 011 044 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043011045" id="011045" >45</span>
 In consequence of this, many of the people, who had come to visit Mary and had seen what Jesus did, put their faith in him. <span class="verse" rel="v043011046" id="011046" >46</span>
 Some of them, however, went to the Pharisees, and told them what he had done. <span class="verse" rel="v043011047" id="011047" >47</span>
 The chief priests and the Pharisees called a meeting of the High Council, and said, “What are we to do, now that this man is giving so many signs? <span class="verse" rel="v043011048" id="011048" >48</span>
 If we allow him to continue as we are doing, everyone will believe in him; and the Romans will come and will take from us both our Temple and our nation.” <span class="verse" rel="v043011049" id="011049" >49</span>
 One of them, however, Caiaphas, who was high priest that year, said to them, <span class="verse" rel="v043011050" id="011050" >50</span>
 “You are utterly mistaken. You do not consider that it is better for you that one person should die for the people, rather than the whole nation should be destroyed.” <span class="verse" rel="v043011051" id="011051" >51</span>
 Now he did not say this of his own accord; but, as high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus was to die for the nation – <span class="verse" rel="v043011052" id="011052" >52</span>
 And not for the nation only, but also that he might unite in one body the children of God now scattered far and wide. <span class="verse" rel="v043011053" id="011053" >53</span>
 So from that day they plotted to put Jesus to death. <p>
<!-- 011 053 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043011054" id="011054" >54</span>
 In consequence of this, Jesus did not go about publicly among the people any more, but left and went into the country bordering on the wilderness, to a town called Ephraim, where he stayed with his disciples. <span class="verse" rel="v043011055" id="011055" >55</span>
 But the Jewish Festival of the Passover was near; and many people had gone up from the country to Jerusalem, for their purification, before the Festival began. <span class="verse" rel="v043011056" id="011056" >56</span>
 So they looked for Jesus there, and said to one another, as they stood in the Temple Courts, “What do you think? Do you think he will come to the Festival?” <span class="verse" rel="v043011057" id="011057" >57</span>
 The chief priests and the Pharisees had already issued orders that, if anyone learned where Jesus was, he should give information, so that they might arrest him. 
<h6>The Last Days</h6>
<!-- 012 057 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="012001">12</span> Six days before the Passover Jesus came to Bethany, where Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead, was living. <span class="verse" rel="v043012002" id="012002" >2</span>
 There a supper was given in his honor at which Martha waited, while Lazarus was one of those present at the table. <span class="verse" rel="v043012003" id="012003" >3</span>
 So Mary took a pound of choice spikenard perfume of great value, and anointed the feet of Jesus with it, and then wiped them with her hair. The whole house was filled with the scent of the perfume. <span class="verse" rel="v043012004" id="012004" >4</span>
 One of the disciples, Judas Iscariot, who was about to betray Jesus, asked, <span class="verse" rel="v043012005" id="012005" >5</span>
 “Why was not this perfume sold for a year’s wages, and the money given to poor people?” <span class="verse" rel="v043012006" id="012006" >6</span>
 He said this, not because he cared for the poor, but because he was a thief, and, being in charge of the purse, used to take what was put in it. <span class="verse" rel="v043012007" id="012007" >7</span>
<span class="woc"> “Leave her alone,” </span>  said Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “so that she may keep it until the day when my body is being prepared for burial. </span><span class="verse" rel="v043012008" id="012008" >8</span>
<span class="woc"> The poor you always have with you, but you will not always have me.” </span>
<!-- 012 008 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043012009" id="012009" >9</span>
 Now great numbers of people found out that Jesus was at Bethany; and they came there, not only because of him, but also to see Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead. <span class="verse" rel="v043012010" id="012010" >10</span>
 The chief priests, however, plotted to put Lazarus, as well as Jesus, to death, <span class="verse" rel="v043012011" id="012011" >11</span>
 because it was owing to him that many of the people had left them, and were becoming believers in Jesus. <span class="verse" rel="v043012012" id="012012" >12</span>
 On the following day great numbers of people who had come to the Festival, hearing that Jesus was on his way to Jerusalem, took palm branches, <span class="verse" rel="v043012013" id="012013" >13</span>
 and went out to meet him, shouting as they went, “God save him! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord – the king of Israel!” <span class="verse" rel="v043012014" id="012014" >14</span>
 Having found a young donkey, Jesus seated himself on it, in accordance with the passage of scripture – <span class="verse" rel="v043012015" id="012015" >15</span>
 ‘Fear not, people of Zion. Your king is coming to you, sitting on the foal of a donkey.’ <span class="verse" rel="v043012016" id="012016" >16</span>
 His disciples did not understand all this at first; but, when Jesus had been exalted, then they remembered that these things had been said of him in scripture, and that they had done these things for him. <span class="verse" rel="v043012017" id="012017" >17</span>
 Meanwhile the people who were with him, when he called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him from the dead, were telling what they had seen. <span class="verse" rel="v043012018" id="012018" >18</span>
 This, indeed, was why the crowd met him – because people had heard that he had given this sign of his mission. <span class="verse" rel="v043012019" id="012019" >19</span>
 So the Pharisees said to one another, “You see that you are gaining nothing! Why, all the world has run after him!” <p>
<!-- 012 019 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043012020" id="012020" >20</span>
 Among those who were going up to worship at the Festival were some Greeks, <span class="verse" rel="v043012021" id="012021" >21</span>
 who went to Philip of Bethsaida in Galilee, and said, “Sir, we wish to see Jesus.” <span class="verse" rel="v043012022" id="012022" >22</span>
 Philip went and told Andrew, and then together they went and told Jesus. <span class="verse" rel="v043012023" id="012023" >23</span>
 This was his reply –  <span class="woc"> “The time has come for the Son of Man to be exalted. </span><span class="verse" rel="v043012024" id="012024" >24</span>
<span class="woc"> In truth I tell you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it remains solitary; but, if it dies, it becomes fruitful. </span><span class="verse" rel="v043012025" id="012025" >25</span>
<span class="woc"> A person who loves their life loses it; while someone who hates their life in the present world will preserve it for eternal life. </span><span class="verse" rel="v043012026" id="012026" >26</span>
<span class="woc"> If someone is ready to serve me, let them follow me; and where I am, there my servant will be also. If a person is ready to serve me, my Father will honor them. </span><span class="verse" rel="v043012027" id="012027" >27</span>
<span class="woc"> Now I am distressed at heart and what can I say? Father, bring me safe through this hour – yet it was for this reason that I came to this hour – </span><span class="verse" rel="v043012028" id="012028" >28</span>
<span class="woc"> Father, honor your own name.” </span>  At this there came a voice from heaven, which said, “I have already honored it, and I will honor it again.” <span class="verse" rel="v043012029" id="012029" >29</span>
 The crowd of bystanders, who heard the sound, said that it was thundering. Others said, “An angel has been speaking to him.” 
<!-- 012 029 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043012030" id="012030" >30</span>
<span class="woc"> “It was not for my sake that the voice came,” </span>  said Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “but for yours. </span><span class="verse" rel="v043012031" id="012031" >31</span>
<span class="woc"> Now this world is on its trial. Now the Spirit that is ruling this world will be driven out; </span><span class="verse" rel="v043012032" id="012032" >32</span>
<span class="woc"> and I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all people to myself.” </span><span class="verse" rel="v043012033" id="012033" >33</span>
 By these words he indicated what death he was destined to die. <span class="verse" rel="v043012034" id="012034" >34</span>
 “We,” replied the people, “have learned from the Law that the Christ is to remain for ever; how is it, then, that you say that the Son of Man must be  <span class="woc"> ‘lifted up’ </span>  Who is this ‘Son of Man’?” 
<!-- 012 034 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043012035" id="012035" >35</span>
<span class="woc"> “Only a little while longer,” </span>  answered Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “will you have the light among you. Travel on while you have the light, so that darkness may not overtake you; he who travels in the darkness does not know where he is going. </span><span class="verse" rel="v043012036" id="012036" >36</span>
<span class="woc"> While you still have the light, believe in the light, so that you may be children of light.” </span>  After he had said this, Jesus went away, and hid himself from them. <span class="verse" rel="v043012037" id="012037" >37</span>
 But, though Jesus had given so many signs of his mission before their eyes, they still did not believe in him, <span class="verse" rel="v043012038" id="012038" >38</span>
 in fulfillment of the words of the prophet Isaiah, where he says – ‘Lord, who has believed our teaching? And to whom has the might of the Lord been revealed?’ <span class="verse" rel="v043012039" id="012039" >39</span>
 The reason why they were unable to believe is given by Isaiah elsewhere, in these words – <span class="verse" rel="v043012040" id="012040" >40</span>
 ‘He has blinded their eyes, and blunted their mind, so that they should not see with their eyes, and perceive with their mind, and turn – And I should heal them.’ <span class="verse" rel="v043012041" id="012041" >41</span>
 Isaiah said this, because he saw Christ’s glory; and it was of him that he spoke. <span class="verse" rel="v043012042" id="012042" >42</span>
 Yet for all this, even among the leading men there were many who came to believe in Jesus; but, because of the Pharisees, they did not acknowledge it, because they were afraid that they should be expelled from their synagogues; <span class="verse" rel="v043012043" id="012043" >43</span>
 for they valued honor from people more than honor from God. <span class="verse" rel="v043012044" id="012044" >44</span>
 But Jesus had proclaimed,  <span class="woc"> “He who believes in me believes, not in me, but in him who sent me; </span><span class="verse" rel="v043012045" id="012045" >45</span>
<span class="woc"> and he who sees me sees him who sent me. </span><span class="verse" rel="v043012046" id="012046" >46</span>
<span class="woc"> I have come as a light into the world, so that no one who believes in me should remain in the darkness. </span><span class="verse" rel="v043012047" id="012047" >47</span>
<span class="woc"> When anyone hears my teaching and pays no heed to it, I am not his judge; for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world. </span><span class="verse" rel="v043012048" id="012048" >48</span>
<span class="woc"> He who rejects me, and disregards my teaching, has a judge already – the message which I have delivered will itself be his judge at the Last day. </span><span class="verse" rel="v043012049" id="012049" >49</span>
<span class="woc"> For I have not delivered it on my own authority; but the Father, who sent me, has himself given me his command as to what I should say, and what message I should deliver. </span><span class="verse" rel="v043012050" id="012050" >50</span>
<span class="woc"> And I know that eternal life lies in keeping his command. Therefore, whatever I say, I say only what the Father has taught me.” </span><p><span class="chapter" id="013001">13</span> Before the Passover Festival began, Jesus knew that the time had come for him to leave the world and go to the Father. He had loved those who were his own in the world, and he loved them to the last. <span class="verse" rel="v043013002" id="013002" >2</span>
 The devil had already put the thought of betraying Jesus into the mind of Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon; <span class="verse" rel="v043013003" id="013003" >3</span>
 and at supper, Jesus – although knowing that the Father had put everything into his hands, and that he had come from God, and was to return to God – <span class="verse" rel="v043013004" id="013004" >4</span>
 rose from his place, and, taking off his upper garments, tied a towel around his waist. <span class="verse" rel="v043013005" id="013005" >5</span>
 He then poured some water into the basin, and began to wash the disciples’ feet, and to wipe them with the towel which was tied around him. <span class="verse" rel="v043013006" id="013006" >6</span>
 When he came to Simon Peter, Peter said, “You, Master! Are you going to wash my feet?” 
<!-- 013 006 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043013007" id="013007" >7</span>
<span class="woc"> “You do not understand now what I am doing,” </span>  replied Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “but you will learn by and by.” </span>
<!-- 013 007 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043013008" id="013008" >8</span>
 “You will never wash my feet!” exclaimed Peter.  <span class="woc"> “Unless I wash you,” </span>  answered Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “you have nothing in common with me.” </span>
<!-- 013 008 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043013009" id="013009" >9</span>
 “Then, Master, not my feet only,” exclaimed Simon Peter, “but also my hands and my head.” 
<!-- 013 009 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043013010" id="013010" >10</span>
<span class="woc"> “He who has bathed,” </span>  replied Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “has no need to wash, unless it be his feet, but is altogether clean; and you,” </span>  he said to the disciples,  <span class="woc"> “are clean, yet not all of you.” </span><span class="verse" rel="v043013011" id="013011" >11</span>
 For he knew who was going to betray him, and that was why he said  <span class="woc"> ‘You are not all clean.’ </span><span class="verse" rel="v043013012" id="013012" >12</span>
 When he had washed their feet, and had put on his upper garments and taken his place, he spoke to them again.  <span class="woc"> “Do you understand what I have been doing to you?” </span>  he asked. <span class="verse" rel="v043013013" id="013013" >13</span>
<span class="woc"> “You yourselves call me ‘the teacher’ and ‘the Master’, and you are right, for I am both. </span><span class="verse" rel="v043013014" id="013014" >14</span>
<span class="woc"> If I, then – ‘the Master’ and ‘the teacher’ – have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another’s feet; </span><span class="verse" rel="v043013015" id="013015" >15</span>
<span class="woc"> for I have given you an example, so that you may do just as I have done to you. </span><span class="verse" rel="v043013016" id="013016" >16</span>
<span class="woc"> In truth I tell you, a servant is not greater than their master, neither is a messenger greater than the one who sends them. </span><span class="verse" rel="v043013017" id="013017" >17</span>
<span class="woc"> Now that you know these things, happy are you if you do them. </span><span class="verse" rel="v043013018" id="013018" >18</span>
<span class="woc"> I am not speaking about all of you. I know whom I have chosen; but this is in fulfillment of the words of scripture – ‘He that is eating my bread has lifted his heel against me.’ </span><span class="verse" rel="v043013019" id="013019" >19</span>
<span class="woc"> For the future I will tell you of things before they take place, so that, when they take place, you may believe that I am what I am. </span><span class="verse" rel="v043013020" id="013020" >20</span>
<span class="woc"> In truth I tell you, the one who receives anyone that I send receives me; and the person who receives me receives him who sent me.” </span><span class="verse" rel="v043013021" id="013021" >21</span>
 After saying this, Jesus was much troubled, and said solemnly,  <span class="woc"> “In truth I tell you that it is one of you who will betray me.” </span><span class="verse" rel="v043013022" id="013022" >22</span>
 The disciples looked at one another, wondering whom he meant. <span class="verse" rel="v043013023" id="013023" >23</span>
 Next to Jesus, in the place on his right hand, was one of his disciples, whom he loved. <span class="verse" rel="v043013024" id="013024" >24</span>
 So Simon Peter made signs to that disciple, and whispered, “Tell me who it is that he means.” <span class="verse" rel="v043013025" id="013025" >25</span>
 Being in this position, that disciple leant back on Jesus’ shoulder, and asked him, “Who is it, Master?” 
<!-- 013 025 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043013026" id="013026" >26</span>
<span class="woc"> “It is the one,” </span>  answered Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “to whom I will give a piece of bread after dipping it in the dish.” </span>  And, when Jesus had dipped the bread, he took it and gave it to Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot; <span class="verse" rel="v043013027" id="013027" >27</span>
 and it was then, after he had received it, that Satan took possession of him. So Jesus said to him,  <span class="woc"> “Do at once what you are going to do.” </span><span class="verse" rel="v043013028" id="013028" >28</span>
 But no one at the table understood why he said this to Judas. <span class="verse" rel="v043013029" id="013029" >29</span>
 Some thought that, as Judas kept the purse, Jesus meant that he was to buy some things needed for the Festival, or to give something to the poor. <span class="verse" rel="v043013030" id="013030" >30</span>
 After taking the piece of bread, Judas went out immediately; and it was night. <p>
<!-- 013 030 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043013031" id="013031" >31</span>
 When Judas had gone out, Jesus said,  <span class="woc"> “Now the Son of Man has been exalted, and God has been exalted through him; </span><span class="verse" rel="v043013032" id="013032" >32</span>
<span class="woc"> and God will exalt him with himself – yes, he will exalt him forthwith. </span><span class="verse" rel="v043013033" id="013033" >33</span>
<span class="woc"> My children, I am to be with you but a little while longer. You will look for me; and what I said to the people – ‘You cannot come where I am going’ – I now say to you. </span><span class="verse" rel="v043013034" id="013034" >34</span>
<span class="woc"> I give you a new commandment – love one another; love one another as I have loved you. </span><span class="verse" rel="v043013035" id="013035" >35</span>
<span class="woc"> It is by this that everyone will recognize you as my disciples – by your loving one another.” </span>
<!-- 013 035 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043013036" id="013036" >36</span>
 “Where are you going, Master?” asked Peter.  <span class="woc"> “I am going where you cannot now follow me,” </span>  answered Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “but you will follow me later.” </span>
<!-- 013 036 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043013037" id="013037" >37</span>
 “Why cannot I follow you now, Master?” asked Peter. “I will lay down my life for you.” 
<!-- 013 037 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043013038" id="013038" >38</span>
<span class="woc"> “Will you lay down your life for me?” </span>  replied Jesus.  <span class="woc"> “In truth I tell you, the cock will not crow until you have disowned me three times. </span><span class="chapter" id="014001">14</span><span class="woc"> Do not let your hearts be troubled. Believe in God; believe also in me. </span><span class="verse" rel="v043014002" id="014002" >2</span>
<span class="woc"> In my Father’s home there are many dwellings. If it had not been so, I should have told you, for I am going to prepare a place for you. </span><span class="verse" rel="v043014003" id="014003" >3</span>
<span class="woc"> And, since I go and prepare a place for you, I will return and take you to be with me, so that you may be where I am; </span><span class="verse" rel="v043014004" id="014004" >4</span>
<span class="woc"> and you know the way to the place where I am going.” </span>
<!-- 014 004 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043014005" id="014005" >5</span>
 “We do not know where you are going, Master,” said Thomas. “So how can we know the way?” <span class="verse" rel="v043014006" id="014006" >6</span>
 Jesus answered,  <span class="woc"> “I am the way, and the truth, and the life; no one ever comes to the Father except through me. </span><span class="verse" rel="v043014007" id="014007" >7</span>
<span class="woc"> If you had recognized me, you would have known my Father also; for the future you will recognize him, indeed you have already seen him.” </span>
<!-- 014 007 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043014008" id="014008" >8</span>
 “Master, show us the Father,” said Philip, “and we will be satisfied.” 
<!-- 014 008 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043014009" id="014009" >9</span>
<span class="woc"> “Have I been all this time among you,” </span>  said Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “and yet you, Philip, have not recognized me? The person who has seen me has seen the Father, how can you say, then, ‘Show us the Father’? </span><span class="verse" rel="v043014010" id="014010" >10</span>
<span class="woc"> Don’t you believe that I am in union with the Father, and the Father with me? In giving you my teaching I am not speaking on my own authority; but the Father himself, always in union with me, does his own work. </span><span class="verse" rel="v043014011" id="014011" >11</span>
<span class="woc"> Believe me,” he said to them all, “when I say that I am in union with the Father and the Father with me, or else believe me because of the work itself. </span><span class="verse" rel="v043014012" id="014012" >12</span>
<span class="woc"> In truth I tell you, the person who believes in me will themselves do the work that I am doing; and they will do greater work still, because I am going to the Father. </span><span class="verse" rel="v043014013" id="014013" >13</span>
<span class="woc"> Whatever you ask, in my name, I will do, so that the Father may be honored in the Son. </span><span class="verse" rel="v043014014" id="014014" >14</span>

<span class="woc"> You are already clean because of the message that I have given you. </span><span class="verse" rel="v043015004" id="015004" >4</span>

<span class="woc"> I am the vine, you are the branches. If you remains united to me, while I remain united to you – you bear fruit plentifully; for you can do nothing apart from me. </span><span class="verse" rel="v043015006" id="015006" >6</span>
<span class="woc"> If anyone does not remain united to me, they are thrown away, as a branch would be, and withers up. Such branches are collected and thrown into the fire, and are burnt. </span><span class="verse" rel="v043015007" id="015007" >7</span>
<span class="woc"> If you remain united to me, and my teaching remains in your hearts, ask whatever you wish, and it will be yours. </span><span class="verse" rel="v043015008" id="015008" >8</span>

<span class="woc"> I no longer call you ‘servants,’ because a servant does not know what their master is doing; but I have given you the name of ‘friends,’ because I made known to you everything that I learned from my Father. </span><span class="verse" rel="v043015016" id="015016" >16</span>
<span class="woc"> It wasn’t you who chose me, but I who chose you, and I appointed you to go and bear fruit – fruit that should remain, so that the Father might grant you whatever you ask in my name. </span><span class="verse" rel="v043015017" id="015017" >17</span>
<span class="woc"> I am giving you these commands that you may love one another. </span><span class="verse" rel="v043015018" id="015018" >18</span>
<span class="woc"> If the world hates you, you know that it has first hated me. </span><span class="verse" rel="v043015019" id="015019" >19</span>
<span class="woc"> If you belonged to the world, the world would love its own. Because you do not belong to the world, but I have chosen you out of the world – that is why the world hates you. </span><span class="verse" rel="v043015020" id="015020" >20</span>
<span class="woc"> Remember what I said to you – ‘A servant is not greater than their master.’ If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you; if they have laid my message to heart, they will lay yours to heart also. </span><span class="verse" rel="v043015021" id="015021" >21</span>
<span class="woc"> But they will do all this to you, because you believe in my name, for they do not know him who sent me. </span><span class="verse" rel="v043015022" id="015022" >22</span>
<span class="woc"> If I had not come and spoken to them, they would have had no sin to answer for; but as it is, they have no excuse for their sin. </span><span class="verse" rel="v043015023" id="015023" >23</span>
<span class="woc"> The person who hates me hates my Father also. </span><span class="verse" rel="v043015024" id="015024" >24</span>
<span class="woc"> If I had not done among them such work as no one else ever did, they would have had no sin to answer for; but, as it is, they have both seen and hated both me and my Father. </span><span class="verse" rel="v043015025" id="015025" >25</span>
<span class="woc"> And so is fulfilled what is said in their Law – ‘They hated me without cause.’ </span><span class="verse" rel="v043015026" id="015026" >26</span>
<span class="woc"> But, when the helper comes, whom I will send to you from the Father – the Spirit of truth, who comes from the Father – will bear testimony to me; </span><span class="verse" rel="v043015027" id="015027" >27</span>
<span class="woc"> yes, and you also are to bear testimony, because you have been with me from the first. </span><span class="chapter" id="016001">16</span> “I have spoken to you in this way so that you may not falter. <span class="verse" rel="v043016002" id="016002" >2</span>

<span class="woc"> They will do this, because they have not learned to know the Father, or even me. </span><span class="verse" rel="v043016004" id="016004" >4</span>
<span class="woc"> But I have spoken to you of these things so that, when the time for them comes, you may remember that I told you about them myself. </span><span class="verse" rel="v043016005" id="016005" >5</span>
<span class="woc"> I did not tell you all this at first, because I was with you. But now I am to return to him who sent me; and yet not one of you asks me – ‘Where are you going?’ </span><span class="verse" rel="v043016006" id="016006" >6</span>
<span class="woc"> Although your hearts are full of sorrow at all that I have been saying to you. </span><span class="verse" rel="v043016007" id="016007" >7</span>
<span class="woc"> Yet I am only telling you the truth; it is for your good that I should go away. For otherwise the helper will never come to you, but, if I leave you, I will send him to you. </span><span class="verse" rel="v043016008" id="016008" >8</span>
<span class="woc"> And he, when he comes, will bring conviction to the world as to sin, and as to righteousness, and as to judgment; </span><span class="verse" rel="v043016009" id="016009" >9</span>
<span class="woc"> as to sin, for people do not believe in me; </span><span class="verse" rel="v043016010" id="016010" >10</span>
<span class="woc"> as to righteousness, for I am going to the Father, and you will see me no longer; </span><span class="verse" rel="v043016011" id="016011" >11</span>
<span class="woc"> as to judgment, for the Spirit that is ruling this world has been condemned. </span><span class="verse" rel="v043016012" id="016012" >12</span>
<span class="woc"> I have still much to say to you, but you cannot bear it now. </span><span class="verse" rel="v043016013" id="016013" >13</span>
<span class="woc"> Yet when he – The Spirit of truth – comes, he will guide you into all truth; for he will not speak on his own authority, but he will speak of all that he hears; and he will tell you of the things that are to come. </span><span class="verse" rel="v043016014" id="016014" >14</span>
<span class="woc"> He will honor me; because he will take of what is mine, and will tell it to you. </span><span class="verse" rel="v043016015" id="016015" >15</span>
<span class="woc"> Everything that the Father has is mine; that is why I said that he takes of what is mine, and will tell it to you. </span><span class="verse" rel="v043016016" id="016016" >16</span>

<p><span class="verse" rel="v043016017" id="016017" >17</span>
 At this some of his disciples said to one another, “What does he mean by saying to us  <span class="woc"> ‘In a little while you will not see me, and then in a little while you will see me indeed’; </span>  and by saying  <span class="woc"> ‘Because I am going to the Father’? </span><span class="verse" rel="v043016018" id="016018" >18</span>
 What does he mean by  <span class="woc"> ‘In a little while’?” </span>  they said. “We do not know what he is speaking about.” <span class="verse" rel="v043016019" id="016019" >19</span>
 Jesus saw that they were wanting to ask him a question, and said,  <span class="woc"> “Are you trying to find out from one another what I meant by saying ‘In a little while you will not see me; and then in a little while you will see me indeed’? </span><span class="verse" rel="v043016020" id="016020" >20</span>
<span class="woc"> In truth I tell you that you will weep and mourn, but the world will rejoice; you will suffer pain, but your pain will turn to joy. </span><span class="verse" rel="v043016021" id="016021" >21</span>
<span class="woc"> A woman in labor is in pain because her time has come; but no sooner is the child born, than she forgets her trouble in her joy that a child has been born into the world. </span><span class="verse" rel="v043016022" id="016022" >22</span>
<span class="woc"> You, in the same way, are sorry now; but I will see you again, and your hearts will rejoice, and no one will rob you of your joy. </span><span class="verse" rel="v043016023" id="016023" >23</span>
<span class="woc"> And at that time you will not ask me anything; in truth I tell you, if you ask the Father for anything, he will grant it to you in my name. </span><span class="verse" rel="v043016024" id="016024" >24</span>
<span class="woc"> So far you have not asked for anything, in my name; ask, and you will receive, so that your joy may be complete. </span><span class="verse" rel="v043016025" id="016025" >25</span>
<span class="woc"> I have spoken to you of all this in figures; a time is coming, however, when I will not speak any longer to you in figures, but will tell you about the Father plainly. </span><span class="verse" rel="v043016026" id="016026" >26</span>
<span class="woc"> You will ask, at that time, in my name; and I do not say that I will intercede with the Father for you; </span><span class="verse" rel="v043016027" id="016027" >27</span>
<span class="woc"> for the Father himself loves you, because you have loved me, and have believed that I came from the Father. </span><span class="verse" rel="v043016028" id="016028" >28</span>

<!-- 016 028 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043016029" id="016029" >29</span>
 “At last,” exclaimed the disciples, “you are using plain words and not speaking in figures at all. <span class="verse" rel="v043016030" id="016030" >30</span>
 Now we are sure that you know everything, and need not wait for anyone to question you. This makes us believe that you did come from God.”

<p><span class="verse" rel="v043016031" id="016031" >31</span>
<span class="woc"> “Do you believe that already?” </span>  Jesus answered. <span class="verse" rel="v043016032" id="016032" >32</span>
<span class="woc"> “Listen! A time is coming – indeed it has already come – when you are to be scattered, each going his own way, and to leave me alone; and yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me. </span><span class="verse" rel="v043016033" id="016033" >33</span>

<p><span class="chapter" id="018001">18</span> When Jesus had said this, he went out with his disciples and crossed the Kidron ravine to a place where there was a garden, into which he and his disciples went. <span class="verse" rel="v043018002" id="018002" >2</span>
 The place was well known to Judas, the betrayer, for Jesus and his disciples had often met there. <span class="verse" rel="v043018003" id="018003" >3</span>
 So Judas, who had obtained the soldiers of the Roman garrison, and some guards from the chief priests and the Pharisees, came there with lanterns, torches, and weapons. <span class="verse" rel="v043018004" id="018004" >4</span>
 Jesus, aware of all that was coming upon him, went to meet them, and said to them,  <span class="woc"> “For whom are you looking?” </span>

<span class="woc"> “I have already told you that I am he,” </span>  replied Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “so, if it is for me that you are looking, let these people go.” </span><span class="verse" rel="v043018009" id="018009" >9</span>
 This was in fulfillment of his words –  <span class="woc"> ‘Of those whom you have given me I have not lost one.’ </span><span class="verse" rel="v043018010" id="018010" >10</span>
 At this, Simon Peter, who had a sword with him, drew it, and struck the high priest’s servant, and cut off his right ear. The servant’s name was Malchus. <span class="verse" rel="v043018011" id="018011" >11</span>
 But Jesus said to Peter,  <span class="woc"> “Sheathe your sword. Should I not drink the cup which the Father has given me?” </span><p><span class="verse" rel="v043018012" id="018012" >12</span>
 So the soldiers of the garrison, with their commanding officer and the Jewish guards, arrested Jesus and bound him, <span class="verse" rel="v043018013" id="018013" >13</span>
 and took him first of all to Annas. Annas was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, who was high priest that year. <span class="verse" rel="v043018014" id="018014" >14</span>
 It was Caiaphas who had counseled the religious authorities, that it was best that one person should die for the people. <span class="verse" rel="v043018015" id="018015" >15</span>
 Meanwhile Simon Peter followed Jesus, and so did another disciple. That disciple, being well-known to the high priest, went with Jesus into the high priest’s courtyard, <span class="verse" rel="v043018016" id="018016" >16</span>
 while Peter stood outside by the door. Presently the other disciple – the one well-known to the high priest – went out and spoke to the portress, and brought Peter in. <span class="verse" rel="v043018017" id="018017" >17</span>
 So the maidservant said to Peter, “Aren’t you also one of this man’s disciples?” 
<!-- 018 017 -->


<p>  “No, I am not,” he said. <span class="verse" rel="v043018018" id="018018" >18</span>
 The servants and guards were standing around a charcoal fire (which they had made because it was cold), and were warming themselves. Peter, too, was with them, standing and warming himself. <span class="verse" rel="v043018019" id="018019" >19</span>
 The high priest questioned Jesus about his disciples and about his teaching. <span class="verse" rel="v043018020" id="018020" >20</span>
<span class="woc"> “For my part,” </span>  answered Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “I have spoken to all the world openly. I always taught in some synagogue, or in the Temple Courts, places where everyone assembles, and I never spoke of anything in secret. </span><span class="verse" rel="v043018021" id="018021" >21</span>
<span class="woc"> Why question me? Question those who have listened to me as to what I have spoken about to them. They must know what I said.” </span><span class="verse" rel="v043018022" id="018022" >22</span>
 When Jesus said this, one of the guards, who was standing near, gave him a blow with his hand. “Do you answer the high priest like that?” he exclaimed. <span class="verse" rel="v043018023" id="018023" >23</span>
<span class="woc"> “If I said anything wrong, give evidence about it,” </span>  replied Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “but if not, why do you strike me?” </span><span class="verse" rel="v043018024" id="018024" >24</span>
 Annas sent him bound to Caiaphas the high priest. <span class="verse" rel="v043018025" id="018025" >25</span>
 Meanwhile Simon Peter was standing there, warming himself; so they said to him, “Aren’t you also one of his disciples?” Peter denied it. “No, I am not,” he said. <span class="verse" rel="v043018026" id="018026" >26</span>
 One of the high priest’s servants, a relation of the man whose ear Peter had cut off, exclaimed, “Didn’t I myself see you with him in the garden?” <span class="verse" rel="v043018027" id="018027" >27</span>
 Peter again denied it; and at that moment a cock crowed. <p>
<!-- 018 027 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043018028" id="018028" >28</span>
 From Caiaphas they took Jesus to the Government house. It was early in the morning. But they did not enter the Government house themselves, otherwise they might become defiled, and so be unable to eat the Passover. <span class="verse" rel="v043018029" id="018029" >29</span>
 Therefore Pilate came outside to speak to them. “What charge do you bring against this man?” he asked. <span class="verse" rel="v043018030" id="018030" >30</span>
 “If he had not been a criminal, we should not have given him up to you,” they answered. <span class="verse" rel="v043018031" id="018031" >31</span>
 “Take him yourselves,” said Pilate, “and try him by your own Law.” 
<!-- 018 031 -->


<p>  “We have no power to put anyone to death,” the authorities replied – <span class="verse" rel="v043018032" id="018032" >32</span>
 in fulfillment of what Jesus had said when indicating the death that he was destined to die. <span class="verse" rel="v043018033" id="018033" >33</span>
 After that, Pilate went into the Government house again, and calling Jesus up, asked him, “Are you the king of the Jews?” 
<!-- 018 033 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043018034" id="018034" >34</span>
<span class="woc"> “Do you ask me that yourself?” </span>  replied Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “or did others say it to you about me?” </span>
<!-- 018 034 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043018035" id="018035" >35</span>
 “Do you take me for a Jew?” was Pilate’s answer. “It is your own nation and the chief priests who have given you up to me. What have you done?” 
<!-- 018 035 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043018036" id="018036" >36</span>
<span class="woc"> “My kingly power,” </span>  replied Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “is not due to this world. If it had been so, my servants would be doing their utmost to prevent my being given up to the authorities; but my kingly power is not from the world.” </span>
<!-- 018 036 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043018037" id="018037" >37</span>
 “So you are a king after all!” exclaimed Pilate.  <span class="woc"> “Yes, it is true I am a king,” </span>  answered Jesus.  <span class="woc"> “I was born for this, I have come into the world for this – to bear testimony to the truth. Everyone who is on the side of truth listens to my voice.” </span>
<!-- 018 037 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043018038" id="018038" >38</span>
 “What is truth?” exclaimed Pilate. After saying this, he went out to the crowd again, and said, “For my part, I find nothing with which he can be charged. <span class="verse" rel="v043018039" id="018039" >39</span>
 It is, however, the custom for me to grant you the release of one man at the Passover Festival. Do you wish for the release of the king of the Jews?” 
<!-- 018 039 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043018040" id="018040" >40</span>
 “No, not this man,” they shouted again, “but Barabbas!” This Barabbas was a robber. <p>
<!-- 019 040 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="019001">19</span> After that, Pilate had Jesus scourged. <span class="verse" rel="v043019002" id="019002" >2</span>
 The soldiers made a crown with some thorns and put it on his head and threw a purple robe around him. <span class="verse" rel="v043019003" id="019003" >3</span>
 They kept coming up to him and saying, “Long live the king of the Jews!” and they gave him blow after blow with their hands. <span class="verse" rel="v043019004" id="019004" >4</span>
 Pilate again came outside, and said to the people, “Look! I am bringing him out to you, so that you may know that I find nothing with which he can be charged.” <span class="verse" rel="v043019005" id="019005" >5</span>
 Then Jesus came outside, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe; and Pilate said to them, “Here is the man!” <span class="verse" rel="v043019006" id="019006" >6</span>
 When the chief priests and the guards saw him, they shouted, “Crucify him! Crucify him!” 
<!-- 019 006 -->


<p>  “Take him yourselves and crucify him,” said Pilate. “For my part, I find nothing with which he can be charged.” 
<!-- 019 006 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043019007" id="019007" >7</span>
 “But we,” replied the crowd, “have a Law, under which he deserves death for making himself out to be the Son of God.” <span class="verse" rel="v043019008" id="019008" >8</span>
 When Pilate heard what they said, he became still more alarmed; <span class="verse" rel="v043019009" id="019009" >9</span>
 and, going into the Government house again, he said to Jesus, “Where do you come from?” <span class="verse" rel="v043019010" id="019010" >10</span>
 But Jesus made no reply. So Pilate said to him, “Do you refuse to speak to me? Don’t you know that I have power to release you, and have power to crucify you?” 
<!-- 019 010 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043019011" id="019011" >11</span>
<span class="woc"> “You would have no power over me at all,” </span>  answered Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “if it had not been given you from above; and, therefore, the man who betrayed me to you is guilty of the greater sin.” </span><span class="verse" rel="v043019012" id="019012" >12</span>
 This made Pilate anxious to release him; but the crowd shouted, “If you release that man, you are no friend of the Emperor! Anyone who makes himself out to be a king is setting himself against the Emperor!” <span class="verse" rel="v043019013" id="019013" >13</span>
 On hearing what they said, Pilate brought Jesus out, and took his seat on the Bench at a place called ‘The Stone Pavement’ – in Hebrew ‘Gabbatha.’ <span class="verse" rel="v043019014" id="019014" >14</span>
 It was the Passover Preparation day, and about noon. Then he said to the crowd, “Here is your king!” <span class="verse" rel="v043019015" id="019015" >15</span>
 At that the people shouted, “Kill him! Kill him! Crucify him!” 
<!-- 019 015 -->


<p>  “What! Should I crucify your king?” exclaimed Pilate. “We have no king but the Emperor,” replied the chief priests; <span class="verse" rel="v043019016" id="019016" >16</span>
 so Pilate gave Jesus up to them to be crucified. <p>
<!-- 019 016 -->


<p>  So they took Jesus; <span class="verse" rel="v043019017" id="019017" >17</span>
 and he went out, carrying his cross himself, to the place which is named from a skull, or, in Hebrew, Golgotha. <span class="verse" rel="v043019018" id="019018" >18</span>
 There they crucified him, and two others with him – one on each side, and Jesus between them. <span class="verse" rel="v043019019" id="019019" >19</span>
 Pilate also had these words written and put up over the cross – ‘JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS.’ <span class="verse" rel="v043019020" id="019020" >20</span>
 These words were read by many people, because the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city; and they were written in Hebrew, Latin and Greek. <span class="verse" rel="v043019021" id="019021" >21</span>
 The chief priests said to Pilate, “Do not write ‘The king of the Jews’, but write what the man said – ‘I am the king of the Jews.’” <span class="verse" rel="v043019022" id="019022" >22</span>
 But Pilate answered, “What I have written, I have written.” <p>
<!-- 019 022 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043019023" id="019023" >23</span>
 When the soldiers had crucified Jesus, they took his clothes and divided them into four shares – a share for each soldier – and they took the coat also. The coat had no seam, being woven in one piece from top to bottom. <span class="verse" rel="v043019024" id="019024" >24</span>
 So they said to one another, “Do not let us tear it, but let us cast lots for it, to see who will have it.” This was in fulfillment of the words of scripture – 
<p class="indent1">  ‘They shared my clothes among them, 
<p class="indent2">  and over my clothing they cast lots.’ 
<!-- 019 024 -->


<p>  That was what the soldiers did. <span class="verse" rel="v043019025" id="019025" >25</span>
 Meanwhile near the cross of Jesus were standing his mother and his mother’s sister, as well as Mary the wife of Clopas and Mary of Magdala. <span class="verse" rel="v043019026" id="019026" >26</span>
 When Jesus saw his mother, and the disciple whom he loved, standing near, he said to his mother,  <span class="woc"> “There is your son.” </span><span class="verse" rel="v043019027" id="019027" >27</span>
 Then he said to that disciple,  <span class="woc"> “There is your mother.” </span>  And from that very hour the disciple took her to live in his house. <p>
<!-- 019 027 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043019028" id="019028" >28</span>
 Afterward, knowing that everything was now finished, Jesus said, in fulfillment of the words of scripture,  <span class="woc"> “I am thirsty.” </span><span class="verse" rel="v043019029" id="019029" >29</span>
 There was a bowl standing there full of common wine; so they put a sponge soaked in the wine on the end of a hyssop-stalk, and held it up to his mouth. <span class="verse" rel="v043019030" id="019030" >30</span>
 When Jesus had received the wine, he exclaimed,  <span class="woc"> “All is finished!” </span>  Then, bowing his head, he resigned his spirit to God. <span class="verse" rel="v043019031" id="019031" >31</span>
 It was the Preparation day, and so, to prevent the bodies from remaining on the crosses during the Sabbath (for that Sabbath was a great day), the Jews asked Pilate to have the legs broken and the bodies removed. <span class="verse" rel="v043019032" id="019032" >32</span>
 Accordingly the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first man, and then those of the other who had been crucified with Jesus; <span class="verse" rel="v043019033" id="019033" >33</span>
 but, on coming to him, when they saw that he was already dead, they did not break his legs. <span class="verse" rel="v043019034" id="019034" >34</span>
 One of the soldiers, however, pierced his side with a spear, and blood and water immediately flowed from it. <span class="verse" rel="v043019035" id="019035" >35</span>
 This is the statement of one who actually saw it – and his statement may be relied on, and he knows that he is speaking the truth – and it is given in order that you also may be convinced. <span class="verse" rel="v043019036" id="019036" >36</span>
 For all this happened in fulfillment of the words of scripture – ‘Not one of its bones will be broken.’ <span class="verse" rel="v043019037" id="019037" >37</span>
 And there is another passage which says – ‘They will look on him whom they pierced.’ <span class="verse" rel="v043019038" id="019038" >38</span>
 After this, Joseph of Arimathea, a disciple of Jesus – but a secret one, owing to his fear of the religious authorities – begged Pilate’s permission to remove the body of Jesus. Pilate gave him leave; so Joseph went and removed the body. <span class="verse" rel="v043019039" id="019039" >39</span>
 Nicodemus, too – the man who had formerly visited Jesus by night – came with a roll of myrrh and aloes, weighing nearly a hundred pounds. <span class="verse" rel="v043019040" id="019040" >40</span>
 They took the body of Jesus, and wound it in linen with the spices, according to the Jewish mode of burial. <span class="verse" rel="v043019041" id="019041" >41</span>
 At the place where Jesus had been crucified there was a garden, and in the garden a newly made tomb in which no one had ever been laid. <span class="verse" rel="v043019042" id="019042" >42</span>
 And so, because of its being the Preparation day, and as the tomb was close at hand, they laid Jesus there. 
<h6>The Risen Life</h6>
<!-- 020 042 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="020001">20</span> On the first day of the week, early in the morning, while it was still dark, Mary of Magdala went to the tomb, and saw that the stone had been removed. <span class="verse" rel="v043020002" id="020002" >2</span>
 So she came running to Simon Peter, and to that other disciple who was Jesus’ friend, and said to them, “They have taken away the Master out of the tomb, and we do not know where they have laid him!” <span class="verse" rel="v043020003" id="020003" >3</span>
 So, Peter started off with that other disciple, and they went to the tomb. <span class="verse" rel="v043020004" id="020004" >4</span>
 The two began running together; but the other disciple ran faster than Peter, and reached the tomb first. <span class="verse" rel="v043020005" id="020005" >5</span>
 Stooping down, he saw the linen wrappings lying there, but did not go in. <span class="verse" rel="v043020006" id="020006" >6</span>
 Presently Simon Peter came following behind him, and went into the tomb; and he looked at the linen wrappings lying there, <span class="verse" rel="v043020007" id="020007" >7</span>
 and the cloth which had been on Jesus’ head, not lying with the wrappings, but rolled up on one side, separately. <span class="verse" rel="v043020008" id="020008" >8</span>
 Then the other disciple, who had reached the tomb first, went inside too, and he saw for himself and was convinced. <span class="verse" rel="v043020009" id="020009" >9</span>
 For they did not then understand the passage of scripture which says that Jesus must rise again from the dead. <span class="verse" rel="v043020010" id="020010" >10</span>
 The disciples then returned to their companions. 
<!-- 020 010 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043020011" id="020011" >11</span>
 Meanwhile Mary was standing close outside the tomb, weeping. Still weeping, she leant forward into the tomb, <span class="verse" rel="v043020012" id="020012" >12</span>
 and perceived two angels clothed in white sitting there, where the body of Jesus had been lying, one where the head and the other where the feet had been. <span class="verse" rel="v043020013" id="020013" >13</span>
 “Why are you weeping?” asked the angels. “They have taken my Master away,” she answered, “and I do not know where they have laid him.” <span class="verse" rel="v043020014" id="020014" >14</span>
 After saying this, she turned around, and looked at Jesus standing there, but she did not know that it was Jesus. <span class="verse" rel="v043020015" id="020015" >15</span>
<span class="woc"> “Why are you weeping? Whom are you seeking?” </span>  he asked. Supposing him to be the gardener, Mary answered, “If it was you, Sir, who carried him away, tell me where you have laid him, and I will take him away myself.” 
<!-- 020 015 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043020016" id="020016" >16</span>
<span class="woc"> “Mary!” </span>  said Jesus. She turned around, and exclaimed in Hebrew, “Rabboni!” (or, as we should say, ‘teacher’). <span class="verse" rel="v043020017" id="020017" >17</span>
<span class="woc"> “Do not hold me,” </span>  Jesus said,  <span class="woc"> “for I have not yet ascended to the Father. But go to my brothers, and tell them that I am ascending to him who is my Father and their Father, my God and their God.” </span><span class="verse" rel="v043020018" id="020018" >18</span>
 Mary of Magdala went and told the disciples that she had seen the Master, and that he had said this to her. <p>
<!-- 020 018 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043020019" id="020019" >19</span>
 In the evening of the same day – the first day of the week – after the doors of the room, in which the disciples were, had been shut because they were afraid of the religious authorities, Jesus came and stood among them and said,  <span class="woc"> “Peace be with you”; </span><span class="verse" rel="v043020020" id="020020" >20</span>
 after which he showed them his hands and his side. The disciples were filled with joy when they saw the Master. <span class="verse" rel="v043020021" id="020021" >21</span>
 Again Jesus said to them,  <span class="woc"> “Peace be with you. As the Father has sent me as his messenger, so I am sending you.” </span><span class="verse" rel="v043020022" id="020022" >22</span>
 After saying this, he breathed on them, and said,  <span class="woc"> “Receive the Holy Spirit; </span><span class="verse" rel="v043020023" id="020023" >23</span>
<span class="woc"> if you remit anyone’s sins, they have been remitted; and, if you retain them, they have been retained.” </span><p>
<!-- 020 023 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043020024" id="020024" >24</span>
 But Thomas, one of the Twelve, called ‘The Twin,’ was not with them when Jesus came; <span class="verse" rel="v043020025" id="020025" >25</span>
 so the rest of the disciples said to him, “We have seen the Master!” 
<!-- 020 025 -->


<p>  “Unless I see the marks of the nails in his hands,” he exclaimed, “and put my finger into the marks, and put my hand into his side, I will not believe it.” <span class="verse" rel="v043020026" id="020026" >26</span>
 A week later the disciples were again in the house, and Thomas was with them. After the doors had been shut, Jesus came and stood among them, and said,  <span class="woc"> “Peace be with you.” </span><span class="verse" rel="v043020027" id="020027" >27</span>
 Then he said to Thomas,  <span class="woc"> “Place your finger here, and look at my hands; and place your hand here, and put it into my side; and do not refuse to believe, but believe.” </span><span class="verse" rel="v043020028" id="020028" >28</span>
 And Thomas exclaimed, “My Master, and my God!” 
<!-- 020 028 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043020029" id="020029" >29</span>
<span class="woc"> “Is it because you have seen me that you have believed?” </span>  said Jesus.  <span class="woc"> “Blessed are they who have not seen, and yet have believed!” </span><p>
<!-- 020 029 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043020030" id="020030" >30</span>
 There were many other signs of his mission that Jesus gave in presence of the disciples, which are not recorded in this book; <span class="verse" rel="v043020031" id="020031" >31</span>
 but these have been recorded so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God – and that, through your belief in his name, you may have life. <p>
<!-- 021 031 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="021001">21</span> Later on, Jesus showed himself again to the disciples by the Sea of Tiberias. <span class="verse" rel="v043021002" id="021002" >2</span>
 It was in this way, – Simon Peter, Thomas, who was called ‘The Twin,’ Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, Zebedee’s sons, and two other disciples of Jesus, were together, when Simon Peter said, <span class="verse" rel="v043021003" id="021003" >3</span>
 “I am going fishing.”

<p>  “We will come with you,” said the others. They went out and got into the boat, but caught nothing that night. <span class="verse" rel="v043021004" id="021004" >4</span>
 Just as day was breaking, Jesus came and stood on the beach; but the disciples did not know that it was he. <span class="verse" rel="v043021005" id="021005" >5</span>
<span class="woc"> “My children,” </span>  he said,  <span class="woc"> “have you anything to eat?” </span>
<!-- 021 005 -->


<p>  “No,” they answered. <span class="verse" rel="v043021006" id="021006" >6</span>
<span class="woc"> “Cast your net to the right of the boat,” </span>  he said,  <span class="woc"> “and you will find fish.” </span>  So they cast the net, and now they could not haul it in because of the quantity of fish. <span class="verse" rel="v043021007" id="021007" >7</span>
 The disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, “It is the Master!” When Simon Peter heard that it was the Master, he fastened his coat around him (for he had taken it off), and threw himself into the sea. <span class="verse" rel="v043021008" id="021008" >8</span>
 But the rest of the disciples came in the boat (for they were only about a hundred yards from shore), dragging the net full of fish. <span class="verse" rel="v043021009" id="021009" >9</span>
 When they had come ashore, they found a charcoal fire ready, with some fish already on it, and some bread as well. <span class="verse" rel="v043021010" id="021010" >10</span>
<span class="woc"> “Bring some of the fish which you have just caught,” </span>  said Jesus. <span class="verse" rel="v043021011" id="021011" >11</span>
 So Simon Peter got into the boat and hauled the net ashore full of large fish, a hundred and fifty-three of them; and yet, although there were so many, the net had not been torn. <span class="verse" rel="v043021012" id="021012" >12</span>
<span class="woc"> “Come and have breakfast.” </span> , Jesus said. None of the disciples dared ask him who he was, because they knew it was the Master. <span class="verse" rel="v043021013" id="021013" >13</span>
 Jesus went and took the bread and gave it to them, and the fish too. <span class="verse" rel="v043021014" id="021014" >14</span>
 This was the third time that Jesus showed himself to the disciples after he had risen from the dead. <p>
<!-- 021 014 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043021015" id="021015" >15</span>
 When breakfast was over, Jesus said to Simon Peter,  <span class="woc"> “Simon, son of John, do you love me more than the others?” </span>
<!-- 021 015 -->


<p>  “Yes, Master,” he answered, “you know that I am your friend.” 
<!-- 021 015 -->


<p>   <span class="woc"> “Feed my lambs,” </span>  said Jesus. <span class="verse" rel="v043021016" id="021016" >16</span>
 Then, a second time, Jesus asked,  <span class="woc"> “Simon, son of John, do you love me?” </span>
<!-- 021 016 -->


<p>  “Yes, Master,” he answered, “you know that I am your friend.” 
<!-- 021 016 -->


<p>   <span class="woc"> “Tend my sheep,” </span>  said Jesus. <span class="verse" rel="v043021017" id="021017" >17</span>
 The third time, Jesus said to him,  <span class="woc"> “Simon, son of John, are you my friend?” </span>  Peter was hurt at his third question being ‘Are you my friend?’; and exclaimed, “Master, you know everything! You can tell that I am your friend.” 
<!-- 021 017 -->


<p>   <span class="woc"> “Feed my sheep,” </span>  said Jesus. <span class="verse" rel="v043021018" id="021018" >18</span>
<span class="woc"> “In truth I tell you,” he continued, “when you were young, you used to put on your own clothes, and walk wherever you wished; but, when you have grown old, you will have to stretch out your hands, while someone else puts on your clothes, and takes you where you do not wish.” </span><span class="verse" rel="v043021019" id="021019" >19</span>
 Jesus said this to show the death by which Peter was to honor God, and then he added,  <span class="woc"> “Follow me.” </span><span class="verse" rel="v043021020" id="021020" >20</span>
 Peter turned around, and saw the disciple whom Jesus loved following – the one who at the supper leant back on the Master’s shoulder, and asked him who it was who would betray him. <span class="verse" rel="v043021021" id="021021" >21</span>
 Seeing him, Peter said to Jesus, “Master, what about this man?” 
<!-- 021 021 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043021022" id="021022" >22</span>
<span class="woc"> “If it is my will that he should wait until I come,” </span>  answered Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “what has that to do with you? Follow me yourself.” </span><span class="verse" rel="v043021023" id="021023" >23</span>
 So the report spread among his followers that that disciple was not to die; yet Jesus did not say that he was not to die, but said  <span class="woc"> “If it is my will that he should wait until I come, what has that to do with you?” </span><p>
<!-- 021 023 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043021024" id="021024" >24</span>
 It is this disciple who states these things, and who recorded them; and we know that his statement is true. <p>
<!-- 021 024 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v043021025" id="021025" >25</span>
 There are many other things which Jesus did; but, if every one of them were to be recorded in detail, I suppose that even the world itself would not hold the books that would be written.

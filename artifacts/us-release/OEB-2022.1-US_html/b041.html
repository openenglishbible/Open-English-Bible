<h2>The</h2>
<h2>Good News According to</h2>
<h1>Mark</h1>
<h6>The Preparation</h6>
<!-- 001 001 -->


<p class="smallcappara"><span class="chapter" id="001001">1</span><span class="dropcap">T</span>he beginning of the good news about Jesus Christ. 
<!-- 001 001 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v041001002" id="001002" >2</span>
 It is said in the prophet Isaiah – 
<p class="indent1">  ‘I am sending my messenger ahead of you; 
<p class="indent2">  he will prepare your way. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v041001003" id="001003" >3</span>
 The voice of one crying aloud in the wilderness: 
<p class="indent2">  “Prepare the road for the Lord, 
<p class="indent3">  make a straight path for him.”’ 
<!-- 001 003 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v041001004" id="001004" >4</span>
 John the Baptizer appeared in the wilderness, proclaiming a baptism on repentance, for the forgiveness of sins. <span class="verse" rel="v041001005" id="001005" >5</span>
 The whole of Judea, as well as all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, went out to him; and they were baptized by him in the Jordan River, confessing their sins. 
<!-- 001 005 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v041001006" id="001006" >6</span>
 John wore clothes made of camels’ hair, with a leather strap around his waist, and lived on locusts and wild honey; <span class="verse" rel="v041001007" id="001007" >7</span>
 and he proclaimed – “After me is coming someone more powerful than I am, and I am not fit even to stoop down and unfasten his sandals. <span class="verse" rel="v041001008" id="001008" >8</span>
 I have baptized you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.” 
<!-- 001 008 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v041001009" id="001009" >9</span>
 Now about that time Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee, and was baptized by John in the Jordan. <span class="verse" rel="v041001010" id="001010" >10</span>
 Just as he was coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens split open and the Spirit coming down to him like a dove, <span class="verse" rel="v041001011" id="001011" >11</span>
 and from the heavens came a voice – “You are my dearly loved son; you bring me great joy.” 
<!-- 001 011 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v041001012" id="001012" >12</span>
 Immediately afterward the Spirit drove Jesus out into the wilderness; <span class="verse" rel="v041001013" id="001013" >13</span>
 and he was there in the wilderness forty days, tempted by Satan, and among the wild beasts, while the angels helped him. 
<h6>The Work in Galilee</h6>
<!-- 001 013 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v041001014" id="001014" >14</span>
 After John had been arrested, Jesus went to Galilee, proclaiming the good news of God – <span class="verse" rel="v041001015" id="001015" >15</span>
<span class="woc"> “The time has come, and the kingdom of God is at hand; repent, and believe the good news.” </span>
<!-- 001 015 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v041001016" id="001016" >16</span>
 As Jesus was going along the shore of the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and his brother Andrew casting a net in the sea, for they were fishermen. <span class="verse" rel="v041001017" id="001017" >17</span>
<span class="woc"> “Come and follow me,” </span>  Jesus said,  <span class="woc"> “and I will teach you to fish for people.” </span><span class="verse" rel="v041001018" id="001018" >18</span>
 They left their nets at once, and followed him. 
<!-- 001 018 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v041001019" id="001019" >19</span>
 Going on a little further, he saw James, Zebedee’s son, and his brother John, who were in their boat mending the nets. <span class="verse" rel="v041001020" id="001020" >20</span>
 Jesus called them at once, and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the crew, and went after him. 
<!-- 001 020 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v041001021" id="001021" >21</span>
 They walked to Capernaum. On the next Sabbath Jesus went into the synagogue and began to teach. <span class="verse" rel="v041001022" id="001022" >22</span>
 The people were amazed at his teaching, for he taught them like one who had authority, and not like the teachers of the Law. <span class="verse" rel="v041001023" id="001023" >23</span>
 Now there was in their synagogue at the time a man under the power of a foul spirit, who called out, <span class="verse" rel="v041001024" id="001024" >24</span>
 “What do you want with us, Jesus the Nazarene? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are – the Holy One of God!” <span class="verse" rel="v041001025" id="001025" >25</span>
 But Jesus rebuked the spirit,  <span class="woc"> “Be silent! Come out from him.” </span><span class="verse" rel="v041001026" id="001026" >26</span>
 The foul spirit threw the man into a fit, and with a loud cry came out from him. <span class="verse" rel="v041001027" id="001027" >27</span>
 They were all so amazed that they kept asking each other, “What is this? What is this, a new kind of teaching? He gives his commands with authority even to the foul spirits, and they obey him!” <span class="verse" rel="v041001028" id="001028" >28</span>
 His fame spread at once in all directions, through the whole region of Galilee. 
<!-- 001 028 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v041001029" id="001029" >29</span>
 As soon as they had left the synagogue, they went to the house of Simon and Andrew, along with James and John. <span class="verse" rel="v041001030" id="001030" >30</span>
 Now Simon’s mother-in-law was lying ill with a fever, and they at once told Jesus about her. <span class="verse" rel="v041001031" id="001031" >31</span>
 Jesus went up to her and, grasping her hand, raised her up; the fever left her, and she began to take care of them. 
<!-- 001 031 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v041001032" id="001032" >32</span>
 In the evening, after sunset, the people brought to Jesus all who were ill or possessed by demons; <span class="verse" rel="v041001033" id="001033" >33</span>
 and the whole city was gathered around the door. <span class="verse" rel="v041001034" id="001034" >34</span>
 Jesus cured many who were ill with various diseases, and drove out many demons, and would not permit them to speak, because they knew him to be the Christ. 
<!-- 001 034 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v041001035" id="001035" >35</span>
 In the morning, long before daylight, Jesus got up and went out to a lonely spot, where he began to pray. <span class="verse" rel="v041001036" id="001036" >36</span>
 But Simon and his companions went out searching for him; <span class="verse" rel="v041001037" id="001037" >37</span>
 and, when they found him, they exclaimed, “Everyone is looking for you!” <span class="verse" rel="v041001038" id="001038" >38</span>
 But Jesus said to them,  <span class="woc"> “Let us go somewhere else, into the country towns nearby so that I can make my proclamation in them also; for that was why I came.” </span><span class="verse" rel="v041001039" id="001039" >39</span>
 And he went about making his proclamation in their synagogues all through Galilee, and driving out the demons. 
<!-- 001 039 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v041001040" id="001040" >40</span>
 One day a leper came to Jesus and, falling on his knees, begged him for help. “If only you are willing,” he said, “you are able to make me clean.” <span class="verse" rel="v041001041" id="001041" >41</span>
 Moved with compassion, Jesus stretched out his hand and touched him, saying as he did so,  <span class="woc"> “I am willing; become clean.” </span><span class="verse" rel="v041001042" id="001042" >42</span>
 Instantly the leprosy left the man, and he became clean; <span class="verse" rel="v041001043" id="001043" >43</span>
 and then Jesus, after sternly warning him, immediately sent him away, <span class="verse" rel="v041001044" id="001044" >44</span>
 and said to him,  <span class="woc"> “Be careful not to say anything to anyone; but go and show yourself to the priest, and make the offerings for your cleansing directed by Moses, as evidence of your cure.” </span><span class="verse" rel="v041001045" id="001045" >45</span>
 The man, however, went away, and began to speak about it publicly, and to spread the story so widely, that Jesus could no longer go openly into a town, but stayed outside in lonely places; and people came to him from every direction. 
<!-- 002 045 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="002001">2</span> Some days later, when Jesus came back to Capernaum, the news spread that he was in a house there; <span class="verse" rel="v041002002" id="002002" >2</span>
 and so many people collected together, that after a while there was no room for them even around the door; and he began to tell them his message. <span class="verse" rel="v041002003" id="002003" >3</span>
 Some people came, bringing to him a paralyzed man, who was being carried by four of them. <span class="verse" rel="v041002004" id="002004" >4</span>
 They were unable to get him near to Jesus, because of the crowd, so they removed the roof above Jesus, and, when they had made an opening, they let down the mat on which the paralyzed man was lying. <span class="verse" rel="v041002005" id="002005" >5</span>
 When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the man,  <span class="woc"> “Child, your sins are forgiven.” </span>
<!-- 002 005 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v041002006" id="002006" >6</span>
 But some of the teachers of the Law who were sitting there were debating in their minds, <span class="verse" rel="v041002007" id="002007" >7</span>
 “Why does this man speak like this? He is blaspheming! Who can forgive sins except God?” <span class="verse" rel="v041002008" id="002008" >8</span>
 Jesus, at once intuitively aware that they were debating with themselves in this way, said to them,  <span class="woc"> “Why are you debating in your minds about this? </span><span class="verse" rel="v041002009" id="002009" >9</span>
<span class="woc"> Which is easier? – to say to the paralyzed man, ‘Your sins are forgiven’? Or to say ‘Get up, and take up your mat, and walk’? </span><span class="verse" rel="v041002010" id="002010" >10</span>
<span class="woc"> But so you may know that the Son of Man has power to forgive sins on earth” </span>  – here he said to the paralyzed man – <span class="verse" rel="v041002011" id="002011" >11</span>
<span class="woc"> “To you I say, Get up, take up your mat, and return to your home.” </span><span class="verse" rel="v041002012" id="002012" >12</span>
 The man got up, and immediately took up his mat, and went out before them all; at which they were amazed, and, as they praised God, they said, “We have never seen anything like this!” 
<!-- 002 012 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v041002013" id="002013" >13</span>
 Jesus went out again to the sea; and all the people came to him, and he taught them. <span class="verse" rel="v041002014" id="002014" >14</span>
 As he went along, he saw Levi, the son of Alphaeus, sitting in the tax office, and said to him,  <span class="woc"> “Follow me.” </span>  Levi got up and followed him. 
<!-- 002 014 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v041002015" id="002015" >15</span>
 Later on he was in his house having dinner, and a number of tax collectors and outcasts took their places at the table with Jesus and his disciples; for many of them were following him. <span class="verse" rel="v041002016" id="002016" >16</span>
 When the teachers of the Law belonging to the party of the Pharisees saw that he was eating in the company of such people, they said to his disciples, “Why does he eat with the tax collectors and outcasts?” <span class="verse" rel="v041002017" id="002017" >17</span>
 Hearing this, Jesus said,  <span class="woc"> “It is not those who are healthy who need a doctor, but those who are ill. I did not come to call the religious, but the outcast.” </span>
<!-- 002 017 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v041002018" id="002018" >18</span>
 Now John’s disciples and the Pharisees were fasting, and people came and asked Jesus, “Why is it that John’s disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees fast, while yours do not?” <span class="verse" rel="v041002019" id="002019" >19</span>
 Jesus answered,  <span class="woc"> “Can the groom’s friends fast, while the groom is with them? As long as they have the groom with them, they cannot fast. </span><span class="verse" rel="v041002020" id="002020" >20</span>
<span class="woc"> But the days will come, when the groom will be taken away from them, and they will fast then – when that day comes.” </span>
<!-- 002 020 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v041002021" id="002021" >21</span>
<span class="woc"> “No one ever sews a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment; if they do, the patch tears away from it – the new from the old – and a worse tear is made. </span><span class="verse" rel="v041002022" id="002022" >22</span>
<span class="woc"> And no one ever puts new wine into old wine-skins; if they do, the wine will burst the skins, and both the wine and the skins are lost. But new wine is put into fresh skins.” </span>
<!-- 002 022 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v041002023" id="002023" >23</span>
 One Sabbath, as Jesus was walking through the cornfields, his disciples began to pick the ears of wheat as they went along. <span class="verse" rel="v041002024" id="002024" >24</span>
 “Look!” the Pharisees said to him, “why are they doing what is not allowed on the Sabbath?” 
<!-- 002 024 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v041002025" id="002025" >25</span>
<span class="woc"> “Have you never read,” </span>  answered Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “what David did when he was in need and hungry, he and his companions – </span><span class="verse" rel="v041002026" id="002026" >26</span>
<span class="woc"> how he went into the house of God, in the time of Abiathar the high priest, and ate the consecrated bread, which only the priests are allowed to eat, and gave some to his comrades as well?” </span>
<!-- 002 026 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v041002027" id="002027" >27</span>
 Then Jesus added,  <span class="woc"> “The Sabbath was made for people, and not people for the Sabbath; </span><span class="verse" rel="v041002028" id="002028" >28</span>
<span class="woc"> so the Son of Man is lord even of the Sabbath.” </span>
<!-- 003 028 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="003001">3</span> On another occasion Jesus went in to a synagogue, where there was a man whose hand was withered. <span class="verse" rel="v041003002" id="003002" >2</span>
 And they watched Jesus closely, to see if he would cure the man on the Sabbath, so that they might have a charge to bring against him. <span class="verse" rel="v041003003" id="003003" >3</span>
<span class="woc"> “Stand out in the middle,” </span>  Jesus said to the man with the withered hand; <span class="verse" rel="v041003004" id="003004" >4</span>
 and to the people he said,  <span class="woc"> “Is it allowable to do good at the Sabbath – or harm? To save a life, or destroy it?” </span><span class="verse" rel="v041003005" id="003005" >5</span>
 As they remained silent, Jesus looked around at them in anger, grieving at the hardness of their hearts, and said to the man,  <span class="woc"> “Stretch out your hand.” </span>  The man stretched it out; and his hand had become sound. <span class="verse" rel="v041003006" id="003006" >6</span>
 Immediately on leaving the synagogue, the Pharisees and the Herodians united in laying a plot against Jesus, to put him to death. <p>
<!-- 003 006 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v041003007" id="003007" >7</span>
 Then Jesus went away with his disciples to the sea, followed by a great number of people from Galilee. <span class="verse" rel="v041003008" id="003008" >8</span>
 A great number, hearing of all that he was doing, came to him from Judea, from Jerusalem, from Edom, from beyond the Jordan, and from the country around Tyre and Sidon. <span class="verse" rel="v041003009" id="003009" >9</span>
 So Jesus told his disciples to keep a small boat close by, so that the crowd would not crush him. <span class="verse" rel="v041003010" id="003010" >10</span>
 For he had cured many of them, and so people kept crowding around him, so all who were sick might touch him. <span class="verse" rel="v041003011" id="003011" >11</span>
 The foul spirits, too, whenever they caught sight of him, flung themselves down before him, and screamed out, “You are the Son of God”! <span class="verse" rel="v041003012" id="003012" >12</span>
 But he repeatedly warned them not to make him known. 
<!-- 003 012 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v041003013" id="003013" >13</span>
 Jesus made his way up the hill, and called those whom he wished; and they went to him. <span class="verse" rel="v041003014" id="003014" >14</span>
 He appointed twelve – whom he also named ‘apostles’ – so that they might be with him, and that he might send them out as his messengers, to preach, <span class="verse" rel="v041003015" id="003015" >15</span>
 and with power to drive out demons. <span class="verse" rel="v041003016" id="003016" >16</span>
 So he appointed the Twelve – Peter (which was the name that Jesus gave to Simon), <span class="verse" rel="v041003017" id="003017" >17</span>
 James, the son of Zebedee, and his brother John (to whom he gave the name of Boanerges, which means the Thunderers), <span class="verse" rel="v041003018" id="003018" >18</span>
 Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon the Zealot, <span class="verse" rel="v041003019" id="003019" >19</span>
 and Judas Iscariot, the man who betrayed him. 
<!-- 003 019 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v041003020" id="003020" >20</span>
 Jesus went into a house; and again a crowd collected, so that they were not even able to eat their food. <span class="verse" rel="v041003021" id="003021" >21</span>
 When his relatives heard of it, they went to take charge of him, for they said that he was out of his mind. 
<!-- 003 021 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v041003022" id="003022" >22</span>
 The teachers of the Law, who had come down from Jerusalem, said, “He has Beelzebul in him! He drives the demons out by the help of their chief.” <span class="verse" rel="v041003023" id="003023" >23</span>
 So Jesus called them to him, and answered them in parables,  <span class="woc"> “How can Satan drive out Satan? </span><span class="verse" rel="v041003024" id="003024" >24</span>
<span class="woc"> When a kingdom is divided against itself, it cannot last; </span><span class="verse" rel="v041003025" id="003025" >25</span>
<span class="woc"> and when a household is divided against itself, it will not be able to last. </span><span class="verse" rel="v041003026" id="003026" >26</span>
<span class="woc"> So, if Satan is in revolt against himself and is divided, he cannot last – his end has come! </span>
<!-- 003 026 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v041003027" id="003027" >27</span>
<span class="woc"> “No man who has broken into a strong man’s house can carry off his goods, without first tying him up; and not until then will he plunder his house. </span><span class="verse" rel="v041003028" id="003028" >28</span>
<span class="woc"> I tell you that people will be forgiven everything – their sins, and all the slanders that they utter; </span><span class="verse" rel="v041003029" id="003029" >29</span>
<span class="woc"> but whoever slanders the Holy Spirit remains unforgiven to the end; he has to answer for an enduring sin.” </span><span class="verse" rel="v041003030" id="003030" >30</span>
 This was said in reply to the charge that he had a foul spirit in him. <span class="verse" rel="v041003031" id="003031" >31</span>
 His mother and his brothers came, and stood outside, and sent to ask him to come to them. <span class="verse" rel="v041003032" id="003032" >32</span>
 There was a crowd sitting around Jesus, and some of them said to him, “Look, your mother and your brothers are outside, asking for you.” 
<!-- 003 032 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v041003033" id="003033" >33</span>
<span class="woc"> “Who is my mother? And my brothers?” </span>  was his reply. <span class="verse" rel="v041003034" id="003034" >34</span>
 Then he looked around on the people sitting in a circle around him, and said,  <span class="woc"> “Here are my mother and my brothers! </span><span class="verse" rel="v041003035" id="003035" >35</span>
<span class="woc"> Whoever does the will of God is my brother and sister and mother.” </span><p>
<!-- 004 035 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="004001">4</span> Jesus again began to teach by the sea; and, as an immense crowd was gathering around him, he got into a boat, and sat in it on the sea, while all the people were on the shore at the water’s edge. 
<!-- 004 001 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v041004002" id="004002" >2</span>
 Then he taught them many truths in parables; and in the course of his teaching he said to them: 
<!-- 004 002 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v041004003" id="004003" >3</span>
<span class="woc"> “Listen! The sower went out to sow; </span><span class="verse" rel="v041004004" id="004004" >4</span>
<span class="woc"> and presently, as he was sowing, some of the seed fell along the path; and the birds came, and ate it up. </span><span class="verse" rel="v041004005" id="004005" >5</span>
<span class="woc"> Some fell on rocky ground, where it had not much soil, and, because the soil wasn’t deep, sprang up at once; </span><span class="verse" rel="v041004006" id="004006" >6</span>
<span class="woc"> but, when the sun rose, it was scorched, and, because their roots were not deep enough, withered away. </span><span class="verse" rel="v041004007" id="004007" >7</span>
<span class="woc"> Some of the seed fell among brambles; but the brambles shot up and completely choked it, and it yielded no return. </span><span class="verse" rel="v041004008" id="004008" >8</span>
<span class="woc"> Some fell into good soil, and, shooting up and growing, yielded a return, amounting to thirty, sixty, and even a hundred fold.” </span><span class="verse" rel="v041004009" id="004009" >9</span>
 And Jesus said,  <span class="woc"> “Let anyone who has ears to hear with hear.” </span>
<!-- 004 009 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v041004010" id="004010" >10</span>
 Afterward, when he was alone, his followers and the Twelve asked him about his parables; <span class="verse" rel="v041004011" id="004011" >11</span>
 and he said,  <span class="woc"> “To you the hidden truth of the kingdom of God has been imparted; but to those who are outside it all teaching takes the form of parables so that – </span><span class="verse" rel="v041004012" id="004012" >12</span>
<span class="woc"> ‘Though they have eyes, they may see without perceiving; and though they have ears, they may hear without understanding; otherwise some day they might turn and be forgiven.’” </span>
<!-- 004 012 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v041004013" id="004013" >13</span>
<span class="woc"> “You do not know the meaning of this parable?” </span>  he went on,  <span class="woc"> “Then how will you understand all the other parables? </span><span class="verse" rel="v041004014" id="004014" >14</span>
<span class="woc"> The sower sows the message. </span><span class="verse" rel="v041004015" id="004015" >15</span>
<span class="woc"> The people meant by the seed that falls along the path are these – where the message is sown, but, as soon as they have heard it, Satan immediately comes and carries away the message that has been sown in them. </span><span class="verse" rel="v041004016" id="004016" >16</span>
<span class="woc"> So, too, those meant by the seed sown on the rocky places are the people who, when they have heard the message, at once accept it joyfully; </span><span class="verse" rel="v041004017" id="004017" >17</span>
<span class="woc"> but, as they have no root, they stand only for a short time; and so, when trouble or persecution arises because of the message, they fall away at once. </span><span class="verse" rel="v041004018" id="004018" >18</span>
<span class="woc"> Those meant by the seed sown among the brambles are different; they are the people who hear the message, </span><span class="verse" rel="v041004019" id="004019" >19</span>
<span class="woc"> but the cares of life, and the glamour of wealth, and cravings for many other things come in and completely choke the message, so that it gives no return. </span><span class="verse" rel="v041004020" id="004020" >20</span>
<span class="woc"> But the people meant by the seed sown on the good ground are those who hear the message, and welcome it, and yield a return, thirty, sixty, and even a hundred fold.” </span>
<!-- 004 020 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v041004021" id="004021" >21</span>
 Jesus said to them,  <span class="woc"> “Is a lamp brought to be put under a basket or under the couch, instead of being put on the lamp-stand? </span><span class="verse" rel="v041004022" id="004022" >22</span>
<span class="woc"> There is nothing hidden that will not come to light and nothing is concealed that will not be brought into the open. </span><span class="verse" rel="v041004023" id="004023" >23</span>
<span class="woc"> Let all who have ears to hear with hear. </span>
<!-- 004 023 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v041004024" id="004024" >24</span>
<span class="woc"> “Take care what you listen to,” </span>  said Jesus.  <span class="woc"> “The standard you use will be used for you, and more will be added for you. </span><span class="verse" rel="v041004025" id="004025" >25</span>
<span class="woc"> For, to those who have, more will be given; while, from those who have nothing, even what they have will be taken away.” </span>
<!-- 004 025 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v041004026" id="004026" >26</span>
 Jesus also said,  <span class="woc"> “This is what the kingdom of God is like – like a man who has scattered seed on the ground, </span><span class="verse" rel="v041004027" id="004027" >27</span>
<span class="woc"> and then sleeps by night and rises by day, while the seed is shooting up and growing – he knows not how. </span><span class="verse" rel="v041004028" id="004028" >28</span>
<span class="woc"> The ground bears the crop of itself – first the blade, then the ear, and then the full grain in the ear; </span><span class="verse" rel="v041004029" id="004029" >29</span>
<span class="woc"> but, as soon as the crop is ready, immediately he puts in the sickle because harvest has come.” </span>
<!-- 004 029 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v041004030" id="004030" >30</span>
 Jesus also said,  <span class="woc"> “To what can we liken the kingdom of God? </span><span class="verse" rel="v041004031" id="004031" >31</span>
<span class="woc"> By what can we illustrate it? Perhaps by the growth of a mustard seed. This seed, when sown in the ground, though it is smaller than all other seeds, </span><span class="verse" rel="v041004032" id="004032" >32</span>
<span class="woc"> yet, when sown, shoots up, and becomes larger than any other herb, and puts out great branches, so that even the wild birds can roost in its shelter.” </span>
<!-- 004 032 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v041004033" id="004033" >33</span>
 With many such parables Jesus used to speak to the people of his message, as far as they were able to receive it; <span class="verse" rel="v041004034" id="004034" >34</span>
 and to them he never used to speak except in parables; but in private to his own disciples he explained everything. <p>
<!-- 004 034 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v041004035" id="004035" >35</span>
 In the evening of the same day, Jesus said to them,  <span class="woc"> “Let us go across.” </span><span class="verse" rel="v041004036" id="004036" >36</span>
 So, leaving the crowd behind, they took him with them, just as he was, in the boat; and there were other boats with him. <span class="verse" rel="v041004037" id="004037" >37</span>
 A violent squall came on, and the waves kept dashing into the boat, so that the boat was actually filling. <span class="verse" rel="v041004038" id="004038" >38</span>
 Jesus was in the stern asleep on the cushion; and the disciples roused him and cried, “Teacher! Is it nothing to you that we are lost?” <span class="verse" rel="v041004039" id="004039" >39</span>
 Jesus rose and rebuked the wind, and said to the sea,  <span class="woc"> “Hush! Be still!” </span>  Then the wind dropped, and a great calm followed. <span class="verse" rel="v041004040" id="004040" >40</span>
<span class="woc"> “Why are you so timid?” </span>  he exclaimed.  <span class="woc"> “Have you no faith yet?” </span><span class="verse" rel="v041004041" id="004041" >41</span>
 But they were struck with great awe, and said to one another, “Who can this be that even the wind and the sea obey him?” 
<!-- 005 041 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="005001">5</span> They came to the other side of the sea – the region of the Gerasenes; <span class="verse" rel="v041005002" id="005002" >2</span>
 and, as soon as Jesus had got out of the boat, he met a man coming out of the tombs, who was under the power of a foul spirit, <span class="verse" rel="v041005003" id="005003" >3</span>
 and who made his home in the tombs. No one had ever been able to secure him, even with a chain; <span class="verse" rel="v041005004" id="005004" >4</span>
 for, though he had many times been left secured with fetters and chains, he had snapped the chains and broken the fetters to pieces, and no one could master him. <span class="verse" rel="v041005005" id="005005" >5</span>
 Night and day alike, he was continually shrieking in the tombs and among the hills, and cutting himself with stones. <span class="verse" rel="v041005006" id="005006" >6</span>
 Catching sight of Jesus from a distance, he ran and bowed to the ground before him, <span class="verse" rel="v041005007" id="005007" >7</span>
 shrieking out in a loud voice, “What do you want with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? For God’s sake do not torment me!” <span class="verse" rel="v041005008" id="005008" >8</span>
 For Jesus had said,  <span class="woc"> “Come out from the man, you foul spirit.” </span><span class="verse" rel="v041005009" id="005009" >9</span>
 And he asked him,  <span class="woc"> “What is your name?” </span>  “My name,” he said, “is Legion, for there are many of us;” <span class="verse" rel="v041005010" id="005010" >10</span>
 and he begged Jesus again and again not to send them away out of that country. 
<!-- 005 010 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v041005011" id="005011" >11</span>
 There was a large herd of pigs close by, feeding on the hillside; <span class="verse" rel="v041005012" id="005012" >12</span>
 and the spirits begged Jesus, “Send us into the pigs so that we can take possession of them.” <span class="verse" rel="v041005013" id="005013" >13</span>
 Jesus gave them leave. They came out, and entered into the pigs; and the herd – about two thousand in number – rushed down the steep slope into the sea and were drowned in the sea. 
<!-- 005 013 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v041005014" id="005014" >14</span>
 Then the men who tended them ran away, and carried the news to the town, and to the country around; and the people went to see what had happened. <span class="verse" rel="v041005015" id="005015" >15</span>
 When they came to Jesus, they found the possessed man sitting there, clothed and in his right mind – the man who had had the ‘Legion’ in him – and they were awe-struck. <span class="verse" rel="v041005016" id="005016" >16</span>
 Then those who had seen it related to them all that had happened to the possessed man, as well as about the pigs; <span class="verse" rel="v041005017" id="005017" >17</span>
 so they began to beg Jesus to leave their region. 
<!-- 005 017 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v041005018" id="005018" >18</span>
 As Jesus was getting into the boat, the possessed man begged him to let him stay with him. <span class="verse" rel="v041005019" id="005019" >19</span>
 But Jesus refused.  <span class="woc"> “Go back to your home, to your own people,” </span>  he said,  <span class="woc"> “and tell them of all that the Lord has done for you, and how he took pity on you.” </span><span class="verse" rel="v041005020" id="005020" >20</span>
 So the man went, and began to proclaim in the district of the Ten Towns all that Jesus had done for him; and everyone was amazed. 
<!-- 005 020 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v041005021" id="005021" >21</span>
 By the time Jesus had recrossed in the boat to the opposite shore, a great number of people had gathered to meet him, and were standing by the sea. <span class="verse" rel="v041005022" id="005022" >22</span>
 One of the leaders of the synagogue, whose name was Jairus, came and, as soon as he saw Jesus, threw himself at his feet and begged him repeatedly, <span class="verse" rel="v041005023" id="005023" >23</span>
 saying, “My little daughter is at death’s door. Please come and place your hands on her so that she may recover and live.” <span class="verse" rel="v041005024" id="005024" >24</span>
 So Jesus went with him. A great number of people followed Jesus, and kept pressing around him. 
<!-- 005 024 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v041005025" id="005025" >25</span>
 Meanwhile a woman who for twelve years had suffered from hemorrhage, <span class="verse" rel="v041005026" id="005026" >26</span>
 and undergone much at the hands of many doctors, (spending all she had without obtaining any relief, but, on the contrary, growing worse), <span class="verse" rel="v041005027" id="005027" >27</span>
 heard about Jesus, came behind in the crowd, and touched his cloak. <span class="verse" rel="v041005028" id="005028" >28</span>
 “If I can only touch his clothes,” she said, “I will get well!” <span class="verse" rel="v041005029" id="005029" >29</span>
 At once her bleeding stopped, and she felt in herself that she was cured of her affliction. <span class="verse" rel="v041005030" id="005030" >30</span>
 Jesus at once became aware of the power that had gone out from him, and, turning around in the crowd, he said,  <span class="woc"> “Who touched my clothes?” </span>
<!-- 005 030 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v041005031" id="005031" >31</span>
 “You see the people pressing around you,” exclaimed his disciples, “and yet you say  <span class="woc"> ‘Who touched me?’” </span><span class="verse" rel="v041005032" id="005032" >32</span>
 But Jesus looked about to see who had done it. <span class="verse" rel="v041005033" id="005033" >33</span>
 Then the woman, in fear and trembling, knowing what had happened to her, came and threw herself down before him, and told him the whole truth. <span class="verse" rel="v041005034" id="005034" >34</span>
<span class="woc"> “Daughter,” </span>  he said,  <span class="woc"> “your faith has delivered you. Go, and peace be with you; be free from your affliction.” </span>
<!-- 005 034 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v041005035" id="005035" >35</span>
 Before he had finished speaking, some people from the house of the synagogue leader came and said, “Your daughter is dead! Why should you trouble the teacher further?” <span class="verse" rel="v041005036" id="005036" >36</span>
 But Jesus, overhearing what they were saying, said to the synagogue leader,  <span class="woc"> “Do not be afraid; only have faith.” </span><span class="verse" rel="v041005037" id="005037" >37</span>
 And he allowed no one to accompany him, except Peter, James, and John, the brother of James. <span class="verse" rel="v041005038" id="005038" >38</span>
 Presently they reached the leader’s house, where Jesus saw a scene of confusion – people weeping and wailing incessantly. <span class="verse" rel="v041005039" id="005039" >39</span>
<span class="woc"> “Why this confusion and weeping?” </span>  he said on entering.  <span class="woc"> “The little child is not dead; she is asleep.” </span><span class="verse" rel="v041005040" id="005040" >40</span>
 They began to laugh at him; but he sent them all out, and then, with the child’s father and mother and his companions, went into the room where she was lying. <span class="verse" rel="v041005041" id="005041" >41</span>
 Taking her hand, Jesus said to her,  <span class="woc"> “Talitha, koum!” </span>  – which means  <span class="woc"> ‘little girl, I am speaking to you – Rise!’ </span><span class="verse" rel="v041005042" id="005042" >42</span>
 The little girl stood up at once, and began to walk about; for she was twelve years old. And, as soon as they saw it, they were overwhelmed with amazement; <span class="verse" rel="v041005043" id="005043" >43</span>
 but Jesus repeatedly cautioned them not to let anyone know of it, and told them to give her something to eat. 
<!-- 006 043 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="006001">6</span> On leaving that place, Jesus, followed by his disciples, went to his own part of the country. <span class="verse" rel="v041006002" id="006002" >2</span>
 When the Sabbath came, he began to teach in the synagogue; and the people, as they listened, were deeply impressed. “Where did he get this?” they said, “and what is this wisdom that has been given him? And these miracles which he is doing? <span class="verse" rel="v041006003" id="006003" >3</span>
 Isn’t he the carpenter, the son of Mary, and the brother of James, and Joses, and Judas, and Simon? And aren’t his sisters, too, living here among us?” This proved a hindrance to their believing in him; <span class="verse" rel="v041006004" id="006004" >4</span>
 at which Jesus said,  <span class="woc"> “A prophet is not without honor, except in his home town, and among his own relatives, and in his own home.” </span><span class="verse" rel="v041006005" id="006005" >5</span>
 And he could not work any miracle there, beyond placing his hands on a few infirm persons, and curing them; <span class="verse" rel="v041006006" id="006006" >6</span>
 and he wondered at the want of faith shown by the people. Jesus went around the villages, one after another, teaching. <p>
<!-- 006 006 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v041006007" id="006007" >7</span>
 He called the Twelve to him, and began to send them out as his messengers, two and two, and gave them authority over foul spirits. <span class="verse" rel="v041006008" id="006008" >8</span>
 He instructed them to take nothing but a staff for the journey – not even bread, or a bag, or coins in their purse; <span class="verse" rel="v041006009" id="006009" >9</span>
 but they were to wear sandals, and not to put on a second coat. <span class="verse" rel="v041006010" id="006010" >10</span>
<span class="woc"> “Whenever you go to stay at a house,” </span>  he said,  <span class="woc"> “remain there until you leave that place; </span><span class="verse" rel="v041006011" id="006011" >11</span>
<span class="woc"> and if a place does not welcome you, or listen to you, as you go out of it shake off the dust that is on the soles of your feet, as a protest against them.” </span><span class="verse" rel="v041006012" id="006012" >12</span>
 So they set out, and proclaimed the need of repentance. <span class="verse" rel="v041006013" id="006013" >13</span>
 They drove out many demons, and anointed with oil many who were infirm, and cured them.

<p><span class="verse" rel="v041006014" id="006014" >14</span>
 Now King Herod heard of Jesus; for his name had become well known. People were saying – “John the Baptizer must have risen from the dead, and that is why these miraculous powers are active in him.” <span class="verse" rel="v041006015" id="006015" >15</span>
 Others again said – “He is Elijah,” and others – “He is a prophet, like one of the great prophets.” <span class="verse" rel="v041006016" id="006016" >16</span>
 But when Herod heard of him, he said – “The man whom I beheaded – John – he must be risen!” 
<!-- 006 016 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v041006017" id="006017" >17</span>
 For Herod himself had sent and arrested John, and put him in prison, in chains, to please Herodias, the wife of his brother Philip, because Herod had married her. <span class="verse" rel="v041006018" id="006018" >18</span>
 For John had said to Herod – “You have no right to be living with your brother’s wife.” <span class="verse" rel="v041006019" id="006019" >19</span>
 So Herodias was incensed against John, and wanted to put him to death, but was unable to do so, <span class="verse" rel="v041006020" id="006020" >20</span>
 because Herod stood in fear of John, knowing him to be an upright and holy man, and protected him. He had listened to John, but still remained much perplexed, and yet he found pleasure in listening to him. 
<!-- 006 020 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v041006021" id="006021" >21</span>
 A suitable opportunity, however, occurred when Herod, on his birthday, gave a dinner to his high officials, and his generals, and the foremost men in Galilee. <span class="verse" rel="v041006022" id="006022" >22</span>
 When his daughter – that is, the daughter of Herodias – came in and danced, she delighted Herod and those who were dining with him. “Ask me for whatever you like,” the king said to the girl, “and I will give it to you”; <span class="verse" rel="v041006023" id="006023" >23</span>
 and he swore to her that he would give her whatever she asked him – up to half his kingdom. <span class="verse" rel="v041006024" id="006024" >24</span>
 The girl went out, and said to her mother “What must I ask for?” 
<!-- 006 024 -->


<p>  “The head of John the Baptizer,” answered her mother. <span class="verse" rel="v041006025" id="006025" >25</span>
 So she went in as quickly as possible to the king, and made her request. “I want you,” she said, “to give me at once, on a dish, the head of John the Baptist.” <span class="verse" rel="v041006026" id="006026" >26</span>
 The king was much distressed; yet, because of his oath and of the guests at his table, he did not like to refuse her. <span class="verse" rel="v041006027" id="006027" >27</span>
 He immediately dispatched one of his bodyguard, with orders to bring John’s head. The man went and beheaded John in the prison, <span class="verse" rel="v041006028" id="006028" >28</span>
 and, bringing his head on a dish, gave it to the girl, and the girl gave it to her mother. 
<!-- 006 028 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v041006029" id="006029" >29</span>
 When John’s disciples heard of it, they came and took his body away, and laid it in a tomb. 
<!-- 006 029 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v041006030" id="006030" >30</span>
 When the apostles came back to Jesus, they told him all that they had done and all that they had taught. <span class="verse" rel="v041006031" id="006031" >31</span>
<span class="woc"> “Come by yourselves privately to some lonely spot,” </span>  he said,  <span class="woc"> “and rest for a while” </span>  – for there were so many people coming and going that they had not time even to eat. <span class="verse" rel="v041006032" id="006032" >32</span>
 So they set off privately in their boat for a lonely spot. <span class="verse" rel="v041006033" id="006033" >33</span>
 Many people saw them going, and recognized them, and from all the towns they flocked together to the place on foot, and got there before them. <span class="verse" rel="v041006034" id="006034" >34</span>
 On getting out of the boat, Jesus saw a great crowd, and his heart was moved at the sight of them, because they were like sheep without a shepherd; and he began to teach them many things. <span class="verse" rel="v041006035" id="006035" >35</span>
 When it grew late, his disciples came up to him, and said, “This is a lonely spot, and it is already late. <span class="verse" rel="v041006036" id="006036" >36</span>
 Send the people away, so that they may go to the farms and villages around and buy themselves something to eat.” <span class="verse" rel="v041006037" id="006037" >37</span>
 But Jesus answered,  <span class="woc"> “It is for you to give them something to eat.” </span>  “Are we to go and spend almost a year’s wages on bread,” they asked, “to give them to eat?” 
<!-- 006 037 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v041006038" id="006038" >38</span>
<span class="woc"> “How many loaves have you?” </span>  he asked,  <span class="woc"> “Go, and see.” </span>  When they had found out, they told him, “Five, and two fish.” <span class="verse" rel="v041006039" id="006039" >39</span>
 Jesus directed them to make all the people take their seats on the green grass, in parties; <span class="verse" rel="v041006040" id="006040" >40</span>
 and they sat down in groups – in hundreds, and in fifties. <span class="verse" rel="v041006041" id="006041" >41</span>
 Taking the five loaves and the two fish, Jesus looked up to heaven, and said the blessing; he broke the loaves into pieces, and gave them to his disciples for them to serve out to the people, and he divided the two fish also among them all. <span class="verse" rel="v041006042" id="006042" >42</span>
 Everyone had sufficient to eat; <span class="verse" rel="v041006043" id="006043" >43</span>
 and they picked up enough broken pieces to fill twelve baskets, as well as some of the fish. <span class="verse" rel="v041006044" id="006044" >44</span>
 The people who ate the bread were five thousand in number. 
<!-- 006 044 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v041006045" id="006045" >45</span>
 Immediately afterward Jesus made his disciples get into the boat, and cross over in advance, in the direction of Bethsaida, while he himself was dismissing the crowd. <span class="verse" rel="v041006046" id="006046" >46</span>
 After he had taken leave of the people, he went away up the hill to pray. <span class="verse" rel="v041006047" id="006047" >47</span>
 When evening fell, the boat was out in the middle of the sea, and Jesus on the shore alone. <span class="verse" rel="v041006048" id="006048" >48</span>
 Seeing them laboring at the oars – for the wind was against them – about three hours after midnight Jesus came towards them, walking on the water, intending to join them. <span class="verse" rel="v041006049" id="006049" >49</span>
 But, when they saw him walking on the water, they thought it was a ghost, and cried out; <span class="verse" rel="v041006050" id="006050" >50</span>
 for all of them saw him, and were terrified. But Jesus at once spoke to them.  <span class="woc"> “Courage!” </span>  he said,  <span class="woc"> “it is I; do not be afraid!” </span><span class="verse" rel="v041006051" id="006051" >51</span>
 Then he got into the boat with them, and the wind dropped. The disciples were utterly amazed, <span class="verse" rel="v041006052" id="006052" >52</span>
 for they had not understood about the loaves, their minds being slow to learn. <span class="verse" rel="v041006053" id="006053" >53</span>
 When they had crossed over, they landed at Gennesaret, and moored the boat. <span class="verse" rel="v041006054" id="006054" >54</span>
 But they had no sooner left her than the people, recognizing Jesus, <span class="verse" rel="v041006055" id="006055" >55</span>
 hurried over the whole countryside, and began to carry about on mats those who were ill, wherever they heard he was. <span class="verse" rel="v041006056" id="006056" >56</span>
 So wherever he went – to villages, or towns, or farms – they would lay their sick in the market-places, begging him to let them touch only the tassel of his cloak; and all who touched were made well. <p>
<!-- 007 056 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="007001">7</span> One day the Pharisees and some of the teachers of the Law who had come from Jerusalem gathered around Jesus. <span class="verse" rel="v041007002" id="007002" >2</span>
 They had noticed that some of his disciples ate their food with their hands ‘defiled,’ by which they meant unwashed. <span class="verse" rel="v041007003" id="007003" >3</span>
 (For the Pharisees, and indeed all strict Jews, will not eat without first scrupulously washing their hands, holding in this to the traditions of their ancestors. <span class="verse" rel="v041007004" id="007004" >4</span>
 When they come from market, they will not eat without first sprinkling themselves; and there are many other customs which they have inherited and hold to, such as the ceremonial washing of cups, and jugs, and copper pans). <span class="verse" rel="v041007005" id="007005" >5</span>
 So the Pharisees and the teachers of the Law asked Jesus this question – “How is it that your disciples do not follow the traditions of our ancestors, but eat their food with defiled hands?” <span class="verse" rel="v041007006" id="007006" >6</span>
 His answer was,  <span class="woc"> “It was well said by Isaiah when he prophesied about you hypocrites in the words – ‘This is a people who honor me with their lips, while their hearts are far removed from me; </span><span class="verse" rel="v041007007" id="007007" >7</span>
<span class="woc"> but vainly do they worship me, For they teach but human precepts.’ </span><span class="verse" rel="v041007008" id="007008" >8</span>
<span class="woc"> You neglect God’s commandments and hold to human traditions. </span><span class="verse" rel="v041007009" id="007009" >9</span>
<span class="woc"> Wisely do you set aside God’s commandments,” </span>  he exclaimed,  <span class="woc"> “to keep your own traditions! </span><span class="verse" rel="v041007010" id="007010" >10</span>
<span class="woc"> For while Moses said ‘Honor your father and your mother,’ and ‘Let anyone who abuses their father or mother suffer death,’ </span><span class="verse" rel="v041007011" id="007011" >11</span>
<span class="woc"> you say ‘If a person says to their father or mother “Whatever of mine might have been of service to you is Corban”’ </span>  (which means ‘Set apart for God’) – <span class="verse" rel="v041007012" id="007012" >12</span>
<span class="woc"> why, then you do not allow them to do anything further for their father or mother! </span><span class="verse" rel="v041007013" id="007013" >13</span>
<span class="woc"> In this way you nullify the words of God by your traditions, which you hand down; and you do many similar things.” </span>
<!-- 007 013 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v041007014" id="007014" >14</span>
 Then Jesus called the people to him again, and said,  <span class="woc"> “Listen to me, all of you, and mark my words. </span><span class="verse" rel="v041007015" id="007015" >15</span>
<span class="woc"> There is nothing external to a person, which by going into them can defile them; but the things that come out of a person are the things that defile them.” </span><span class="verse" rel="v041007016" id="007016" >16</span>
<span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">       Some later manuscripts add: Let anyone with ears to hear, listen. </span>
<!-- 007 016 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v041007017" id="007017" >17</span>
 When Jesus went indoors, away from the crowd, his disciples began questioning him about this saying. <span class="verse" rel="v041007018" id="007018" >18</span>
<span class="woc"> “What, do even you understand so little?” </span>  exclaimed Jesus.  <span class="woc"> “Don’t you see that there is nothing external to a person, which by going into a person, can defile them, </span><span class="verse" rel="v041007019" id="007019" >19</span>
<span class="woc"> because it does not pass into his heart, but into his stomach, and is afterward got rid of?” – in saying this Jesus pronounced all food clean. </span><span class="verse" rel="v041007020" id="007020" >20</span>
<span class="woc"> “It is what comes out from a person,” </span>  he added,  <span class="woc"> “that defiles them, </span><span class="verse" rel="v041007021" id="007021" >21</span>
<span class="woc"> for it is from within, out of the hearts of people, that there come evil thoughts – sexual immorality, theft, murder, adultery, </span><span class="verse" rel="v041007022" id="007022" >22</span>
<span class="woc"> greed, wickedness, deceit, indecency, envy, slander, haughtiness, folly; </span><span class="verse" rel="v041007023" id="007023" >23</span>
<span class="woc"> all these wicked things come from within, and do defile a person.” </span>
<!-- 007 023 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v041007024" id="007024" >24</span>
 On leaving that place, Jesus went to the district of Tyre and Sidon. He went into a house, and did not wish anyone to know it, but could not escape notice. <span class="verse" rel="v041007025" id="007025" >25</span>
 For a woman, whose little daughter had a foul spirit in her, heard of him immediately, and came and threw herself at his feet – <span class="verse" rel="v041007026" id="007026" >26</span>
 the woman was a foreigner, from Syrian Phoenicia – and she begged him to drive the demon out of her daughter. <span class="verse" rel="v041007027" id="007027" >27</span>
<span class="woc"> “Let the children be satisfied first,” </span>  answered Jesus.  <span class="woc"> “For it is not fair to take the children’s food, and throw it to dogs.” </span>
<!-- 007 027 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v041007028" id="007028" >28</span>
 “Yes, Master,” she replied. “Even the dogs under the table do feed on the children’s crumbs.” 
<!-- 007 028 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v041007029" id="007029" >29</span>
<span class="woc"> “For saying that,” </span>  he answered,  <span class="woc"> “you may go. The demon has gone out of your daughter.” </span><span class="verse" rel="v041007030" id="007030" >30</span>
 The woman went home, and found the child lying on her bed, and the demon gone. 
<!-- 007 030 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v041007031" id="007031" >31</span>
 On returning from the district of Tyre, Jesus went, by way of Sidon, to the Sea of Galilee, across the district of the Ten Towns. <span class="verse" rel="v041007032" id="007032" >32</span>
 Some people brought to him a man who was deaf and almost dumb, and they begged Jesus to place his hand on him. <span class="verse" rel="v041007033" id="007033" >33</span>
 Jesus took him aside from the crowd quietly, put his fingers into the man’s ears, and touched his tongue with saliva. <span class="verse" rel="v041007034" id="007034" >34</span>
 Then, looking up to heaven, he sighed, and said to the man,  <span class="woc"> “Ephphatha!” </span>  which means  <span class="woc"> ‘Be opened.’ </span><span class="verse" rel="v041007035" id="007035" >35</span>
 The man’s ears were opened, the string of his tongue was freed, and he began to talk plainly. <span class="verse" rel="v041007036" id="007036" >36</span>
 Jesus insisted on their not telling anyone; but the more he insisted, the more perseveringly they made it known, <span class="verse" rel="v041007037" id="007037" >37</span>
 and a profound impression was made on the people. “He has done everything well!” they exclaimed. “He makes even the deaf hear and the dumb speak!” <p>
<!-- 008 037 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="008001">8</span> About that time, when there was again a great crowd of people who had nothing to eat, Jesus called his disciples to him, and said, <span class="verse" rel="v041008002" id="008002" >2</span>
<span class="woc"> “My heart is moved at the sight of all these people, for they have already been with me three days and they have nothing to eat; </span><span class="verse" rel="v041008003" id="008003" >3</span>
<span class="woc"> and if I send them away to their homes hungry, they will break down on the way; and some of them have come a long distance.” </span>
<!-- 008 003 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v041008004" id="008004" >4</span>
 “Where will it be possible,” his disciples answered, “to get sufficient bread for these people in this lonely place?” 
<!-- 008 004 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v041008005" id="008005" >5</span>
<span class="woc"> “How many loaves have you?” </span>  he asked. “Seven,” they answered. <span class="verse" rel="v041008006" id="008006" >6</span>
 Jesus told the crowd to sit down on the ground. Then he took the seven loaves, and, after saying the thanksgiving, broke them, and gave them to his disciples to serve out; and they served them out to the crowd. <span class="verse" rel="v041008007" id="008007" >7</span>
 They had also a few small fish; and, after he had said the blessing, he told the disciples to serve out these as well. <span class="verse" rel="v041008008" id="008008" >8</span>
 The people had sufficient to eat, and they picked up seven baskets full of the broken pieces that were left. <span class="verse" rel="v041008009" id="008009" >9</span>
 There were about four thousand people. Then Jesus dismissed them. <span class="verse" rel="v041008010" id="008010" >10</span>
 Immediately afterward, getting into the boat with his disciples, Jesus went to the district of Dalmanutha. 
<!-- 008 010 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v041008011" id="008011" >11</span>
 Here the Pharisees came out, and began to argue with Jesus, asking him for some sign from the heavens, to test him. <span class="verse" rel="v041008012" id="008012" >12</span>
 Sighing deeply, Jesus said,  <span class="woc"> “Why does this generation ask for a sign? I tell you, no sign will be given it.” </span><span class="verse" rel="v041008013" id="008013" >13</span>
 So he left them to themselves, and, getting into the boat again, went away to the opposite shore. 
<!-- 008 013 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v041008014" id="008014" >14</span>
 Now the disciples had forgotten to take any bread with them, one loaf being all that they had in the boat. <span class="verse" rel="v041008015" id="008015" >15</span>
 So Jesus gave them this warning.  <span class="woc"> “Take care,” </span>  he said,  <span class="woc"> “beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the leaven of Herod.” </span><span class="verse" rel="v041008016" id="008016" >16</span>
 They began talking to one another about their being short of bread; <span class="verse" rel="v041008017" id="008017" >17</span>
 and, noticing this, Jesus said to them,  <span class="woc"> “Why are you talking about your being short of bread? Don’t you yet see or understand? Are your minds still so slow or comprehension? </span><span class="verse" rel="v041008018" id="008018" >18</span>
<span class="woc"> Though you have eyes, do you not see? And though you have ears, do you not hear? Don’t you remember, </span><span class="verse" rel="v041008019" id="008019" >19</span>
<span class="woc"> when I broke up the five loaves for the five thousand, how many baskets of broken pieces you picked up?” </span>
<!-- 008 019 -->


<p>  “Twelve,” they said. <span class="verse" rel="v041008020" id="008020" >20</span>
<span class="woc"> “And when the seven for the four thousand, how many basketfuls of broken pieces did you pick up?” </span>
<!-- 008 020 -->


<p>  “Seven,” they said. <span class="verse" rel="v041008021" id="008021" >21</span>
<span class="woc"> “Don’t you understand now?” </span>  he repeated. 
<!-- 008 021 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v041008022" id="008022" >22</span>
 They came to Bethsaida. There some people brought a blind man to Jesus, and begged him to touch him. <span class="verse" rel="v041008023" id="008023" >23</span>
 Taking the blind man’s hand, Jesus led him to the outskirts of the village, and, when he had put saliva on the man’s eyes, he placed his hands on him, and asked him,  <span class="woc"> “Do you see anything?” </span><span class="verse" rel="v041008024" id="008024" >24</span>
 The man looked up, and said, “I see the people, for, as they walk about, they look to me like trees.” <span class="verse" rel="v041008025" id="008025" >25</span>
 Then Jesus again placed his hands on the man’s eyes; and the man saw clearly, his sight was restored, and he saw everything with perfect distinctness. <span class="verse" rel="v041008026" id="008026" >26</span>
 Jesus sent him to his home, and said,  <span class="woc"> “Do not go even into the village.” </span><p>
<!-- 008 026 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v041008027" id="008027" >27</span>
 Afterward Jesus and his disciples went into the villages around Caesarea Philippi; and on the way he asked his disciples this question –  <span class="woc"> “Who do people say that I am?” </span>
<!-- 008 027 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v041008028" id="008028" >28</span>
 “John the Baptist,” they answered, “but others say Elijah, while others say one of the prophets.” 
<!-- 008 028 -->

<span class="woc"> “But you,” </span>  he asked,  <span class="woc"> “who do you say that I am?” </span>  To this Peter replied, “You are the Christ.” <span class="verse" rel="v041008030" id="008030" >30</span>
 At which Jesus charged them not to say this about him to anyone. <span class="verse" rel="v041008031" id="008031" >31</span>
 Then he began to teach them that the Son of Man must undergo much suffering, and that he must be rejected by the elders, and the chief priests, and the teachers of the Law, and be put to death, and rise again after three days. <span class="verse" rel="v041008032" id="008032" >32</span>
 He said all this quite openly. But Peter took Jesus aside, and began to rebuke him. <span class="verse" rel="v041008033" id="008033" >33</span>
 Jesus, however, turning around and seeing his disciples, rebuked Peter.  <span class="woc"> “Out of my sight, Satan!” </span>  he exclaimed.  <span class="woc"> “For you look at things, not as God does, but as people do.” </span>
<!-- 008 033 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v041008034" id="008034" >34</span>
 Calling the people and his disciples to him, Jesus said,  <span class="woc"> “If anyone wishes to walk in my steps, they must renounce self, take up their cross, and follow me. </span><span class="verse" rel="v041008035" id="008035" >35</span>
<span class="woc"> For whoever wishes to save their life will lose it, and whoever, for my sake and for the sake of the good news, will lose their life will save it. </span><span class="verse" rel="v041008036" id="008036" >36</span>
<span class="woc"> What good is it to a person to gain the whole world and forfeit their life? </span><span class="verse" rel="v041008037" id="008037" >37</span>
<span class="woc"> For what could a person give that is of equal value with their life? </span><span class="verse" rel="v041008038" id="008038" >38</span>
<span class="woc"> Whoever is ashamed of me and of my teaching, in this unfaithful and wicked generation, of them will the Son of Man be ashamed, when he comes in his Father’s glory with the holy angels.” </span>
<!-- 009 038 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="009001">9</span><span class="woc"> “I tell you,” </span>  he added,  <span class="woc"> “that some of those who are standing here will not know death until they have seen the kingdom of God come in power.” </span>
<!-- 009 001 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v041009002" id="009002" >2</span>
 Six days later, Jesus took with him Peter, James, and John, and led them up a high mountain alone by themselves. There his appearance was transformed before their eyes, <span class="verse" rel="v041009003" id="009003" >3</span>
 and his clothes became whiter than any launderer in the whole world could bleach them. <span class="verse" rel="v041009004" id="009004" >4</span>
 And Elijah appeared to them, in company with Moses; and they were talking with Jesus. <span class="verse" rel="v041009005" id="009005" >5</span>
 “Rabbi,” said Peter, interposing, “it is good to be here; let us make three tents, one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.” <span class="verse" rel="v041009006" id="009006" >6</span>
 For he did not know what to say, because they were much afraid. <span class="verse" rel="v041009007" id="009007" >7</span>
 Then a cloud came down and enveloped them; and from the cloud there came a voice – “This is my dearly loved son; listen to him.” <span class="verse" rel="v041009008" id="009008" >8</span>
 And suddenly, on looking around, they saw that there was now no one with them but Jesus alone. 
<!-- 009 008 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v041009009" id="009009" >9</span>
 As they were going down the mountainside, Jesus cautioned them not to relate what they had seen to anyone, until after the Son of Man had risen from the dead. <span class="verse" rel="v041009010" id="009010" >10</span>
 They seized on these words and discussed with one another what this ‘rising from the dead’ meant. <span class="verse" rel="v041009011" id="009011" >11</span>
 “How is it,” they asked Jesus, “that our teachers of the Law say that Elijah has to come first?” 
<!-- 009 011 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v041009012" id="009012" >12</span>
<span class="woc"> “Elijah does indeed come first,” </span>  answered Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “and re-establish everything; and does not scripture speak, with regard to the Son of Man, of his undergoing much suffering and being utterly despised? </span><span class="verse" rel="v041009013" id="009013" >13</span>
<span class="woc"> But I tell you that Elijah has come, and people have treated him just as they pleased, as scripture says of him.” </span>
<!-- 009 013 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v041009014" id="009014" >14</span>
 When they came to the other disciples, they saw a great crowd around them, and some teachers of the Law arguing with them. <span class="verse" rel="v041009015" id="009015" >15</span>
 But, as soon as they saw Jesus, all the people, in great astonishment, ran up and greeted him. <span class="verse" rel="v041009016" id="009016" >16</span>
<span class="woc"> “What are you arguing about with them?” </span>  Jesus asked. <span class="verse" rel="v041009017" id="009017" >17</span>
 “Teacher,” answered a man in the crowd, “I brought my son to see you, as he has a spirit in him that makes him mute; <span class="verse" rel="v041009018" id="009018" >18</span>
 and, wherever it seizes him, it dashes him down; he foams at the mouth and grinds his teeth, and he is pining away. I asked your disciples to drive the spirit out, but they failed.” 
<!-- 009 018 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v041009019" id="009019" >19</span>
<span class="woc"> “Faithless generation!” </span>  exclaimed Jesus.  <span class="woc"> “How long must I be with you? How long must I have patience with you? Bring the boy to me.” </span><span class="verse" rel="v041009020" id="009020" >20</span>
 They brought him to Jesus; but no sooner did the boy see him than the spirit threw him into convulsions; and he fell on the ground, and rolled about, foaming at the mouth. <span class="verse" rel="v041009021" id="009021" >21</span>
<span class="woc"> “How long has he been like this?” </span>  Jesus asked the boy’s father. <span class="verse" rel="v041009022" id="009022" >22</span>
 “From his childhood,” he answered. “It has often thrown him into fire and into water to put an end to his life; but, if you can possibly do anything, take pity on us, and help us!” <span class="verse" rel="v041009023" id="009023" >23</span>
<span class="woc"> “Why say ‘possibly’?” </span>  Jesus replied.  <span class="woc"> “Everything is possible for one who has faith.” </span><span class="verse" rel="v041009024" id="009024" >24</span>
 The boy’s father immediately cried out, “I have faith; help my want of faith!” <span class="verse" rel="v041009025" id="009025" >25</span>
 But, when Jesus saw that a crowd was quickly collecting, he rebuked the foul spirit,  <span class="woc"> “Deaf and dumb spirit, it is I who command you. Come out from him and never enter him again.” </span><span class="verse" rel="v041009026" id="009026" >26</span>
 With a loud cry the spirit threw the boy into repeated convulsions, and then came out from him. The boy looked like a corpse, so that most of them said that he was dead. <span class="verse" rel="v041009027" id="009027" >27</span>
 But Jesus took his hand, and lifted him; and he stood up. 
<!-- 009 027 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v041009028" id="009028" >28</span>
 When Jesus had gone indoors, his disciples asked him privately, “Why couldn’t we drive it out?” 
<!-- 009 028 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v041009029" id="009029" >29</span>
<span class="woc"> “A spirit of this kind,” </span>  he said,  <span class="woc"> “can be driven out only by prayer.” </span><p>
<!-- 009 029 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v041009030" id="009030" >30</span>
 Leaving that place, Jesus and his disciples went on their way through Galilee; but he did not wish anyone to know it, <span class="verse" rel="v041009031" id="009031" >31</span>
 for he was instructing his disciples, and telling them –  <span class="woc"> “The Son of Man is being betrayed into the hands of his fellow men, and they will put him to death, but, when he has been put to death, he will rise again after three days.” </span><span class="verse" rel="v041009032" id="009032" >32</span>
 But the disciples did not understand his meaning and were afraid to question him. 
<!-- 009 032 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v041009033" id="009033" >33</span>
 They came to Capernaum. When Jesus had gone into the house, he asked them,  <span class="woc"> “What were you discussing on the way?” </span><span class="verse" rel="v041009034" id="009034" >34</span>
 But they were silent; for on the way they had been arguing with one another which was the greatest. <span class="verse" rel="v041009035" id="009035" >35</span>
 Sitting down, Jesus called the Twelve and said,  <span class="woc"> “If anyone wishes to be first, he must be last of all, and servant of all.” </span><span class="verse" rel="v041009036" id="009036" >36</span>
 Then Jesus took a little child, and placed it in the middle of them. Taking it in his arms, he said to them, <span class="verse" rel="v041009037" id="009037" >37</span>
<span class="woc"> “Anyone who, for the sake of my name, welcomes even a little child like this is welcoming me, and anyone who welcomes me is welcoming not me, but him who sent me as his messenger.” </span>

<p><span class="verse" rel="v041009038" id="009038" >38</span>
 “Teacher,” said John, “we saw a man driving out demons by using your name, and we tried to prevent him, because he did not follow us.” 
<!-- 009 038 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v041009039" id="009039" >39</span>
<span class="woc"> “None of you must prevent the man,” </span>  answered Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “for no one will use my name in working a miracle, and yet find it easy to speak evil of me. </span><span class="verse" rel="v041009040" id="009040" >40</span>

<h6>The Journey to Jerusalem</h6>
<!-- 010 050 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="010001">10</span> On leaving that place, Jesus went into the district of Judea on the other side of the Jordan. Crowds gathered about him again; and again, as usual, he began teaching them. <span class="verse" rel="v041010002" id="010002" >2</span>
 Presently some Pharisees came up and, to test him, asked, “Has a husband the right to divorce his wife?” 
<!-- 010 002 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v041010003" id="010003" >3</span>
<span class="woc"> “What direction did Moses give you?” </span>  replied Jesus. <span class="verse" rel="v041010004" id="010004" >4</span>
 “Moses,” they said, “permitted a man to draw up in writing a notice of separation and divorce his wife.” 
<!-- 010 004 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v041010005" id="010005" >5</span>
<span class="woc"> “It was owing to the hardness of your hearts,” </span>  said Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “that Moses gave you this direction; </span><span class="verse" rel="v041010006" id="010006" >6</span>
<span class="woc"> but, at the beginning of the Creation, ‘God made them male and female.’ </span><span class="verse" rel="v041010007" id="010007" >7</span>
<span class="woc"> ‘For this reason a man will leave his father and mother, </span><span class="verse" rel="v041010008" id="010008" >8</span>

<span class="woc"> What God himself, then, has yoked together no one must separate.” </span>
<!-- 010 009 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v041010010" id="010010" >10</span>
 When they were indoors, the disciples asked him again about this, <span class="verse" rel="v041010011" id="010011" >11</span>
 and he said,  <span class="woc"> “Anyone who divorces his wife and marries another woman is guilty of adultery against his wife; </span><span class="verse" rel="v041010012" id="010012" >12</span>
<span class="woc"> and, if the woman divorces her husband and marries another man, she is guilty of adultery.” </span>
<!-- 010 012 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v041010013" id="010013" >13</span>
 Some of the people were bringing little children to Jesus, for him to touch them; but the disciples rebuked those who had brought them. <span class="verse" rel="v041010014" id="010014" >14</span>
 When, however, Jesus saw this, he was indignant.  <span class="woc"> “Let the little children come to me,” </span>  he said,  <span class="woc"> “do not hinder them; for it is to the childlike that the kingdom of God belongs. </span><span class="verse" rel="v041010015" id="010015" >15</span>
<span class="woc"> I tell you, unless a person receives the kingdom of God like a child, they will not enter it at all.” </span><span class="verse" rel="v041010016" id="010016" >16</span>
 Then he embraced the children, and, placing his hands on them, gave them his blessing. 
<!-- 010 016 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v041010017" id="010017" >17</span>
 As Jesus was resuming his journey, a man came running up to him, and threw himself on his knees before him. “Good teacher,” he asked, “what must I do to gain eternal life?” 
<!-- 010 017 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v041010018" id="010018" >18</span>
<span class="woc"> “Why do you call me good?” </span>  answered Jesus.  <span class="woc"> “No one is good but God. </span><span class="verse" rel="v041010019" id="010019" >19</span>
<span class="woc"> You know the commandments – ‘Do not kill. Do not commit adultery. Do not steal. Do not say what is false about others. Do not cheat. Honor your father and your mother.’” </span>
<!-- 010 019 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v041010020" id="010020" >20</span>
 “Teacher,” he replied, “I have observed all these from my childhood.” <span class="verse" rel="v041010021" id="010021" >21</span>
 Jesus looked at the man, and his heart went out to him, and he said,  <span class="woc"> “There is still one thing wanting in you; go and sell all that you have, and give to the poor, and you will have wealth in heaven; then come and follow me.” </span><span class="verse" rel="v041010022" id="010022" >22</span>
 But the man’s face clouded at these words, and he went away distressed, for he had great possessions. 
<!-- 010 022 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v041010023" id="010023" >23</span>
 Then Jesus looked around, and said to his disciples,  <span class="woc"> “How hard it will be for people of wealth to enter the kingdom of God!” </span><span class="verse" rel="v041010024" id="010024" >24</span>
 The disciples were amazed at his words. But Jesus said again,  <span class="woc"> “My children, how hard a thing it is to enter the kingdom of God! </span><span class="verse" rel="v041010025" id="010025" >25</span>
<span class="woc"> It is easier for a camel to get through a needle’s eye, than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God.” </span>
<!-- 010 025 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v041010026" id="010026" >26</span>
 “Then who can be saved?” they exclaimed in the greatest astonishment. <span class="verse" rel="v041010027" id="010027" >27</span>
 Jesus looked at them, and answered,  <span class="woc"> “With people it is impossible, but not with God; for everything is possible with God.” </span>
<!-- 010 027 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v041010028" id="010028" >28</span>
 “But we,” began Peter, “we left everything and have followed you.” 
<!-- 010 028 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v041010029" id="010029" >29</span>
<span class="woc"> “I tell you,” </span>  said Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “there is no one who has left house, or brothers, or sisters, or mother, or father, or children, or land, for my sake and for the good news, </span><span class="verse" rel="v041010030" id="010030" >30</span>

<p><span class="verse" rel="v041010032" id="010032" >32</span>
 They were on the road going up to Jerusalem, with Jesus walking in front of them. The disciples were filled with awe, while those who were following behind were overwhelmed with fear. Gathering the Twelve around him once more, Jesus began to tell them what was about to happen to him. <span class="verse" rel="v041010033" id="010033" >33</span>
<span class="woc"> “Listen!” </span>  he said.  <span class="woc"> “We are going up to Jerusalem; and there the Son of Man will be betrayed to the chief priests and the teachers of the Law, and they will condemn him to death, and they will give him up to the Gentiles, </span><span class="verse" rel="v041010034" id="010034" >34</span>

<p><span class="verse" rel="v041010036" id="010036" >36</span>
<span class="woc"> “What do you want me to do for you?” </span>  he asked. <span class="verse" rel="v041010037" id="010037" >37</span>
 “Grant us this,” they answered, “to sit, one on your right, and the other on your left, when you come in glory.” 
<!-- 010 037 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v041010038" id="010038" >38</span>
<span class="woc"> “You do not know what you are asking,” </span>  Jesus said to them.  <span class="woc"> “Can you drink the cup that I am to drink? Or receive the baptism that I am to receive?” </span>
<!-- 010 038 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v041010039" id="010039" >39</span>
 “Yes,” they answered, “we can.” 
<!-- 010 039 -->


<p>   <span class="woc"> “You will indeed drink the cup that I am to drink,” </span>  Jesus said,  <span class="woc"> “and receive the baptism that I am to receive, </span><span class="verse" rel="v041010040" id="010040" >40</span>

<!-- 010 040 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v041010041" id="010041" >41</span>
 On hearing of this, the ten others were at first very indignant about James and John. <span class="verse" rel="v041010042" id="010042" >42</span>
 But Jesus called the ten to him, and said,  <span class="woc"> “Those who are regarded as ruling among the Gentiles lord it over them, as you know, and their great men oppress them. </span><span class="verse" rel="v041010043" id="010043" >43</span>

 They came to Jericho. When Jesus was going out of the town with his disciples and a large crowd, Bartimaeus, the son of Timaeus, a blind beggar, was sitting by the roadside. <span class="verse" rel="v041010047" id="010047" >47</span>
 Hearing that it was Jesus the Nazarene, he began to call out, “Jesus, Son of David, take pity on me.” <span class="verse" rel="v041010048" id="010048" >48</span>
 Many of the people kept telling him to be quiet; but the man continued to call out all the louder, “Son of David, take pity on me.” <span class="verse" rel="v041010049" id="010049" >49</span>
 Then Jesus stopped.  <span class="woc"> “Call him,” </span>  he said. So they called the blind man. “Have courage!” they exclaimed. “Get up; he is calling you.” <span class="verse" rel="v041010050" id="010050" >50</span>
 The man threw off his cloak, sprang up, and came to Jesus. <span class="verse" rel="v041010051" id="010051" >51</span>
<span class="woc"> “What do you want me to do for you?” </span>  said Jesus, addressing him. “Rabboni,” the blind man answered, “I want to recover my sight.” 
<!-- 010 051 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v041010052" id="010052" >52</span>
<span class="woc"> “You may go,” </span>  Jesus said,  <span class="woc"> “Your faith has delivered you.” </span>  Immediately he recovered his sight, and began to follow Jesus along the road. 
<h6>The Last Days</h6>
<!-- 011 052 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="011001">11</span> When they had almost reached Jerusalem, as far as Bethphage and Bethany, near the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent on two of his disciples. <span class="verse" rel="v041011002" id="011002" >2</span>
<span class="woc"> “Go to the village facing you,” </span>  he said,  <span class="woc"> “and, as soon as you get there, you will find a foal tethered, which no one has ever ridden; untie it, and bring it. </span><span class="verse" rel="v041011003" id="011003" >3</span>
<span class="woc"> And, if anyone says to you ‘Why are you doing that?’, say ‘The Master wants it, and will be sure to send it back here at once.’” </span><span class="verse" rel="v041011004" id="011004" >4</span>
 The two disciples went, and, finding a foal tethered outside a door in the street, they untied it. <span class="verse" rel="v041011005" id="011005" >5</span>
 Some of the bystanders said to them, “What are you doing, untying the foal?” <span class="verse" rel="v041011006" id="011006" >6</span>
 And the two disciples answered as Jesus had told them; and they allowed them to go. <span class="verse" rel="v041011007" id="011007" >7</span>
 Then they brought the foal to Jesus, and, when they had laid their cloaks on it, he seated himself on it. <span class="verse" rel="v041011008" id="011008" >8</span>
 Many of the people spread their cloaks on the road, while some strewed boughs which they had cut from the fields; <span class="verse" rel="v041011009" id="011009" >9</span>
 and those who led the way, as well as those who followed, kept shouting, “God save him! Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord! <span class="verse" rel="v041011010" id="011010" >10</span>
 Blessed is the coming kingdom of our father David! God save him from on high!” 
<!-- 011 010 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v041011011" id="011011" >11</span>
 Jesus entered Jerusalem, and went into the Temple Courts; and, after looking around at everything, as it was already late, he went out to Bethany with the Twelve. 
<!-- 011 011 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v041011012" id="011012" >12</span>
 The next day, after they had left Bethany, Jesus became hungry; <span class="verse" rel="v041011013" id="011013" >13</span>
 and, noticing a fig tree at a distance in leaf, he went to it to see if by any chance he could find something on it; but, on coming up to it, he found nothing but leaves, for it was not the season for figs. <span class="verse" rel="v041011014" id="011014" >14</span>
 So, addressing the tree, he exclaimed,  <span class="woc"> “May no one ever again eat of your fruit!” </span>  And his disciples heard what he said. 
<!-- 011 014 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v041011015" id="011015" >15</span>
 They came to Jerusalem. Jesus went into the Temple Courts, and began to drive out those who were buying and selling there. He overturned the tables of the money changers, and the seats of the pigeon-dealers, <span class="verse" rel="v041011016" id="011016" >16</span>
 and would not allow anyone to carry anything across the Temple Courts. <span class="verse" rel="v041011017" id="011017" >17</span>
 Then he began to teach.  <span class="woc"> “Does not scripture say,” </span>  he asked,  <span class="woc"> “‘My house will be called a house of prayer for all the nations’? But you have made it a den of robbers.” </span><span class="verse" rel="v041011018" id="011018" >18</span>
 Now the chief priests and the teachers of the Law heard this and began to look for some way of putting Jesus to death; for they were afraid of him, since all the people were greatly impressed by his teaching. <span class="verse" rel="v041011019" id="011019" >19</span>
 As soon as evening fell, Jesus and his disciples went out of the city. 
<!-- 011 019 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v041011020" id="011020" >20</span>
 As they passed by early in the morning, they noticed that the fig tree was withered up from the roots. <span class="verse" rel="v041011021" id="011021" >21</span>
 Then Peter recalled what had occurred. “Look, Rabbi,” he exclaimed, “the fig tree which you doomed is withered up!” 
<!-- 011 021 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v041011022" id="011022" >22</span>
<span class="woc"> “Have faith in God!” </span>  replied Jesus. <span class="verse" rel="v041011023" id="011023" >23</span>
<span class="woc"> “I tell you that if anyone should say to this hill ‘Be lifted up and hurled into the sea!’, without ever a doubt in his mind, but in the faith that what he says will be done, he would find that it would be. </span><span class="verse" rel="v041011024" id="011024" >24</span>
<span class="woc"> And therefore I say to you ‘Have faith that whatever you ask for in prayer is already granted you, and you will find that it will be.’ </span>
<!-- 011 024 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v041011025" id="011025" >25</span>
<span class="woc"> “And, whenever you stand up to pray, forgive any grievance that you have against anyone, so that your Father who is in heaven also may forgive you your offenses.” </span><span class="verse" rel="v041011026" id="011026" >26</span>
<span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">       Some later manuscripts add: But if you do not forgive, neither will your Father in heaven forgive your offenses. </span><p>
<!-- 011 026 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v041011027" id="011027" >27</span>
 They came to Jerusalem again. While Jesus was walking about in the Temple Courts, the chief priests, the teachers of the Law, and the elders came up to him. <span class="verse" rel="v041011028" id="011028" >28</span>
 “What authority have you to do these things?” they said. “Who gave you the authority to do them?” 
<!-- 011 028 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v041011029" id="011029" >29</span>
<span class="woc"> “I will put one question to you,” </span>  said Jesus.  <span class="woc"> “Answer me that, and then I will tell you what authority I have to act as I do. </span><span class="verse" rel="v041011030" id="011030" >30</span>
<span class="woc"> It is about John’s baptism. Was it of divine or human origin? Answer me that.” </span><span class="verse" rel="v041011031" id="011031" >31</span>
 They began arguing together. “If we say ‘divine,’ he will say ‘Why then didn’t you believe him?’ <span class="verse" rel="v041011032" id="011032" >32</span>
 Yet can we say ‘human’?” They were afraid of the people, for everyone regarded John as undoubtedly a prophet. <span class="verse" rel="v041011033" id="011033" >33</span>
 So their answer to Jesus was – “We do not know.” 
<!-- 011 033 -->


<p>   <span class="woc"> “Then I,” </span>  replied Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “refuse to tell you what authority I have to do these things.” </span>
<!-- 012 033 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="012001">12</span> Jesus began to speak to them in parables,  <span class="woc"> “A man once planted a vineyard, put a fence around it, dug a wine-press, built a tower, and then let it out to tenants and went abroad. </span><span class="verse" rel="v041012002" id="012002" >2</span>
<span class="woc"> At the proper time he sent a servant to the tenants, to receive from them a share of the produce of the grape harvest; </span><span class="verse" rel="v041012003" id="012003" >3</span>
<span class="woc"> but they seized him, and beat him, and sent him away empty-handed. </span><span class="verse" rel="v041012004" id="012004" >4</span>
<span class="woc"> A second time the owner sent a servant to them; this man, too, the tenants struck on the head, and insulted. </span><span class="verse" rel="v041012005" id="012005" >5</span>
<span class="woc"> He sent another, but him they killed; and so with many others – some they beat and some they killed. </span><span class="verse" rel="v041012006" id="012006" >6</span>
<span class="woc"> He had still one son, who was very dear to him; and him he sent to them last of all. ‘They will respect my son,’ he said. </span><span class="verse" rel="v041012007" id="012007" >7</span>
<span class="woc"> But those tenants said to one another ‘Here is the heir! Come, let us kill him, and his inheritance will be ours.’ </span><span class="verse" rel="v041012008" id="012008" >8</span>
<span class="woc"> So they seized him, and killed him, and threw his body outside the vineyard. </span><span class="verse" rel="v041012009" id="012009" >9</span>
<span class="woc"> What will the owner of the vineyard do? He will come and put the tenants to death, and he will let the vineyard to others. </span>
<!-- 012 009 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v041012010" id="012010" >10</span>
<span class="woc"> “Have you never read this passage of scripture? – ‘The stone which the builders despised has now itself become the cornerstone; </span><span class="verse" rel="v041012011" id="012011" >11</span>
<span class="woc"> this cornerstone has come from the Lord, and is marvelous in our eyes.’” </span>
<!-- 012 011 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v041012012" id="012012" >12</span>
 After this his enemies were eager to arrest him, but they were afraid of the crowd; for they saw that it was at them that he had aimed the parable. So they left him alone, and went away. <p>
<!-- 012 012 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v041012013" id="012013" >13</span>
 Afterward they sent to Jesus some of the Pharisees and Herodians, to set a trap for him in the course of conversation. <span class="verse" rel="v041012014" id="012014" >14</span>
 These men came to him and said, “Teacher, we know that you are an honest man, and are not afraid of anyone, for you pay no regard to a person’s position, but teach the way of God honestly; are we right in paying taxes to the Emperor, or not? <span class="verse" rel="v041012015" id="012015" >15</span>
 Should we pay, or should we not pay?” Knowing their hypocrisy, Jesus said to them,  <span class="woc"> “Why are you testing me? Bring me a coin to look at.” </span><span class="verse" rel="v041012016" id="012016" >16</span>
 And, when they had brought it, he asked,  <span class="woc"> “Whose head and title are these?” </span>
<!-- 012 016 -->


<p>  “The Emperor’s,” they said; <span class="verse" rel="v041012017" id="012017" >17</span>
 and Jesus replied,  <span class="woc"> “Pay to the Emperor what belongs to the Emperor, and to God what belongs to God.” </span>  And they were amazed at him. 
<!-- 012 017 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v041012018" id="012018" >18</span>
 Next came some Sadducees – the men who maintain that there is no resurrection. Their question was this – <span class="verse" rel="v041012019" id="012019" >19</span>
 “Teacher, in our scriptures Moses decreed that, should a man’s brother die, leaving a widow but no child, the man should take the widow as his wife, and raise up a family for his brother. <span class="verse" rel="v041012020" id="012020" >20</span>
 There were once seven brothers. The eldest married, but died and left no family; <span class="verse" rel="v041012021" id="012021" >21</span>
 and the second married his widow, and died without family; and so did the third. <span class="verse" rel="v041012022" id="012022" >22</span>
 All the seven died and left no family. The woman herself died last of all. <span class="verse" rel="v041012023" id="012023" >23</span>
 At the resurrection whose wife will she be, all seven brothers having had her as their wife?” 
<!-- 012 023 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v041012024" id="012024" >24</span>
<span class="woc"> “Is not the reason of your mistake,” </span>  answered Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “your ignorance of the scriptures and of the power of God? </span><span class="verse" rel="v041012025" id="012025" >25</span>
<span class="woc"> When people rise from the dead, there is no marrying or being married; but they are as angels in heaven. </span>
<!-- 012 025 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v041012026" id="012026" >26</span>
<span class="woc"> “As to the dead, and the fact that they rise, have you never read in the book of Moses, in the passage about the Bush, how God spoke to him saying – ‘I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob’? </span><span class="verse" rel="v041012027" id="012027" >27</span>
<span class="woc"> He is not God of dead people, but of living. You are greatly mistaken.” </span>
<!-- 012 027 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v041012028" id="012028" >28</span>
 Then came up one of the teachers of the Law who had heard their discussions. Knowing that Jesus had answered them wisely, he asked him this question, “Which commandment is the most important of all?” 
<!-- 012 028 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v041012029" id="012029" >29</span>
<span class="woc"> “The most important,” </span>  answered Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “is – ‘Hear, Israel; the Lord our God is the one Lord; </span><span class="verse" rel="v041012030" id="012030" >30</span>
<span class="woc"> and you must love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind, and with all your strength.’ </span><span class="verse" rel="v041012031" id="012031" >31</span>
<span class="woc"> The second is this – ‘You must love your neighbor as you love yourself.’ There is no commandment greater than these.” </span>
<!-- 012 031 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v041012032" id="012032" >32</span>
 “Wisely answered, teacher!” exclaimed the teacher of the Law. “It is true, as you say, that there is one God, and that there is no other besides him; <span class="verse" rel="v041012033" id="012033" >33</span>
 and to love him with all one’s heart, and with all one’s understanding, and with all one’s strength, and to love one’s neighbor as one loves oneself is far beyond all burnt offerings and sacrifices.” <span class="verse" rel="v041012034" id="012034" >34</span>
 Seeing that he had answered with discernment, Jesus said to him,  <span class="woc"> “You are not far from the kingdom of God.” </span>
<!-- 012 034 -->


<p>  After that no one ventured to question him further. 
<!-- 012 034 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v041012035" id="012035" >35</span>
 While Jesus was teaching in the Temple Courts, he asked,  <span class="woc"> “How is it that the teachers of the Law say that the Christ is to be David’s son? </span><span class="verse" rel="v041012036" id="012036" >36</span>
<span class="woc"> David said himself, speaking under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit – ‘The Lord said to my lord: Sit at my right hand, until I put your enemies beneath your feet.’ </span><span class="verse" rel="v041012037" id="012037" >37</span>
<span class="woc"> David himself calls him ‘lord,’ how comes it, then, that he is to be his son?” </span>
<!-- 012 037 -->


<p>  The mass of the people listened to Jesus with delight. <span class="verse" rel="v041012038" id="012038" >38</span>
 In the course of his teaching, Jesus said,  <span class="woc"> “See that you are on your guard against the teachers of the Law, who delight to walk about in long robes, and to be greeted in the streets with respect, </span><span class="verse" rel="v041012039" id="012039" >39</span>
<span class="woc"> and to have the best seats in the synagogues, and places of honor at dinner. </span><span class="verse" rel="v041012040" id="012040" >40</span>
<span class="woc"> They are the men who rob widows of their homes, and make a pretense of saying long prayers. Their sentence will be all the heavier.” </span>
<!-- 012 040 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v041012041" id="012041" >41</span>
 Then Jesus sat down opposite the chests for the Temple offerings, and watched how the people put money into them. Many rich people were putting in large sums; <span class="verse" rel="v041012042" id="012042" >42</span>
 but one poor widow came and put in two small coins, worth very little. <span class="verse" rel="v041012043" id="012043" >43</span>
 Then, calling his disciples to him, Jesus said,  <span class="woc"> “I tell you that this poor widow has put in more than all the others who were putting money into the chests; </span><span class="verse" rel="v041012044" id="012044" >44</span>
<span class="woc"> for everyone else put in something from what he had to spare, while she, in her need, put in all she had – everything that she had to live on.” </span><p>
<!-- 013 044 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="013001">13</span> As Jesus was walking out of the Temple Courts, one of his disciples said to him, “Teacher, look what fine stones and buildings these are!” 
<!-- 013 001 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v041013002" id="013002" >2</span>
<span class="woc"> “Do you see these great buildings?” </span>  asked Jesus.  <span class="woc"> “Not a single stone will be left here on another, which will not be thrown down.” </span>
<!-- 013 002 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v041013003" id="013003" >3</span>
 When Jesus had sat down on the Mount of Olives, facing the Temple, Peter, James, John and Andrew questioned him privately, <span class="verse" rel="v041013004" id="013004" >4</span>
 “Tell us when this will be, and what will be the sign when all this is drawing to its close.” 
<!-- 013 004 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v041013005" id="013005" >5</span>
 Then Jesus began,  <span class="woc"> “See that no one leads you astray. </span><span class="verse" rel="v041013006" id="013006" >6</span>
<span class="woc"> Many will take my name, and come saying ‘I am He’, and will lead many astray. </span>

<span class="woc"> “And, when you hear of wars and rumors of wars, do not be alarmed; such things must occur; but the end is not yet. </span><span class="verse" rel="v041013008" id="013008" >8</span>
<span class="woc"> For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; there will be earthquakes in various places; there will be famines. This will be but the beginning of the birth-pangs. </span>

<span class="woc"> “See to yourselves!

<p><span class="chapter" id="014001">14</span> It was now two days before the Festival of the Passover and the unleavened bread. The chief priests and the teachers of the Law were looking for an opportunity to arrest Jesus by stealth, and to put him to death; <span class="verse" rel="v041014002" id="014002" >2</span>
 for they said, “Not during the Festival, or the people may riot.” 
<!-- 014 002 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v041014003" id="014003" >3</span>
 When Jesus was still at Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper, while he was sitting at the table, a woman came with an alabaster jar of choice spikenard perfume of great value. She broke the jar, and poured the perfume on his head. <span class="verse" rel="v041014004" id="014004" >4</span>
 Some of those who were present said to one another indignantly, “Why has the perfume been wasted like this? <span class="verse" rel="v041014005" id="014005" >5</span>
 This perfume could have been sold for more than a year’s wages, and the money given to the poor.” 
<!-- 014 005 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v041014006" id="014006" >6</span>
<span class="woc"> “Leave her alone,” </span>  said Jesus, as they began to find fault with her,  <span class="woc"> “why are you troubling her? This is a beautiful deed that she has done for me. </span><span class="verse" rel="v041014007" id="014007" >7</span>

<span class="woc"> And I tell you, wherever, in the whole world, the good news is proclaimed, what this woman has done will be told in memory of her.” </span>
<!-- 014 009 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v041014010" id="014010" >10</span>
 After this, Judas Iscariot, one of the Twelve, went to the chief priests, to betray Jesus to them. <span class="verse" rel="v041014011" id="014011" >11</span>
 They were glad to hear what he said, and promised to pay him. So he began looking for a good opportunity to betray Jesus. <p>
<!-- 014 011 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v041014012" id="014012" >12</span>
 On the first day of the Festival of the unleavened bread, when it was customary to kill the Passover lambs, his disciples said to Jesus, “Where do you wish us to go and make preparations for your eating the Passover?” <span class="verse" rel="v041014013" id="014013" >13</span>
 Jesus sent forward two of his disciples and said to them,  <span class="woc"> “Go into the city, and there a man carrying a pitcher of water will meet you; follow him; </span><span class="verse" rel="v041014014" id="014014" >14</span>
<span class="woc"> and, wherever he goes in, say to the owner of the house ‘The teacher says – Where is my room where I am to eat the Passover with my disciples?’ </span><span class="verse" rel="v041014015" id="014015" >15</span>
<span class="woc"> He will himself show you a large upstairs room, set out ready; and there make preparations for us.” </span><span class="verse" rel="v041014016" id="014016" >16</span>
 So the disciples set out and went into the city, and found everything just as Jesus had told them; and they prepared the Passover. 
<!-- 014 016 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v041014017" id="014017" >17</span>
 In the evening he went there with the Twelve, <span class="verse" rel="v041014018" id="014018" >18</span>
 and when they had taken their places and were eating, Jesus said,  <span class="woc"> “I tell you that one of you is going to betray me – one who is eating with me.” </span><span class="verse" rel="v041014019" id="014019" >19</span>
 They were grieved at this, and began to say to him, one after another, “Can it be I?” 
<!-- 014 019 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v041014020" id="014020" >20</span>
<span class="woc"> “It is one of you Twelve,” </span>  said Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “the one who is dipping his bread beside me into the dish. </span><span class="verse" rel="v041014021" id="014021" >21</span>
<span class="woc"> True, the Son of Man must go, as scripture says of him, yet alas for that man by whom the Son of Man is being betrayed! For that man it would be better never to have been born!” </span>
<!-- 014 021 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v041014022" id="014022" >22</span>
 While they were eating, Jesus took some bread, and, after saying the blessing, broke it, and gave it to them, and said,  <span class="woc"> “Take it; this is my body.” </span><span class="verse" rel="v041014023" id="014023" >23</span>
 Then he took a cup, and, after saying the thanksgiving, gave it to them, and they all drank from it. <span class="verse" rel="v041014024" id="014024" >24</span>
<span class="woc"> “This is my covenant-blood,” </span>  he said,  <span class="woc"> “which is poured out on behalf of many. </span><span class="verse" rel="v041014025" id="014025" >25</span>
<span class="woc"> I tell you that I will never again drink of the fruit of the vine, until that day when I will drink it new in the kingdom of God.” </span>
<!-- 014 025 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v041014026" id="014026" >26</span>
 They then sang a hymn, and went out up the Mount of Olives, <span class="verse" rel="v041014027" id="014027" >27</span>
 presently Jesus said to them,  <span class="woc"> “All of you will fall away; for scripture says – ‘I will strike down the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.’ </span><span class="verse" rel="v041014028" id="014028" >28</span>
<span class="woc"> Yet, after I have risen, I will go before you into Galilee.” </span>
<!-- 014 028 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v041014029" id="014029" >29</span>
 “Even if everyone else falls away,” said Peter, “I will not.” 
<!-- 014 029 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v041014030" id="014030" >30</span>
<span class="woc"> “I tell you,” </span>  answered Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “that you yourself today – yes, this very night – before the cock crows twice, will disown me three times.” </span><span class="verse" rel="v041014031" id="014031" >31</span>
 But Peter vehemently protested, “Even if I must die with you, I will never disown you!” And they all said the same. <p>
<!-- 014 031 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v041014032" id="014032" >32</span>
 Presently they came to a garden known as Gethsemane, and Jesus said to his disciples  <span class="woc"> “Sit down here while I pray.” </span><span class="verse" rel="v041014033" id="014033" >33</span>
 He took with him Peter, James, and John; and began to show signs of great dismay and deep distress of mind. <span class="verse" rel="v041014034" id="014034" >34</span>
<span class="woc"> “I am sad at heart,” </span>  he said,  <span class="woc"> “sad even to death; wait here, and watch.” </span><span class="verse" rel="v041014035" id="014035" >35</span>
 Going on a little further, he threw himself on the ground, and began to pray that, if it were possible, he might be spared that hour. <span class="verse" rel="v041014036" id="014036" >36</span>
<span class="woc"> “Abba, Father,” </span>  he said,  <span class="woc"> “all things are possible to you; take away this cup from me; yet, not what I will, but what you will.” </span>
<!-- 014 036 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v041014037" id="014037" >37</span>
 Then he came and found the three apostles asleep.  <span class="woc"> “Simon,” </span>  he said to Peter,  <span class="woc"> “are you asleep? Couldn’t you watch for one hour? </span><span class="verse" rel="v041014038" id="014038" >38</span>
<span class="woc"> Watch and pray,” he said to them all, “so that you may not fall into temptation. True, the spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.” </span><span class="verse" rel="v041014039" id="014039" >39</span>
 Again he went away, and prayed in the same words; <span class="verse" rel="v041014040" id="014040" >40</span>
 and coming back again he found them asleep, for their eyes were heavy; and they did not know what to say to him. 
<!-- 014 040 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v041014041" id="014041" >41</span>
 A third time he came, and said to them,  <span class="woc"> “Sleep on now, and rest yourselves. Enough! My time has come. Look, the Son of Man is being betrayed into the hands of wicked people. </span><span class="verse" rel="v041014042" id="014042" >42</span>
<span class="woc"> Up, and let us be going. Look! My betrayer is close at hand.” </span>
<!-- 014 042 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v041014043" id="014043" >43</span>
 And just then, while he was still speaking, Judas, who was one of the Twelve, came up; and with him a crowd of people, with swords and clubs, sent by the chief priests, the teachers of the Law, and the elders. <span class="verse" rel="v041014044" id="014044" >44</span>
 Now the betrayer had arranged a signal with them. “The man whom I kiss,” he had said, “will be the one; arrest him and take him away safely.” <span class="verse" rel="v041014045" id="014045" >45</span>
 As soon as Judas came, he went up to Jesus at once, and said, “Rabbi!” and kissed him. <span class="verse" rel="v041014046" id="014046" >46</span>
 Then the men seized Jesus, and arrested him. 
<!-- 014 046 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v041014047" id="014047" >47</span>
 One of those who were standing by drew his sword, and struck at the high priest’s servant, and cut off his ear. <span class="verse" rel="v041014048" id="014048" >48</span>
 But Jesus spoke up, and said to the men,  <span class="woc"> “Have you come out, as if after a robber, with swords and clubs, to take me? </span><span class="verse" rel="v041014049" id="014049" >49</span>
<span class="woc"> I have been among you day after day in the Temple Courts teaching, and yet you did not arrest me; but this is in fulfillment of the scriptures.” </span><span class="verse" rel="v041014050" id="014050" >50</span>
 And all the apostles deserted him and fled. <span class="verse" rel="v041014051" id="014051" >51</span>
 One young man did indeed follow him, wrapped only in a linen sheet. They tried to arrest him; <span class="verse" rel="v041014052" id="014052" >52</span>
 but he left the sheet in their hands, and fled naked. <p>
<!-- 014 052 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v041014053" id="014053" >53</span>
 Then they took Jesus to the high priest; and all the chief priests, elders, and the teachers of the Law assembled. <span class="verse" rel="v041014054" id="014054" >54</span>
 Peter, who had followed Jesus at a distance into the courtyard of the high priest, was sitting there among the guards, warming himself at the blaze of the fire. 
<!-- 014 054 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v041014055" id="014055" >55</span>
 Meanwhile the chief priest and the whole of the High Council were trying to get such evidence against Jesus as would warrant his being put to death, but they could not find any; <span class="verse" rel="v041014056" id="014056" >56</span>
 for, though there were many who gave false evidence against him, yet their evidence did not agree. <span class="verse" rel="v041014057" id="014057" >57</span>
 Presently some men stood up, and gave this false evidence against him – <span class="verse" rel="v041014058" id="014058" >58</span>
 “We ourselves heard him say ‘I will destroy this Temple made with hands, and in three days build another made without hands.’” <span class="verse" rel="v041014059" id="014059" >59</span>
 Yet not even on that point did their evidence agree. 
<!-- 014 059 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v041014060" id="014060" >60</span>
 Then the high priest stood forward, and questioned Jesus. “Have you no answer to make?” he asked. “What is this evidence which these men are giving against you?” <span class="verse" rel="v041014061" id="014061" >61</span>
 But Jesus remained silent, and made no answer. 
<!-- 014 061 -->


<p>  A second time the high priest questioned him. “Are you,” he asked, “the Christ, the Son of the Blessed One?” 
<!-- 014 061 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v041014062" id="014062" >62</span>
<span class="woc"> “I am,” </span>  replied Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “and you will all see the Son of Man sitting on the right hand of the Almighty, and coming in the clouds of heaven.” </span><span class="verse" rel="v041014063" id="014063" >63</span>
 At this the high priest tore his vestments. “Why do we want any more witnesses?” he exclaimed. <span class="verse" rel="v041014064" id="014064" >64</span>
 “You heard his blasphemy? What is your verdict?” They all condemned him, declaring that he deserved death. 
<!-- 014 064 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v041014065" id="014065" >65</span>
 Some of those present began to spit at him, and to blindfold his eyes, and strike him, saying, as they did so, “Now play the prophet!” and even the guards received him with blows. 
<!-- 014 065 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v041014066" id="014066" >66</span>
 While Peter was in the courtyard down below, one of the high priest’s maidservants came up; <span class="verse" rel="v041014067" id="014067" >67</span>
 and, seeing Peter warming himself, she looked closely at him, and exclaimed, “Why, you were with Jesus, the Nazarene!” <span class="verse" rel="v041014068" id="014068" >68</span>
 But Peter denied it. “I do not know or understand what you mean,” he replied. Then he went out into the porch; <span class="verse" rel="v041014069" id="014069" >69</span>
 and there the maidservant, on seeing him, began to say again to the bystanders, “This is one of them!” <span class="verse" rel="v041014070" id="014070" >70</span>
 But Peter again denied it. 
<!-- 014 070 -->


<p>  Soon afterward the bystanders again said to him, “You certainly are one of them; why you are a Galilean!” <span class="verse" rel="v041014071" id="014071" >71</span>
 But he said to them, “I swear that I do not know the man you are talking about! May God punish me if I am lying!” <span class="verse" rel="v041014072" id="014072" >72</span>
 At that moment, for the second time, a cock crowed; and Peter remembered the words that Jesus had said to him –  <span class="woc"> ‘Before a cock has crowed twice, you will disown me three times’; </span>  and, as he thought of it, he began to weep. <p>
<!-- 015 072 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="015001">15</span> As soon as it was daylight, the chief priests, after holding a consultation with elders and teachers of the Law – that is to say, the whole High Council – put Jesus in chains, and took him away, and gave him up to Pilate. <span class="verse" rel="v041015002" id="015002" >2</span>
 “Are you the king of the Jews?” asked Pilate.  <span class="woc"> “It is true,” </span>  replied Jesus. <span class="verse" rel="v041015003" id="015003" >3</span>
 Then the chief priests brought a number of charges against him. <span class="verse" rel="v041015004" id="015004" >4</span>
 So Pilate questioned Jesus again. “Have you no reply to make?” he asked. “Listen, how many charges they are bringing against you.” <span class="verse" rel="v041015005" id="015005" >5</span>
 But Jesus still made no reply whatever; at which Pilate was astonished. 
<!-- 015 005 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v041015006" id="015006" >6</span>
 Now, at the feast, Pilate used to grant the people the release of any one prisoner whom they might ask for. <span class="verse" rel="v041015007" id="015007" >7</span>
 A man called Barabbas was in prison, with the rioters who had committed murder during a riot. <span class="verse" rel="v041015008" id="015008" >8</span>
 So, when the crowd went up and began to ask Pilate to follow his usual custom, <span class="verse" rel="v041015009" id="015009" >9</span>
 he answered, “Do you want me to release the ‘king of the Jews’ for you?” <span class="verse" rel="v041015010" id="015010" >10</span>
 For he was aware that it was out of jealousy that the chief priests had given Jesus up to him. <span class="verse" rel="v041015011" id="015011" >11</span>
 But the chief priests incited the crowd to get Barabbas released instead. <span class="verse" rel="v041015012" id="015012" >12</span>
 Pilate, however, spoke to them again, “What should I do then with the man whom you call the ‘king of the Jews’?” <span class="verse" rel="v041015013" id="015013" >13</span>
 Again they shouted, “Crucify him!” 
<!-- 015 013 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v041015014" id="015014" >14</span>
 “Why, what harm has he done?” Pilate kept saying to them. But they shouted furiously, “Crucify him!” <span class="verse" rel="v041015015" id="015015" >15</span>
 And Pilate, wishing to satisfy the crowd, released Barabbas to them, and, after scourging Jesus, gave him up to be crucified. 
<!-- 015 015 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v041015016" id="015016" >16</span>
 The soldiers then took Jesus away into the courtyard – that is the Government house – and they called the whole garrison together. <span class="verse" rel="v041015017" id="015017" >17</span>
 They dressed him in a purple robe, and, having twisted a crown of thorns, put it on him, <span class="verse" rel="v041015018" id="015018" >18</span>
 and then began to salute him. “Long life to you, king of the Jews!” they said. <span class="verse" rel="v041015019" id="015019" >19</span>
 And they kept striking him on the head with a rod, spitting at him, and bowing to the ground before him – going down on their knees; <span class="verse" rel="v041015020" id="015020" >20</span>
 and, when they had left off mocking him, they took off the purple robe, and put his own clothes on him. <p>
<!-- 015 020 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v041015021" id="015021" >21</span>
 They led Jesus out to crucify him; and they compelled a passer-by, Simon from Cyrene, who was on his way in from the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to go with them to carry his cross. 
<!-- 015 021 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v041015022" id="015022" >22</span>
 They brought Jesus to the place which was known as Golgotha – a name which means ‘place of a Skull.’ <span class="verse" rel="v041015023" id="015023" >23</span>
 There they offered him drugged wine; but Jesus refused it. <span class="verse" rel="v041015024" id="015024" >24</span>
 Then they crucified him, and divided his clothes among them, casting lots for them, to settle what each should take.

 It was nine in the morning when they crucified him. <span class="verse" rel="v041015026" id="015026" >26</span>
 The words of the charge against him, written up over his head, read – ‘THE KING OF THE JEWS.’ <span class="verse" rel="v041015027" id="015027" >27</span>
 And with him they crucified two robbers, one on the right, and the other on the left. <span class="verse" rel="v041015028" id="015028" >28</span>
<span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">       Some later manuscripts add: And the scripture was fulfilled that says, ‘He was counted among outlaws.’ </span>

 The passers-by railed at him, shaking their heads, as they said, “Ah! You who would destroy the Temple and build one in three days, <span class="verse" rel="v041015030" id="015030" >30</span>
 come down from the cross and save yourself!” <span class="verse" rel="v041015031" id="015031" >31</span>
 In the same way the chief priests, with the teachers of the Law, said to one another in mockery, <span class="verse" rel="v041015032" id="015032" >32</span>
 “He saved others, but he cannot save himself! Let the Christ, the ‘king of Israel,’ come down from the cross now so that we can see it and believe.” Even the men who had been crucified with Jesus insulted him.

 At midday, a darkness came over the whole country, lasting until three in the afternoon. <span class="verse" rel="v041015034" id="015034" >34</span>
 And, at three, Jesus called out loudly,  <span class="woc"> “Eloi, Eloi, lama sabacthani?” </span>  which means  <span class="woc"> ‘My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?’ </span><span class="verse" rel="v041015035" id="015035" >35</span>
 Some of those standing around heard this, and said, “Listen! He is calling for Elijah!” <span class="verse" rel="v041015036" id="015036" >36</span>
 And a man ran, and, soaking a sponge in common wine, put it on the end of a rod, and offered it to him to drink, saying as he did so, “Wait and let us see if Elijah is coming to take him down.” <span class="verse" rel="v041015037" id="015037" >37</span>
 But Jesus, giving a loud cry, breathed his last. <span class="verse" rel="v041015038" id="015038" >38</span>
 The Temple curtain was torn in two from top to bottom. <span class="verse" rel="v041015039" id="015039" >39</span>
 The Roman officer, who was standing facing Jesus, on seeing the way in which he breathed his last, exclaimed, “This man must indeed have been God’s son!” <p>

 There were some women also watching from a distance, among them being Mary of Magdala, Mary the mother of James the Little and of Joseph, and Salome – <span class="verse" rel="v041015041" id="015041" >41</span>
 all of whom used to accompany Jesus when he was in Galilee, and give him support – besides many other women who had come up with him to Jerusalem.

 The evening had already fallen, when, as it was the Preparation day – the day before the Sabbath – <span class="verse" rel="v041015043" id="015043" >43</span>
 Joseph from Arimathea, a councillor of good position, who was himself living in expectation of the kingdom of God, came and ventured to go in to see Pilate, and to ask for the body of Jesus. <span class="verse" rel="v041015044" id="015044" >44</span>
 But Pilate was surprised to hear that he had already died. So he sent for the officer, and asked if he were already dead; <span class="verse" rel="v041015045" id="015045" >45</span>
 and, on learning from the officer that it was so, he gave the corpse to Joseph. <span class="verse" rel="v041015046" id="015046" >46</span>
 Joseph, having bought a linen sheet, took Jesus down, and wound the sheet around him, and laid him in a tomb which had been cut out of the rock; and then rolled a stone up against the entrance of the tomb. <span class="verse" rel="v041015047" id="015047" >47</span>
 Mary of Magdala and Mary, the mother of Joseph, were watching to see where he was laid.

<p><span class="chapter" id="016001">16</span> When the Sabbath was over, Mary of Magdala, Mary the mother of James, and Salome bought some spices, so that they might go and anoint the body of Jesus. <span class="verse" rel="v041016002" id="016002" >2</span>
 Very early on the first day of the week they went to the tomb, after sunrise. <span class="verse" rel="v041016003" id="016003" >3</span>
 They were saying to one another, “Who will roll away the stone for us from the entrance of the tomb?” <span class="verse" rel="v041016004" id="016004" >4</span>
 But, on looking up, they saw that the stone had already been rolled back; it was a very large one. <span class="verse" rel="v041016005" id="016005" >5</span>
 Going into the tomb, they saw a young man sitting on their right, in a white robe, and they were dismayed; but he said to them, <span class="verse" rel="v041016006" id="016006" >6</span>
 “Do not be dismayed; you are looking for Jesus, the Nazarene, who has been crucified; he has risen, he is not here! Look! Here is the place where they laid him. <span class="verse" rel="v041016007" id="016007" >7</span>
 But go, and say to his disciples and to Peter ‘He is going before you into Galilee; there you will see him, as he told you.’” <span class="verse" rel="v041016008" id="016008" >8</span>
 They went out, and fled from the tomb, for they were trembling and bewildered; and they did not say a word to anyone, for they were frightened.

 After his rising again, early on the first day of the week, Jesus appeared first of all to Mary of Magdala, from whom he had driven out seven demons. <span class="verse" rel="v041016010" id="016010" >10</span>
 She went and told the news to those who had been with him and who were now in sorrow and tears; <span class="verse" rel="v041016011" id="016011" >11</span>
 yet even they, when they heard that he was alive and had been seen by her, did not believe it. <span class="verse" rel="v041016012" id="016012" >12</span>
 Afterward, altered in appearance, he made himself known to two of them, as they were walking, on their way into the country. <span class="verse" rel="v041016013" id="016013" >13</span>
 They also went and told the rest, but they did not believe even them. <span class="verse" rel="v041016014" id="016014" >14</span>
 Later on, he made himself known to the Eleven themselves as they were at a meal, and reproached them with their want of faith and their stubbornness, because they did not believe those who had seen him after he had risen from the dead. <span class="verse" rel="v041016015" id="016015" >15</span>
 Then he said to them,  <span class="woc"> “Go into all the world, and proclaim the good news to all creation. </span><span class="verse" rel="v041016016" id="016016" >16</span>
<span class="woc"> He who believes and is baptized will be saved; but he who refuses to believe will be condemned. </span><span class="verse" rel="v041016017" id="016017" >17</span>
<span class="woc"> Moreover these signs will attend those who believe. In my name they will drive out demons; they will speak in new languages; </span><span class="verse" rel="v041016018" id="016018" >18</span>
<span class="woc"> they will take up snakes in their hands; and, if they drink any poison, it will not hurt them; they will place their hands on sick people and they will recover.” </span><span class="verse" rel="v041016019" id="016019" >19</span>
 So the Lord Jesus, after he had spoken to them, was taken up into heaven, and sat at the right hand of God. <span class="verse" rel="v041016020" id="016020" >20</span>
 But they set out, and made the proclamation everywhere, the Lord working with them, and confirming the message by the signs which attended it.

<p> But all that had been revealed to them they reported briefly to Peter and his companions. Afterward Jesus himself sent them out, from east to west, the sacred and imperishable proclamation of eternal salvation.

<h1>Zephaniah</h1>
<!-- 001 001 -->


<p class="smallcappara"><span class="chapter" id="001001">1</span><span class="dropcap">T</span>he  <span class="nd"> Lord </span> ’s message, which came to Zephaniah, son of Cushi, son of Gedaliah, son of Amariah, son of Hezekiah, in the time of Josiah of Judah who was son of Amon. 
<h6>The Day of Judgment on Judah</h6>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v036001002" id="001002" >2</span>
 I will utterly destroy everything 
<p class="indent2">  from off the face of the earth, 
<p class="indent3">  says the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v036001003" id="001003" >3</span>
 I will sweep away human and animal, 
<p class="indent2">  the birds of the sky 
<p class="indent2">  and the fish of the sea. 
<p class="indent1">  I will cause the wicked to stumble, 
<p class="indent2">  and I will cut off humanity from the face of the earth, 
<p class="indent3">  says the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v036001004" id="001004" >4</span>
 I will stretch out my hand over Judah 
<p class="indent2">  and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, 
<p class="indent1">  and I will cut off from this place the last remnant of Baal 
<p class="indent2">  and the name of the heathen priests, 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v036001005" id="001005" >5</span>
 and those who worship on the housetops 
<p class="indent2">  to the stars in the sky, 
<p class="indent1">  and those worshippers of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>
<p class="indent2">  who also pay homage to Milcom, 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v036001006" id="001006" >6</span>
 and those who turn back 
<p class="indent2">  from following the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, 
<p class="indent1">  And those who do not seek the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>
<p class="indent2">  nor strive to find him. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v036001007" id="001007" >7</span>
 Be silent before the Lord  <span class="nd"> God </span> , 
<p class="indent2">  for near is the day of the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, 
<p class="indent1">  for the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  has prepared a sacrifice, 
<p class="indent2">  he has sanctified his guests. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v036001008" id="001008" >8</span>
 On the day of the  <span class="nd"> Lord’s </span>  sacrifice: 
<p class="indent1">  I will punish the officers and the royal princes, 
<p class="indent2">  and all those who clothe themselves in foreign apparel. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v036001009" id="001009" >9</span>
 On that day: 
<p class="indent1">  I will punish all who leap over the threshold, 
<p class="indent2">  who fill the house of their lord with violence and deceit. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v036001010" id="001010" >10</span>
 Listen on that day, says the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>: 
<p class="indent1">  A cry will be heard from the Fish Gate, 
<p class="indent2">  and a wailing from the New Quarter, 
<p class="indent2">  and a great din from the hills. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v036001011" id="001011" >11</span>
 Those who live in the Mortar wail, 
<p class="indent2">  for all the traders are silenced, 
<p class="indent2">  the money counters wiped out. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v036001012" id="001012" >12</span>
 I will search Jerusalem with a lamp, 
<p class="indent2">  I will punish those who are at ease, 
<p class="indent1">  who sit comfortably with their wine, 
<p class="indent2">  who say to themselves, 
<p class="indent1">  “the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  brings neither prosperity nor calamity.” <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v036001013" id="001013" >13</span>
 Their wealth will become a prey 
<p class="indent2">  and their houses a desolation. 
<p class="indent1">  Though they build houses, 
<p class="indent2">  they will not inhabit them; 
<p class="indent1">  though they plant vineyards, 
<p class="indent2">  they will not drink wine from them. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v036001014" id="001014" >14</span>
 Near is the day of the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>! 
<p class="indent2">  Near and rapidly approaching! 
<p class="indent1">  Near is the bitter day of the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, 
<p class="indent2">  and the scream of the warrior. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v036001015" id="001015" >15</span>
 That day is a day of wrath, 
<p class="indent2">  a day of trouble and distress, 
<p class="indent1">  a day of destruction and desolation, 
<p class="indent2">  a day of darkness and gloom, 
<p class="indent1">  a day of clouds and thick darkness, 
<p class="indent2"><span class="verse" rel="v036001016" id="001016" >16</span>
 a day of the trumpet and battle-cry, 
<p class="indent1">  against the fortified cities 
<p class="indent2">  and against the high battlements. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v036001017" id="001017" >17</span>
 And I will bring distress upon the people 
<p class="indent2">  and they will walk as the blind, 
<p class="indent2">  because they have sinned against the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, 
<p class="indent1">  and their blood will be poured out as dust 
<p class="indent2">  and their flesh as dung. 
<!-- 001 017 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v036001018" id="001018" >18</span>
 Neither their silver nor their gold will be able to save them. For in the day of the wrath of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  and in the fire of his fury the whole earth will be consumed. For he will make a speedy end of all the inhabitants of the earth. 
<h6>The Imminent Judgment upon the Nations</h6>
<p class="indent1"><span class="chapter" id="002001">2</span> Be ashamed within yourselves, be ashamed, 
<p class="indent2"><span class="verse" rel="v036002002" id="002002" >2</span>
 before you become as the drifting chaff, 
<p class="indent2">  before the anger of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  comes upon you, 
<p class="indent2">  before the day of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span> ’s wrath comes upon you. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v036002003" id="002003" >3</span>
 Seek the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  all you meek of the earth, 
<p class="indent2">  you who obey his law; 
<p class="indent1">  Seek righteousness, seek meekness; 
<p class="indent2">  perhaps you may be hidden in the day of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span> ’s wrath. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v036002004" id="002004" >4</span>
 For Gaza will be forsaken; 
<p class="indent2">  Ashkelon a desolation; 
<p class="indent1">  Ashdod – by noon will they rout her 
<p class="indent2">  and Ekron be torn up! 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v036002005" id="002005" >5</span>
 Woe to those who live by the sea coast, 
<p class="indent2">  people of the Cherethites! 
<p class="indent1">  The word of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  is against you, 
<p class="indent2">  Canaan, land of the Philistines! 
<!-- 002 005 -->


<p>  I will destroy you so that you will be without inhabitants, <span class="verse" rel="v036002006" id="002006" >6</span>
 and you will become shepherds’ cots and folds for flocks. <span class="verse" rel="v036002007" id="002007" >7</span>
 The sea coast will belong to the survivors of the house of Judah.  They will pasture their flocks there. In the house of Ashkelon they will lie down at evening. The  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  their God will be with them and restore their fortunes. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v036002008" id="002008" >8</span>
 I have heard the taunts of Moab, 
<p class="indent2">  and the revilings of the Ammonites, 
<p class="indent1">  how they have taunted my people, 
<p class="indent2">  and spoken boastfully concerning their border. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v036002009" id="002009" >9</span>
 Therefore as I live, says the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  of hosts, the God of Israel: 
<p class="indent2">  Moab will be like Sodom, 
<p class="indent3">  and the Ammonites like Gomorrah, 
<p class="indent2">  a pile of nettles and saltpits, 
<p class="indent3">  and a desolation, forever. 
<p class="indent2">  The residue of my people will plunder them, 
<p class="indent3">  and the survivors of my nation will inherit them. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v036002010" id="002010" >10</span>
 This will they have for their pride, 
<p class="indent2">  because they have taunted and spoken boastfully 
<p class="indent2">  against the people of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  of hosts. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v036002011" id="002011" >11</span>
 The  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  will terrify them; 
<p class="indent2">  he will reduce all the gods of the earth; 
<p class="indent1">  then all the peoples of the nations will worship him, 
<p class="indent2">  each in their own land. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v036002012" id="002012" >12</span>
 You, also, Ethiopians, 
<p class="indent2">  slain by his sword are you! 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v036002013" id="002013" >13</span>
 And he will stretch out his hand 
<p class="indent2">  against the north and destroy Assyria; 
<p class="indent1">  And he will make Nineveh a desolation, 
<p class="indent2">  dry as the wilderness. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v036002014" id="002014" >14</span>
 Herds will lie down in it, 
<p class="indent2">  every beast of the earth, 
<p class="indent1">  Desert owl and screech owl 
<p class="indent2">  will lodge in its capitals. 
<p class="indent1">  The owl will hoot in the window, 
<p class="indent2">  the raven on the doorstep, 
<p class="indent2">  all stripped bare of cedar. 
<!-- 002 014 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v036002015" id="002015" >15</span>
 This is the exultant city which sat secure. The city who said to herself, I am and there is none else! How has she become a desolation! A lair of beasts! Every passerby hisses at her, shakes their hand. 
<h6>Jerusalem’s Deep-seated Corruption</h6>
<p class="indent1"><span class="chapter" id="003001">3</span> Woe to the rebellious and unclean city of oppression, 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v036003002" id="003002" >2</span>
 She has not obeyed the voice, 
<p class="indent2">  she has not accepted instruction, 
<p class="indent1">  In the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  she has not trusted, 
<p class="indent2">  to her God she has not drawn near. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v036003003" id="003003" >3</span>
 Her rulers in her midst are roaring lions. 
<p class="indent1">  Her judges are evening wolves, 
<p class="indent2">  who leave nothing over until the morning, 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v036003004" id="003004" >4</span>
 Her prophets are braggarts, faithless men. 
<p class="indent1">  Her priests profane what is holy 
<p class="indent2">  and do violence to the law. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v036003005" id="003005" >5</span>
 The  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  is righteous in her midst, 
<p class="indent2">  he does no wrong, 
<p class="indent1">  Morning by morning 
<p class="indent2">  he establishes his decree, 
<p class="indent1">  Light is not lacking, 
<p class="indent2">  an oversight is unknown. 
<p class="indent1">  But the unjust know no shame. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v036003006" id="003006" >6</span>
 “I have cut off nations, 
<p class="indent2">  their turrets are destroyed; 
<p class="indent1">  I have laid waste their broad streets, 
<p class="indent2">  so that none passes over them. 
<p class="indent1">  Desolate are their cities without people, 
<p class="indent2">  without inhabitants.” <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v036003007" id="003007" >7</span>
 I said: 
<p class="indent1">  “Surely the city will fear me, 
<p class="indent2">  she will accept instruction. 
<p class="indent1">  Nothing will vanish from her eyes 
<p class="indent2">  that I have impressed upon her; 
<p class="indent1">  But the more zealously have they made all their deeds corrupt.” 
<h6>The Future Vindication and Exultation of Jerusalem</h6>
<!-- 003 007 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v036003008" id="003008" >8</span>
 Wait for me, is the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span> ’s message, until the day when I stand up as a witness, for it is my fixed purpose to gather the nations, to collect the kingdoms, to pour upon them my wrath and my hot anger; for by the fire of my fury will all the earth be consumed. 
<!-- 003 008 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v036003009" id="003009" >9</span>
 For then I will purify the lips of all peoples, so that they will all call on the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span> ’s name, to serve him with one accord. <span class="verse" rel="v036003010" id="003010" >10</span>
 From beyond the rivers of Cush my worshipers will bring me offerings. 
<!-- 003 010 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v036003011" id="003011" >11</span>
 On that day you will no longer be ashamed of all your deeds by which you rebelled against me. For I will rid you of your proudly arrogant ones, and you will never again be haughty on my holy mountain. <span class="verse" rel="v036003012" id="003012" >12</span>
 But I will leave in your midst a people humble and poor, and the remnant of Israel will trust in the name of the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>. <span class="verse" rel="v036003013" id="003013" >13</span>
 They will not do evil, nor speak falsehood, and a deceitful tongue will not be found in their mouth; but they will pasture and lie down, and no one will make them afraid. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v036003014" id="003014" >14</span>
 Cry out with joy, daughter of Zion, 
<p class="indent2">  shout aloud, Israel! 
<p class="indent1">  Rejoice and exult with all your heart, 
<p class="indent2">  daughter of Jerusalem. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v036003015" id="003015" >15</span>
 The  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  has put away your adversaries, 
<p class="indent2">  he has turned away your foes; 
<p class="indent1">  the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  is king in your midst, 
<p class="indent2">  you will fear evil no more. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v036003016" id="003016" >16</span>
 In that day it will be said to Jerusalem: 
<p class="indent2">  Fear not! 
<p class="indent2">  Zion, let not your hands grow weak! 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v036003017" id="003017" >17</span>
 The  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  your God is in your midst, 
<p class="indent2">  a victorious hero. 
<p class="indent1">  He will rejoice over you with joy, 
<p class="indent2">  he will renew his love, 
<p class="indent1">  he will exult over you with singing, 
<p class="indent2"><span class="verse" rel="v036003018" id="003018" >18</span>
 as on a day of festival. <p>
<p class="indent1">  I will take away from you your disgrace, 
<p class="indent2">  and put away from you your reproach. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v036003019" id="003019" >19</span>
 I will destroy at that time 
<p class="indent2">  all who afflict you. 
<p class="indent1">  I will deliver the lame, 
<p class="indent2">  and gather the outcast, 
<p class="indent1">  I will make them an object of renown 
<p class="indent2">  and fame in all the earth. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v036003020" id="003020" >20</span>
 I will do good to you, 
<p class="indent2">  at the time when I gather you. 
<p class="indent1">  For I will make you an object of fame and renown 
<p class="indent2">  among all the peoples of the earth; 
<p class="indent1">  when I bring back your captivity before your eyes. <p>
<p class="indent1">  This says the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>. 
        </p></body>

<h1>Zechariah</h1>
<h6>The Lesson from the Past</h6>
<!-- 001 001 -->


<p class="smallcappara"><span class="chapter" id="001001">1</span><span class="dropcap">I</span>n the eighth month in the second year of Darius, this message of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  came to the prophet Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo: 
<!-- 001 001 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v038001002" id="001002" >2</span>
 The  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  was furious with your ancestors. <span class="verse" rel="v038001003" id="001003" >3</span>
 So tell the people this message of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  of hosts: “Return to me,” says the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  of hosts, “and I will return to you” says the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  of hosts. <span class="verse" rel="v038001004" id="001004" >4</span>
 “Do not be like your ancestors to whom the former prophets cried, ‘The  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  of hosts says to turn now from your evil ways, and from your evil deeds’. They did not heed nor listen to me,” says the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>. <span class="verse" rel="v038001005" id="001005" >5</span>
 “Your ancestors, where are they? And the prophets, do they live forever? <span class="verse" rel="v038001006" id="001006" >6</span>
 But did not my words and my statutes with which I charged my servants the prophets overtake your ancestors? And they repented and said, ‘Just as the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  of hosts planned to do to us, according to our ways, and according to our deeds, so he has dealt with us.’” 
<h6>The Lord’s Jealous Love for Zion</h6>
<!-- 001 006 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v038001007" id="001007" >7</span>
 In the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month, which is the month Shebat, in the second year of Darius, this message of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  came to the prophet Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo: 
<!-- 001 007 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v038001008" id="001008" >8</span>
 I saw in the night a man on a red horse, among the myrtle trees that were in the valley-bottom. Behind him there were horses, red, sorrel, and white. <span class="verse" rel="v038001009" id="001009" >9</span>
 Then said I, “My Lord, what are these?” And the messenger who was talking with me said, “I will show you what they are.” <span class="verse" rel="v038001010" id="001010" >10</span>
 And the man who was standing among the myrtle trees answered, “They are those whom the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  has sent to patrol the earth.” <span class="verse" rel="v038001011" id="001011" >11</span>
 And the riders answered the messenger of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  who was standing among the myrtle trees, “We have gone up and down through the world and behold, all the earth is still and at peace.” 
<!-- 001 011 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v038001012" id="001012" >12</span>
 Then the messenger of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  said, “ <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  of hosts, how long will you have no pity for Jerusalem and the cities of Judah with which you have been angry for seventy years?” <span class="verse" rel="v038001013" id="001013" >13</span>
 And the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  answered the messenger who was talking with me with kind and comforting words. <span class="verse" rel="v038001014" id="001014" >14</span>
 So the messenger who was talking with me said to me, “Proclaim now that the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  of hosts says: I am deeply concerned for Jerusalem. <span class="verse" rel="v038001015" id="001015" >15</span>
 But I am deeply angry with the arrogant, complacent nations. I was only a little angry with Israel but they made the suffering worse. <span class="verse" rel="v038001016" id="001016" >16</span>
 Therefore, says the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, I am turning to show mercy to Jerusalem. My temple will be rebuilt in it, says the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  of hosts, and a measuring line will be stretched over Jerusalem. <span class="verse" rel="v038001017" id="001017" >17</span>
 Proclaim again: Thus says the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  of hosts: My cities will again overflow with prosperity and the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  will again comfort Zion and choose Jerusalem.” 
<h6>Destruction of the Heathen Powers</h6>
<!-- 001 017 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v038001018" id="001018" >18</span>
 Now I looked up and saw four horns. <span class="verse" rel="v038001019" id="001019" >19</span>
 I said to the messenger who was talking with me, “What are these?” He answered, “These are the horns which scattered Judah, Israel and Jerusalem.” 
<!-- 001 019 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v038001020" id="001020" >20</span>
 Then the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  showed me four smiths. <span class="verse" rel="v038001021" id="001021" >21</span>
 I said, “What are these coming to do?” He answered, “The horns scattered Judah, so that no one dared lift their head. But the smiths have come to terrify them, to crush the horns of the nations which lifted up their horn against the land of Judah to scatter its people.” 
<h6>Promise that Jerusalem Will be Gloriously Restored</h6>
<!-- 002 021 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="002001">2</span> Then I looked up and saw a man with a measuring line in his hand. <span class="verse" rel="v038002002" id="002002" >2</span>
 I said, “Where are you going?” He replied, “To measure Jerusalem, to see what is its breadth and length.” <span class="verse" rel="v038002003" id="002003" >3</span>
 Then the messenger who talked with me stepped forward, and another messenger went out to meet him, <span class="verse" rel="v038002004" id="002004" >4</span>
 and said to him, “Run and tell to that young man that Jerusalem will be inhabited like a village without walls, because so many people and cattle will live there. <span class="verse" rel="v038002005" id="002005" >5</span>
 For I, says the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, will be a wall of fire around her, and I will be the glory in the midst of her. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v038002006" id="002006" >6</span>
 Up! Away! Flee from the land of the north, says the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>. 
<p class="indent1"> For I have spread you abroad as the four winds of the heavens, says the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v038002007" id="002007" >7</span>
 Up, escape to Zion, you who live in Babylon. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v038002008" id="002008" >8</span>
 This is what the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  of hosts says to the nations which plundered you: 
<p class="indent1"> Whoever touches you touches the apple of my eye. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v038002009" id="002009" >9</span>
 I will raise my hand against them. 
<p class="indent1"> They will be plunder for their own slaves; and you will know that the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  of hosts has sent me. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v038002010" id="002010" >10</span>
 “Sing and rejoice, daughter of Zion! I am coming, 
<p class="indent1"> I will live among you, says the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v038002011" id="002011" >11</span>
 Many nations will join themselves to the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  in that day, 
<p class="indent1"> and will be his people, and he will live among you. 
<p class="indent1"> You will know that the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  of hosts has sent me to you. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v038002012" id="002012" >12</span>
 The  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  will inherit Judah as his portion in the holy land. 
<p class="indent1"> He will again choose Jerusalem. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v038002013" id="002013" >13</span>
 Be silent, everyone, in the presence of the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, 
<p class="indent1"> because he is coming from his holy dwelling.” 
<h6>Purification of the Priesthood and Nation</h6>
<!-- 003 013 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="003001">3</span> Then he showed me Joshua, the high priest, standing before the messenger of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  and the Adversary standing at his right hand to accuse him. <span class="verse" rel="v038003002" id="003002" >2</span>
 And the messenger of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  said to the Adversary, “May the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  rebuke you, Adversary! The  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, who has chosen Jerusalem, rebuke you! Is not this man a brand plucked out of the fire?” <span class="verse" rel="v038003003" id="003003" >3</span>
 Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments and was standing before the messenger. <span class="verse" rel="v038003004" id="003004" >4</span>
 The messenger said to those who stood before him, “Take off his filthy garments.” Then to Joshua he said, “I have taken your guilt from you and I will clothe you in priestly robes.” <span class="verse" rel="v038003005" id="003005" >5</span>
 And he ordered: “Set a clean turban upon his head.” So they set a clean turban on his head, and clothed him with garments. The messenger of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  was standing by. 
<!-- 003 005 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v038003006" id="003006" >6</span>
 And the messenger of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  testified to Joshua: <span class="verse" rel="v038003007" id="003007" >7</span>
 The  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  of hosts says: “If you walk in my ways, and if you will keep my instructions, then you will rule my house and keep my courts and I will give you a place of access among these that stand by. <span class="verse" rel="v038003008" id="003008" >8</span>
 Hear now, Joshua the high priest, you and your associates who sit before me; for they are men who are a sign; for I am going to bring forth my servant the Branch. <span class="verse" rel="v038003009" id="003009" >9</span>
 On the stone that I have set before Joshua, on one stone, are seven facets. I will engrave it,” says the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  of hosts, “and I will remove the guilt of that land in one day. <span class="verse" rel="v038003010" id="003010" >10</span>
 On that day,” says the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  of hosts, “you will each invite your neighbor under the vine and under the fig tree.” 
<h6>The Supporters of the Temple Service</h6>
<!-- 004 010 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="004001">4</span> Then the messenger who talked with me came again and woke me, as someone who is woken from sleep. <span class="verse" rel="v038004002" id="004002" >2</span>
 He said to me, “What do you see?” I said, “I see a candlestick, all of gold, with a bowl on its top, and seven lamps on it. There are seven pipes to each of the lamps, which are on its top, <span class="verse" rel="v038004003" id="004003" >3</span>
 and two olive trees next to it, one on the right side of the bowl, and the other on its left side.” <span class="verse" rel="v038004004" id="004004" >4</span>
 I said to the messenger who talked with me, “What are these, my lord?” <span class="verse" rel="v038004005" id="004005" >5</span>
 Then the messenger who talked with me answered, “Don’t you know what these are?” And I said. “No, my lord.” <span class="verse" rel="v038004006" id="004006" >6</span>
 He said to me, “This is the message of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  regarding Zerubbabel: Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, says the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  of hosts, <span class="verse" rel="v038004007" id="004007" >7</span>
 will I make the great mountain before Zerubbabel a plain. He will bring forth the top stones with shoutings of, ‘Grace, grace, to it.’” <span class="verse" rel="v038004008" id="004008" >8</span>
 Moreover this message of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  came to me: <span class="verse" rel="v038004009" id="004009" >9</span>
 The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house. His hands will also finish it. Then you will know that the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  of hosts has sent me to you. <span class="verse" rel="v038004010" id="004010" >10</span>
 For who has despised the day of small things? They will rejoice, and will see the plumb line in the hand of Zerubbabel. (The seven lamps are the eyes of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  that search all around the world.) <span class="verse" rel="v038004011" id="004011" >11</span>
 Again I asked, “What are these two olive trees on the right side of the candlestick and on its left side?” <span class="verse" rel="v038004012" id="004012" >12</span>
 Again, “What are these two branches of the olive trees, which are pouring out the golden oil through the two golden pipes?” <span class="verse" rel="v038004013" id="004013" >13</span>
 He answered me, “Don’t you now what these are?” And I said, “No, my lord.” <span class="verse" rel="v038004014" id="004014" >14</span>
 Then he explained, “They are the two anointed ones who attend the Lord of all the earth.” 
<h6>The Flying Scroll</h6>
<!-- 005 014 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="005001">5</span> Then again I looked up and saw a flying scroll. <span class="verse" rel="v038005002" id="005002" >2</span>
 He said to me, “What do you see?” I answered, “I see a flying scroll; twenty cubits long, ten cubits wide.” <span class="verse" rel="v038005003" id="005003" >3</span>
 Then he said to me, “This is the curse that goes over the whole land. Every thief will be banished according to the writing on one side and everyone who lies under oath shall be banished according to the writing on the other side. <span class="verse" rel="v038005004" id="005004" >4</span>
 I have sent it out, says the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  of hosts, and it will enter into the house of the thief, and into the house of anyone who swears falsely by my name. It will remain in the midst of his house and will consume it with its timber and its stones.” 
<h6>The Woman in an Ephah</h6>
<!-- 005 004 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v038005005" id="005005" >5</span>
 Then the messenger who talked with me came forward, and said to me, “Look up and see what is now coming.” <span class="verse" rel="v038005006" id="005006" >6</span>
 I said. “What is it?” He said, “It is a measuring basket, full of the guilt of the land.” <span class="verse" rel="v038005007" id="005007" >7</span>
 A round leaden cover was lifted up, and there was a woman sitting in the middle of the basket. <span class="verse" rel="v038005008" id="005008" >8</span>
 He said, “This is Wickedness.” He thrust her down into the midst of the basket and he pushed the round leaden cover back on its mouth. <span class="verse" rel="v038005009" id="005009" >9</span>
 Then I looked up and saw two women, and the wind was in their wings. They had wings like the wings of a stork and they lifted up the basket between them. <span class="verse" rel="v038005010" id="005010" >10</span>
 Then I said to the messenger who talked with me, “Where are they taking the basket?” <span class="verse" rel="v038005011" id="005011" >11</span>
 He said to me, “To build her a house in the land of Shinar. When it is prepared, they will rest the basket there.” 
<h6>The War-Chariots of the Lord</h6>
<!-- 006 011 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="006001">6</span> Again I looked up, and saw four chariots come from between two mountains. The mountains were mountains of bronze. <span class="verse" rel="v038006002" id="006002" >2</span>
 The first chariot had red horses. The second chariot had black horses, <span class="verse" rel="v038006003" id="006003" >3</span>
 the third chariot white horses, and the fourth chariot dappled horses. <span class="verse" rel="v038006004" id="006004" >4</span>
 Then I said to the messenger who talked with me, “What are these, my lord?” <span class="verse" rel="v038006005" id="006005" >5</span>
 The messenger answered me, “These are the four winds of heaven going out after standing before the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  of all the earth. <span class="verse" rel="v038006006" id="006006" >6</span>
 The black horses are going toward the north country and the white toward the west and the dappled toward the south country.” <span class="verse" rel="v038006007" id="006007" >7</span>
 The strong horses came out, and were impatient to patrol the earth. So he said, “Go, patrol the earth,” and they did so. <span class="verse" rel="v038006008" id="006008" >8</span>
 Then he cried out to me, “The horses that went to the north country will quiet my spirit in the north country.” 
<h6>Preparations for the Crowning of Zerubbabel</h6>
<!-- 006 008 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v038006009" id="006009" >9</span>
 Now this message of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  came to me: <span class="verse" rel="v038006010" id="006010" >10</span>
 Take the gifts from the exiles Heldai, Tobijah and Jedaiah who have come from Babylon and go at once to Josiah the son of Zephaniah. <span class="verse" rel="v038006011" id="006011" >11</span>
 Take their silver and gold and make a crown and set it on the head of the high priest, Joshua son of Jehozadak.

 Tell him: “Thus says the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  of hosts: Behold, the man whose name is the Branch. He will branch out from his place and rebuild the temple of the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>. <span class="verse" rel="v038006013" id="006013" >13</span>
 He will rebuild the temple and will sit and rule upon his throne, receiving the honor due to a king. A priest will stand by his throne and they will work together in peace and harmony. <span class="verse" rel="v038006014" id="006014" >14</span>
 The crown will be a memorial in the temple of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  for Heldai and Tobijah and Jedaiah, and Josiah the son of Zephaniah. <span class="verse" rel="v038006015" id="006015" >15</span>
 People from far away will come and build in the temple of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  and you will know that the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  of hosts has sent me to you. This will happen if you diligently obey the voice of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  your God.”

<p><span class="chapter" id="007001">7</span> In the fourth year of the reign of King Darius, on the fourth day of Chislev, the ninth month, the message of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  came to Zechariah. <span class="verse" rel="v038007002" id="007002" >2</span>
 The city of Bethel had sent Sharezer and Regem-melech and their men, to entreat the favor of the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, <span class="verse" rel="v038007003" id="007003" >3</span>
 and to ask the priests of the house of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  of hosts, and the prophets “Should I continue to mourn in the fifth month, separating myself, as I have done for many years?” <span class="verse" rel="v038007004" id="007004" >4</span>
 Then this message of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  of hosts came to me: <span class="verse" rel="v038007005" id="007005" >5</span>
 Tell all the people of the land and the priests, “When you fasted and mourned in the fifth and in the seventh month, for these seventy years, did you really fast for me? <span class="verse" rel="v038007006" id="007006" >6</span>
 When you eat and when you drink, do you not eat for yourselves, and drink for yourselves? <span class="verse" rel="v038007007" id="007007" >7</span>
 Wasn’t it this which the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  proclaimed by the earlier prophets, when Jerusalem was inhabited and prosperous, and her towns surrounding her and the Negreb and the Shephelah were inhabited?”

<p><span class="verse" rel="v038007008" id="007008" >8</span>
 The  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  gave this message to Zechariah: <span class="verse" rel="v038007009" id="007009" >9</span>
 The  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  of hosts says, execute true judgments. Show kindness and mercy to each other. <span class="verse" rel="v038007010" id="007010" >10</span>
 Do not oppress the widow or the orphan, the resident foreigner or the poor. Let none of you devise evil against another in your hearts.

<p><span class="verse" rel="v038007011" id="007011" >11</span>
 But they refused to listen, and turned a stubborn shoulder, and stopped their ears so they wouldn’t hear. <span class="verse" rel="v038007012" id="007012" >12</span>
 They made their hearts as hard as stone so they wouldn’t accept the teaching and the words that the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  of hosts had sent by his spirit through the earlier prophets. Great was the anger of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  of hosts: <span class="verse" rel="v038007013" id="007013" >13</span>
 I called and they would not hear, so they call and I do not hear, says the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  of hosts. <span class="verse" rel="v038007014" id="007014" >14</span>
 I scattered them by a whirlwind out among nations unknown to them. The land was left desolate behind them, with no one crossing or returning, for they made the pleasant land a desolation.

<p><span class="chapter" id="008001">8</span> Now this message of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  of hosts came to me: 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v038008002" id="008002" >2</span>
 The  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  of hosts says: 
<p class="indent1"> I passionately care for Zion, 
<p class="indent1"> and I am fiercely protective of her. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v038008003" id="008003" >3</span>
 The  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  says, I have returned to Zion, 
<p class="indent1"> and will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem 
<p class="indent1"> and Jerusalem will be called, ‘The City of Truth’ 
<p class="indent1"> and the mountain of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  of hosts, ‘The Holy Mountain.’ 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v038008004" id="008004" >4</span>
 The  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  of hosts says: 
<p class="indent1"> Old men and old women will sit again in the squares of Jerusalem, 
<p class="indent1"> each leaning on a staff because of old age. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v038008005" id="008005" >5</span>
 And the streets of the city will be full of boys, 
<p class="indent1"> and of girls playing in its squares. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v038008006" id="008006" >6</span>
 The  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  of hosts says: 
<p class="indent1"> Just because it seems impossible to the remnant of this people in these days, 
<p class="indent1"> is it also impossible for me? says the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  of hosts. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v038008007" id="008007" >7</span>
 The  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  of hosts says: 
<p class="indent1"> I will rescue my people 
<p class="indent1"> from the land of the east and the land of the west. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v038008008" id="008008" >8</span>
 I will bring them and they will live in Jerusalem,

<!-- 008 008 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v038008009" id="008009" >9</span>
 The  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  of hosts says: Let your hands be strong, you who hear in these days the words of the prophets spoken when the foundations for the house of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  of hosts were laid. <span class="verse" rel="v038008010" id="008010" >10</span>
 For before those days there were no wages for people or animals. No one could go out or return safe from enemies, because I set each against their neighbor. <span class="verse" rel="v038008011" id="008011" >11</span>
 But now I will treat the remnant of the people differently from former days, says the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  of hosts. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v038008012" id="008012" >12</span>
 Peace will be sown. 
<p class="indent1"> The vine will bear its fruit and the ground will yield its produce,

<p class="indent1"> I will give the remnant of this people all these things. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v038008013" id="008013" >13</span>

<p class="indent1"> Do not be afraid, but let your hands be strong.

<p><span class="verse" rel="v038008014" id="008014" >14</span>
 For the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  of hosts says: As I planned to do evil to you when your ancestors provoked me to anger, says the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  of hosts, and I did not relent, <span class="verse" rel="v038008015" id="008015" >15</span>
 so again have I planned in these days to do good to Jerusalem and to the house of Judah. Do not be afraid. 
<!-- 008 015 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v038008016" id="008016" >16</span>
 These are the things that you should do: Speak the truth to each other. Render peaceful decisions in your gates. <span class="verse" rel="v038008017" id="008017" >17</span>
 Let none of you devise evil in your heart against one another. Do not love perjury. All these are things I hate, says the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>.

<p><span class="verse" rel="v038008018" id="008018" >18</span>
 And this message of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  of hosts came to me: <span class="verse" rel="v038008019" id="008019" >19</span>
 The  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  of hosts says: The fast of the fourth month, and the fast of the fifth, and the fast of the seventh, and the fast of the tenth, will be festivals of joy and gladness, and cheerful feasts for the house of Judah. Therefore love truth and peace.

<p><span class="verse" rel="v038008020" id="008020" >20</span>
 The  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  of hosts says: Peoples, and the inhabitants of many cities will come, <span class="verse" rel="v038008021" id="008021" >21</span>
 and the inhabitants of one city will go to another, saying, “Let us go speedily to entreat the favor of the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, and to seek the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  of hosts; I will go also.” <span class="verse" rel="v038008022" id="008022" >22</span>

<h6>The Conquest of Israel’s Foes</h6>
<p class="indent1"><span class="chapter" id="009001">9</span> An oracle: 
<p class="indent1"> The message of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  concerns the land of Hadrach, 
<p class="indent1"> it rests upon Damascus. 
<p class="indent1"> For the capital of Aram belongs to the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, 
<p class="indent1"> as the tribes of Israel do, 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v038009002" id="009002" >2</span>
 and also Hamath which borders on it. 
<p class="indent1"> Tyre and Sidon, for all their wisdom. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v038009003" id="009003" >3</span>
 Tyre built for herself a fortress. 
<p class="indent1"> Heaped up silver as dust, 
<p class="indent1"> and gold like the dirt of the streets. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v038009004" id="009004" >4</span>
 But now the Lord will dispossess her, 
<p class="indent1"> cast down her rampart into the sea. 
<p class="indent1"> She will be consumed in fire. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v038009005" id="009005" >5</span>
 Ashkelon will see and fear, 
<p class="indent1"> and Gaza writhe in anguish, 
<p class="indent1"> Ekron, also for her hope will be put to shame. 
<p class="indent1"> The king will perish from Gaza, 
<p class="indent1"> Ashkelon will remain uninhabited. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v038009006" id="009006" >6</span>
 A foreign people will settle in Ashdod, 
<p class="indent1"> and I will humble the pride of the Philistines. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v038009007" id="009007" >7</span>
 I will take their blood from their mouth, 
<p class="indent1"> and their abominations from between their teeth. 
<p class="indent1"> They also will be a remnant for our God, 
<p class="indent1"> like a clan in Judah, 
<p class="indent1"> and Ekron will be like the Jebusites. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v038009008" id="009008" >8</span>
 But I will encamp as a guard about my house, 
<p class="indent1"> so that none will pass through or return, 
<p class="indent1"> and no oppressor will pass through them again, 
<p class="indent1"> for now I have seen with my own eyes. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v038009009" id="009009" >9</span>
 Rejoice greatly, daughter of Zion! 
<p class="indent1"> Shout aloud, daughter of Jerusalem! 
<p class="indent1"> Look, your king comes to you. 
<p class="indent1"> Vindicated and victorious is he, 
<p class="indent1"> humble, and riding on a donkey, 
<p class="indent1"> on a colt, the foal of a donkey. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v038009010" id="009010" >10</span>
 He will cut off chariots from Ephraim, 
<p class="indent1"> and war horses from Jerusalem. 
<p class="indent1"> The battle bow will be cut off, 
<p class="indent1"> and he will speak peace to the nations. 
<p class="indent1"> His rule will be from sea to sea, 
<p class="indent1"> from the river to the ends of the earth. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v038009011" id="009011" >11</span>
 And you, too – because of your blood covenant, 
<p class="indent1"> I have set free your prisoners from the waterless pit. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v038009012" id="009012" >12</span>
 To the stronghold will the prisoners of hope return. 
<p class="indent1"> This day I declare, I will restore double to you. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v038009013" id="009013" >13</span>
 For I have bent Judah to me, 
<p class="indent1"> like a bow which I have filled with Ephraim like an arrow. 
<p class="indent1"> I will urge your sons, Zion, against the sons of Greece, 
<p class="indent1"> I will make you like the sword of a hero. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v038009014" id="009014" >14</span>
 Then the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  will be seen above them 
<p class="indent1"> and his arrow will go forth like lightning. 
<p class="indent1"> The  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  will blow a blast upon a trumpet, 
<p class="indent1"> and travel on the whirlwinds of the south. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v038009015" id="009015" >15</span>
 The  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  of hosts will defend them. 
<p class="indent1"> They will devour and tread down the slingstones, 
<p class="indent1"> they will drink their blood like wine, 
<p class="indent1"> they will be full like a bowl, 
<p class="indent1"> like the crevices of the altar. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v038009016" id="009016" >16</span>
 And the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  their God will save them on that day, 
<p class="indent1"> as the flock of his people, 
<p class="indent1"> as the jewel of a crown 
<p class="indent1"> shining in his land. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v038009017" id="009017" >17</span>
 How good and how beautiful will it be!

<p><span class="verse" rel="v038011004" id="011004" >4</span>
 The  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  said to me: shepherd the flock destined for slaughter, <span class="verse" rel="v038011005" id="011005" >5</span>
 whose possessors slaughter them, and hold themselves not guilty! The people who sell them say, Blessed be the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, for I am rich! And their own shepherds have no compassion for them. <span class="verse" rel="v038011006" id="011006" >6</span>
 I will no longer have pity on the people of this earth, says the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>. I will turn neighbor against neighbor, and put everyone under the power of a king, and when the land is devastated I will not rescue them. <span class="verse" rel="v038011007" id="011007" >7</span>
 So I shepherded the flock of slaughter for the sheep-merchants. I took two staffs: one I called Mercy and the other I called Union. So I shepherded the sheep. <span class="verse" rel="v038011008" id="011008" >8</span>
 I set aside three of the shepherds in one month; for I was indignant against them, and they also were displeased at me. <span class="verse" rel="v038011009" id="011009" >9</span>
 I said, I will not shepherd you. What is dead, let it die. What is set aside, let it be set aside. And let those who are left devour one another’s flesh. <span class="verse" rel="v038011010" id="011010" >10</span>
 And I took my staff, Mercy, and broke it, so as to break my covenant which I had made with all the peoples. 
<!-- 011 010 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v038011011" id="011011" >11</span>
 In that day it was broken, and the sheep-merchants who watched me knew that it was the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span> ’s message. <span class="verse" rel="v038011012" id="011012" >12</span>
 And I said to them, “If it is good in your sight, give me my wage. If not, don’t.” So they weighed out my wage, thirty pieces of silver. <span class="verse" rel="v038011013" id="011013" >13</span>
 And the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  said to me, Cast it into the treasury – the precious wage that at which I was valued by them! So I took the thirty pieces of silver and cast them into the house of the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, into the treasury. 
<!-- 011 013 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v038011014" id="011014" >14</span>
 Then I broke my second staff called Union so as to dissolve the brotherhood between Judah and Jerusalem. <span class="verse" rel="v038011015" id="011015" >15</span>
 And the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  said to me: Take again the implements of a worthless shepherd. <span class="verse" rel="v038011016" id="011016" >16</span>
 For I am about to appoint a shepherd over the land. Those who are thrust down he will not visit. Those who are scattered he will not seek out. The wounded he will not heal, the sick he will not make whole, but the flesh of the fat he will devour and even their hoofs he will tear. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v038011017" id="011017" >17</span>
 Woe to my worthless shepherd, who deserts the flock! 
<p class="indent1"> May the sword strike his arm and his right eye. 
<p class="indent1"> May his arm completely wither. 
<p class="indent1"> And his right eye be blinded. 
<h6>Jerusalem’s Deliverance from Heathen Attack</h6>
<!-- 012 017 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="012001">12</span> An oracle. This is the message of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  about Israel. The  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  who stretches out the heavens, and lays the foundation of the earth, and forms the human spirit within people says: 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v038012002" id="012002" >2</span>
 Look! I am about to make Jerusalem 
<p class="indent1"> a cup of drunkenness for all the surrounding peoples. 
<p class="indent1"> There will be a siege of Jerusalem. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v038012003" id="012003" >3</span>
 On that day that I will make Jerusalem 
<p class="indent1"> a stone to be lifted up by all the peoples. 
<p class="indent1"> All who lift it up will surely hurt themselves! 
<p class="indent1"> And all the nations of the earth will be gathered together against it. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v038012004" id="012004" >4</span>
 On that day, says the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, I will strike 
<p class="indent1"> every horse with panic and its rider with madness. 
<p class="indent1"> But over the house of Judah I will keep watch, 
<p class="indent1"> though I strike every horse belonging to the peoples with blindness. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v038012005" id="012005" >5</span>
 And the chieftains of Judah will say to themselves, 
<p class="indent1"> “The strength of the inhabitants is in the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  of hosts their God.” <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v038012006" id="012006" >6</span>
 In that day I will make the chieftains of Judah 
<p class="indent1"> like a pan of fire in the woods, 
<p class="indent1"> like a torch among sheaves, 
<p class="indent1"> they will devour right and left all the surrounding peoples. 
<p class="indent1"> But Jerusalem will abide on its own site. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v038012007" id="012007" >7</span>
 And the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  will first give victory to the tents of Judah, 
<p class="indent1"> so that the glory of the house of David, and of the inhabitants of Jerusalem be not exalted above Judah. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v038012008" id="012008" >8</span>
 In that day the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  will protect the inhabitants of Jerusalem, 
<p class="indent1"> and the feeblest among them will in that day be like David, 
<p class="indent1"> and the house of David like God, like the messenger of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  before them. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v038012009" id="012009" >9</span>
 And in that day I will seek to destroy all the nations who have come up against Jerusalem. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v038012010" id="012010" >10</span>
 And I will pour out on the house of David and the inhabitants of Jerusalem 
<p class="indent1"> the spirit of pity and compassion. They will look on him whom they have pierced 
<p class="indent1"> and they will lament for him as one laments for an only son. 
<p class="indent1"> They will bitterly grieve for him as one grieves for the firstborn. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v038012011" id="012011" >11</span>
 In that day mourning will be as great in Jerusalem 
<p class="indent1"> as the mourning for Hadad-rimmon in the plain of Megiddo. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v038012012" id="012012" >12</span>
 And the land will mourn, each family by itself: 
<p class="indent1"> the family of the house of David by itself, 
<p class="indent1"> and their wives by themselves, 
<p class="indent1"> and the family of the house of Nathan by itself, 
<p class="indent1"> and their wives by themselves, 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v038012013" id="012013" >13</span>
 and the family of the house of Levi by itself, 
<p class="indent1"> and their wives by themselves, 
<p class="indent1"> the family of the Shimeites by itself, 
<p class="indent1"> and their wives by themselves, 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v038012014" id="012014" >14</span>
 and all the families who are left, each by itself, 
<p class="indent1"> and their wives by themselves. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="chapter" id="013001">13</span> On that day a fountain will be opened for the house of David, 
<p class="indent1"> and for the inhabitants of Jerusalem, for sin and for uncleanness. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v038013002" id="013002" >2</span>
 And it will be on that day, says the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  of hosts, 
<p class="indent1"> I will cut off the names of the idols from the land and they will be remembered no more. 
<p class="indent1"> And the prophets and the unclean spirit I will banish from the land. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v038013003" id="013003" >3</span>
 If any man prophesy any more, 
<p class="indent1"> his father and his mother who bore him, will say to him, 
<p class="indent1"> “You will not live, for you speak falsehood in the name of the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>.” 
<p class="indent1"> And his father and his mother who bore him will stab him through when he is seized by the prophetic frenzy. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v038013004" id="013004" >4</span>
 And it will be in that day that the prophets will be ashamed, each of his vision, 
<p class="indent1"> and will not wear the hairy mantle in order to deceive. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v038013005" id="013005" >5</span>
 Each will say, “I am not a prophet, 
<p class="indent1"> a tiller of the ground am I, for the ground is my possession from my youth.” 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v038013006" id="013006" >6</span>
 And they will say to him, “What are these scars on your back?” 
<p class="indent1"> And he will say, “The scars which I received in the house of my friends.” <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v038013007" id="013007" >7</span>
 Awake, sword, against my shepherd, 
<p class="indent1"> against the man who stands near to me, 
<p class="indent1"> says the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  of hosts. 
<p class="indent1"> I will strike the shepherd so that the sheep may be scattered, 
<p class="indent1"> I will turn my hand against the little ones. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v038013008" id="013008" >8</span>
 In all the land, says the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, 
<p class="indent1"> two-thirds in it will be cut off and die, 
<p class="indent1"> but a third will be left in it. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v038013009" id="013009" >9</span>
 I will bring the third into the fire, 
<p class="indent1"> and melt it as one melts silver, 
<p class="indent1"> and test it as one tests gold. 
<p class="indent1"> Then they will call on my name, 
<p class="indent1"> and I myself will answer them. 
<p class="indent1"> I will say, “They are my people.” 
<p class="indent1"> They will say, “The  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  is our God.” 
<h6>The Judgment upon the Heathen and the Exaltation of the Lord</h6>
<!-- 014 009 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="014001">14</span> A day is coming for the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, when your plundered possessions will be divided while you watch. <span class="verse" rel="v038014002" id="014002" >2</span>
 And all the nations will gather to Jerusalem, to fight against it. The city will be taken and the houses plundered and the women raped. Half of the city will go into captivity, and the rest of the people left in the ruins. <span class="verse" rel="v038014003" id="014003" >3</span>
 Then the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  will go forth and fight against these nations, as once he fought in the day of battle. <span class="verse" rel="v038014004" id="014004" >4</span>
 On that day his feet will stand on the Mount of Olives, (which is opposite Jerusalem, on the east). The Mount of Olives will be split into halves, from east to west, by an exceedingly great valley; and half of the mountain will slide northwards and half southwards. <span class="verse" rel="v038014005" id="014005" >5</span>
 You will escape through my valley – the valley between the hills will extend as far as Azel, and you will flee as you fled from before the earthquake, in the days of Uzziah king of Judah. But the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  your God will come, and all the holy ones with him. 
<!-- 014 005 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v038014006" id="014006" >6</span>
 And in that day, there will be no heat nor cold nor frost, <span class="verse" rel="v038014007" id="014007" >7</span>
 but it will be constant day – it is known to the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  – with neither day nor night. Even at evening time there will be light. <span class="verse" rel="v038014008" id="014008" >8</span>
 And on that day living waters will flow from Jerusalem, half of them to the eastern sea and half of them to the western sea; in both summer and winter. <span class="verse" rel="v038014009" id="014009" >9</span>
 The  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  will be king over all the earth. On that day the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  will be one, and his name one. <span class="verse" rel="v038014010" id="014010" >10</span>
 The land will be changed to plain, from Geba to Rimmon, south of Jerusalem, but Jerusalem will be high and inhabited as it stands, from the Benjamin Gate up to the place of the first gate, and from the Tower of Hananel to the Corner Gate, and as far as the king’s winepresses. <span class="verse" rel="v038014011" id="014011" >11</span>
 Jerusalem will be inhabited, for never again will it be doomed to destruction, and its people will abide in security. <p>
<!-- 014 011 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v038014012" id="014012" >12</span>
 This is the plague with which the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  will strike all the peoples who array themselves against Jerusalem: he will make their flesh rot while they stand on their feet, and their eyes will rot in their sockets, and their tongues will rot in their mouth. <span class="verse" rel="v038014013" id="014013" >13</span>
 On that day a great panic sent by the Lord will fall on them. Everyone will seize their neighbours and attack them. <span class="verse" rel="v038014014" id="014014" >14</span>
 Even Judah will fight at Jerusalem, and the wealth of the surrounding nations will be gathered up – gold and silver and piles of clothing. <span class="verse" rel="v038014015" id="014015" >15</span>
 Plague will fall upon the horses, mules, camels, and asses, and on all the animals in all those camps. 
<!-- 014 015 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v038014016" id="014016" >16</span>
 All who are left of all the nations which fought against Jerusalem will come up from year to year to worship the King, the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  of hosts, and to keep the pilgrim-feast of tabernacles. <span class="verse" rel="v038014017" id="014017" >17</span>
 Whoever of all the peoples of the earth will not come up to Jerusalem to worship the King, the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  of hosts, on them there will be no rain. <span class="verse" rel="v038014018" id="014018" >18</span>
 If the family of Egypt does not go up nor enter in, on them also will come the plague with which the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  will strike the nations. <span class="verse" rel="v038014019" id="014019" >19</span>
 This will be the punishment for the sin of Egypt and the punishment for the sin of all nations which do not come up to keep the feast of the tabernacles. 
<!-- 014 019 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v038014020" id="014020" >20</span>
 On that day there will be inscribed upon the bells of the horses, ‘Holy to the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span> ’ and the pots in the house of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  will be as holy as the sacrificial bowls before the altars. <span class="verse" rel="v038014021" id="014021" >21</span>
 Every pot in Jerusalem and in Judah will be holy to the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  of hosts and all who sacrifice will come and take of them and cook the sacrifices in them. There will be no more traffickers in the house of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  of hosts in that day.

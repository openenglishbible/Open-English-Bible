 Jesse of David the King. David was the father of Solomon, whose mother was Uriah’s widow, <span class="verse" rel="v040001007" id="001007" >7</span>
 Solomon of Rehoboam, Rehoboam of Abijah, Abijah of Asa, <span class="verse" rel="v040001008" id="001008" >8</span>
 Asa of Jehoshaphat, Jehoshaphat of Joram, Joram of Uzziah, <span class="verse" rel="v040001009" id="001009" >9</span>
 Uzziah of Jotham, Jotham of Ahaz, Ahaz of Hezekiah, <span class="verse" rel="v040001010" id="001010" >10</span>
 Hezekiah of Manasseh, Manasseh of Amon, Amon of Josiah, <span class="verse" rel="v040001011" id="001011" >11</span>
 Josiah of Jechoniah and his brothers, at the time of the Exile to Babylon. <span class="verse" rel="v040001012" id="001012" >12</span>
 After the Exile to Babylon – Jechoniah was the father of Salathiel, Salathiel of Zerubbabel, <span class="verse" rel="v040001013" id="001013" >13</span>
 Zerubbabel of Abiud, Abiud of Eliakim, Eliakim of Azor, <span class="verse" rel="v040001014" id="001014" >14</span>

 Jacob of Joseph, the husband of Mary, who was the mother of Jesus, who is called ‘Christ’. <span class="verse" rel="v040001017" id="001017" >17</span>
 So the whole number of generations from Abraham to David is fourteen; from David to the Exile to Babylon fourteen; and from the Exile to Babylon to the Christ fourteen. <p>
<!-- 001 017 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v040001018" id="001018" >18</span>
 This is how Jesus Christ was born: 
<!-- 001 018 -->


<p> His mother Mary was engaged to Joseph, but, before the marriage took place, she found herself to be pregnant by the power of the Holy Spirit. <span class="verse" rel="v040001019" id="001019" >19</span>
 Her husband, Joseph, was a just man and, since he did not want to disgrace her publicly, he resolved to put an end to their engagement privately. <span class="verse" rel="v040001020" id="001020" >20</span>
 He had been thinking this over, when an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream. 
<!-- 001 020 -->


<p> “Joseph, son of David,” the angel said, “do not be afraid to take Mary for your wife, for her child has been conceived by the power of the Holy Spirit. <span class="verse" rel="v040001021" id="001021" >21</span>
 She will give birth to a son; name him Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins.” 
<!-- 001 021 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v040001022" id="001022" >22</span>
 All this happened in fulfillment of these words of the Lord through the prophet, where he says – 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v040001023" id="001023" >23</span>
 ‘The virgin will conceive and will give birth to a son, and they will give him the name Immanuel’ <p>
<!-- 001 023 -->


<p> – a word which means ‘God is with us.’ <span class="verse" rel="v040001024" id="001024" >24</span>
 When Joseph woke up, he did as the angel of the Lord had directed him. <span class="verse" rel="v040001025" id="001025" >25</span>
 He made Mary his wife, but they did not sleep together before the birth of her son; and to this son he gave the name Jesus. <p>
<!-- 002 025 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="002001">2</span> After the birth of Jesus at Bethlehem in Judea, in the reign of King Herod, some astrologers from the East arrived in Jerusalem, asking, <span class="verse" rel="v040002002" id="002002" >2</span>
 “Where is the newborn king of the Jews? For we saw his star in the east, and have come to worship him.” <span class="verse" rel="v040002003" id="002003" >3</span>
 When King Herod heard of this, he was much troubled, and so too was all Jerusalem. <span class="verse" rel="v040002004" id="002004" >4</span>
 He called together all the chief priests and teachers of the Law in the nation, and questioned them as to where the Christ was to be born. 
<!-- 002 004 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v040002005" id="002005" >5</span>
 “At Bethlehem in Judea,” was their answer, “for it is said in the prophet – 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v040002006" id="002006" >6</span>
 ‘And you, Bethlehem in Judah’s land, 
<p class="indent2"> are in no way least among the chief cities of Judah, 
<p class="indent1"> for out of you will come a ruler – 
<p class="indent2"> who will shepherd my people Israel.’” 
<!-- 002 006 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v040002007" id="002007" >7</span>
 Then Herod secretly sent for the astrologers. He found out from them the time of the appearance of the star. <span class="verse" rel="v040002008" id="002008" >8</span>
 Sending them to Bethlehem he said, “Go and make a careful search for the child. When you have found him, bring word back to me, so that I, too, can go and worship him.” <span class="verse" rel="v040002009" id="002009" >9</span>
 The astrologers heard what the king had to say, and then continued their journey. The star which they had seen in the east led them on, until it reached and stood over the place where the child was. <span class="verse" rel="v040002010" id="002010" >10</span>
 At the sight of the star they were filled with joy. <span class="verse" rel="v040002011" id="002011" >11</span>
 Entering the house, they saw the child with his mother, Mary, and fell at his feet and worshiped him. Then they opened their treasure chests, and offered to the child presents of gold, frankincense, and myrrh. <span class="verse" rel="v040002012" id="002012" >12</span>
 But afterward, having been warned in a dream not to go back to Herod, they returned to their own country by another road. 
<!-- 002 012 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v040002013" id="002013" >13</span>
 After they had left, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream, and said, “Get up, take the child and his mother, and seek refuge in Egypt; and stay there until I tell you to return, for Herod is about to search for the child, to put him to death.” <span class="verse" rel="v040002014" id="002014" >14</span>
 Joseph woke up, and taking the child and his mother by night, went into Egypt, <span class="verse" rel="v040002015" id="002015" >15</span>
 and there he stayed until Herod’s death. This was in fulfillment of these words of the Lord in the prophet, where he says – 
<p class="indent1"> ‘Out of Egypt I called my Son.’ 
<!-- 002 015 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v040002016" id="002016" >16</span>
 When Herod found out that the astrologers had tricked him, he flew into a rage. He sent and put to death all the boys in Bethlehem and the whole of that region, who were two years old or under, guided by the time which he had learned from the astrologers. <span class="verse" rel="v040002017" id="002017" >17</span>
 Then were fulfilled these words spoken in the prophet Jeremiah, where he says – 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v040002018" id="002018" >18</span>
 ‘A voice was heard in Ramah, 
<p class="indent2"> weeping and mourning loudly; 
<p class="indent1"> Rachel, weeping for her children, 
<p class="indent2"> refusing all comfort for they were dead.’ 
<!-- 002 018 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v040002019" id="002019" >19</span>
 But, on the death of Herod, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt, and said, <span class="verse" rel="v040002020" id="002020" >20</span>
 “Get up, take the child and his mother, and go into the Land of Israel, for those who sought to take the child’s life are dead.” <span class="verse" rel="v040002021" id="002021" >21</span>
 He woke up, and taking the child and his mother, went into the Land of Israel. <span class="verse" rel="v040002022" id="002022" >22</span>
 But, hearing that Archelaus had succeeded his father Herod as king of Judea, he was afraid to go back there; and having been warned in a dream, he went into the part of the country called Galilee. <span class="verse" rel="v040002023" id="002023" >23</span>
 There he settled in the town of Nazareth, in fulfillment of these words in the prophets – ‘He will be called a Nazarene.’ 
<h6>The Preparation</h6>
<!-- 003 023 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="003001">3</span> About that time John the Baptist first appeared, proclaiming in the wilderness of Judea: <span class="verse" rel="v040003002" id="003002" >2</span>
 “Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.” <span class="verse" rel="v040003003" id="003003" >3</span>
 John was the one who was spoken of in the prophet Isaiah, where he says – 
<p class="indent1"> ‘The voice of one crying aloud in the wilderness: 
<p class="indent1"> “Make ready the way of the Lord, 
<p class="indent1"> make his paths straight.”’ 
<!-- 003 003 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v040003004" id="003004" >4</span>
 John’s clothes were made of camels’ hair, with a leather strap around his waist, and his food was locusts and wild honey. <span class="verse" rel="v040003005" id="003005" >5</span>
 At that time Jerusalem, and all Judea, as well as the whole district of the Jordan, went out to him <span class="verse" rel="v040003006" id="003006" >6</span>
 and were baptized by him in the Jordan River, confessing their sins. 
<!-- 003 006 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v040003007" id="003007" >7</span>
 But when John saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to receive his baptism, he said to them, “You children of snakes! Who has prompted you to seek refuge from the coming judgment? <span class="verse" rel="v040003008" id="003008" >8</span>
 Let your life, then, prove your repentance; <span class="verse" rel="v040003009" id="003009" >9</span>
 and do not think that you can say among yourselves ‘Abraham is our ancestor,’ for I tell you that out of these stones God is able to raise descendants for Abraham! <span class="verse" rel="v040003010" id="003010" >10</span>
 Already the axe is lying at the root of the trees. Therefore every tree that fails to bear good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire. <span class="verse" rel="v040003011" id="003011" >11</span>
 I, indeed, baptize you with water to teach repentance; but he who is coming after me is more powerful than I, and I am not fit even to carry his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire. <span class="verse" rel="v040003012" id="003012" >12</span>
 His winnowing-fan is in his hand, and he will clear his threshing-floor, and store his grain in the barn, but the chaff he will burn with a fire that cannot be put out.” 
<!-- 003 012 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v040003013" id="003013" >13</span>
 Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan, to John, to be baptized by him. <span class="verse" rel="v040003014" id="003014" >14</span>
 But John tried to prevent him. 
<!-- 003 014 -->


<p> “I need to be baptized by you,” he said, “so why have you come to me?” 
<!-- 003 014 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v040003015" id="003015" >15</span>
<span class="woc"> “This is the way it should be for now,” </span>  Jesus answered,  <span class="woc"> “because we should do everything that God requires.” </span>  So John agreed. 
<!-- 003 015 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v040003016" id="003016" >16</span>
 After the baptism of Jesus, and just as he came up from the water, the heavens opened, and he saw the Spirit of God coming down like a dove and resting on him, <span class="verse" rel="v040003017" id="003017" >17</span>
 and from the heavens there came a voice which said, “This is my dearly loved son, who brings me great joy.” <p>
<!-- 004 017 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="004001">4</span> Then Jesus was led up into the wilderness by the Spirit to be tempted by the devil. <span class="verse" rel="v040004002" id="004002" >2</span>
 And, after he had fasted for forty days and forty nights, he became hungry. <span class="verse" rel="v040004003" id="004003" >3</span>
 The Tempter came to him, and said: 
<p class="indent1"> “If you are God’s Son, tell these stones to become loaves of bread.” <p>
<!-- 004 003 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v040004004" id="004004" >4</span>
 But Jesus answered,  <span class="woc"> “Scripture says – 
<p class="indent1"> ‘It is not on bread alone that a person is to live, but on every word that comes from the mouth of God.’” </span><p>
<!-- 004 004 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v040004005" id="004005" >5</span>
 Then the devil took him to the Holy City, and, placing him on the parapet of the temple, said to him, <span class="verse" rel="v040004006" id="004006" >6</span>
 “If you are God’s Son, throw yourself down, for scripture says – 
<p class="indent1"> ‘He will give his angels commands about you, 
<p class="indent1"> and on their hands they will lift you up, 
<p class="indent1"> so you do not even strike your foot against a stone.’” <p>
<!-- 004 006 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v040004007" id="004007" >7</span>
<span class="woc"> “Scripture also says,” </span>  answered Jesus, 
<p class="indent1"><span class="woc"> “‘You must not tempt the Lord your God.’” </span><p>
<!-- 004 007 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v040004008" id="004008" >8</span>
 The third time, the devil took Jesus to a very high mountain, and, showing him all the kingdoms of the world and their splendor, said to him: 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v040004009" id="004009" >9</span>
 “All these I will give you, if you will fall at my feet and worship me.” <p>
<!-- 004 009 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v040004010" id="004010" >10</span>
 Then Jesus said to him,  <span class="woc"> “Go away, Satan! For scripture says – 
<p class="indent1"> ‘You must worship the Lord your God, and worship him only.’” </span><p>
<!-- 004 010 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v040004011" id="004011" >11</span>
 Then the devil left him alone, and angels came and helped him. 
<h6>The Work in Galilee</h6>
<!-- 004 011 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v040004012" id="004012" >12</span>
 When Jesus heard that John had been arrested, he returned to Galilee. <span class="verse" rel="v040004013" id="004013" >13</span>
 Afterward, leaving Nazareth, he went and settled at Capernaum, which is by the side of the sea, within the borders of Zebulun and Naphtali; <span class="verse" rel="v040004014" id="004014" >14</span>
 in fulfillment of these words in the prophet Isaiah – 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v040004015" id="004015" >15</span>
 ‘The land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, 
<p class="indent1"> the land of the Road by the sea, and beyond the Jordan, 
<p class="indent2"> with Galilee of the Gentiles – 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v040004016" id="004016" >16</span>
 The people who were living in darkness 
<p class="indent2"> have seen a great light, 
<p class="indent1"> and, for those who were living in the shadow-land of death, 
<p class="indent2"> a light has dawned!’ <p>
<!-- 004 016 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v040004017" id="004017" >17</span>
 At that time Jesus began to proclaim – 
<p class="indent1"><span class="woc"> “Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.” </span>
<!-- 004 017 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v040004018" id="004018" >18</span>
 As Jesus was walking along the shore of the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers – Simon, also known as Peter, and his brother Andrew – casting a net into the sea; for they were fishermen.

 By the time that Jesus had finished speaking, the crowd was filled with amazement at his teaching. <span class="verse" rel="v040007029" id="007029" >29</span>
 For he taught them like one who had authority, and not like their teachers of the Law. <p>

<p><span class="chapter" id="008001">8</span> When Jesus had come down from the hill, great crowds followed him. <span class="verse" rel="v040008002" id="008002" >2</span>
 He saw a leper who came up, and bowed to the ground before him, and said, “Master, if only you are willing, you are able to make me clean.” <span class="verse" rel="v040008003" id="008003" >3</span>
 Stretching out his hand, Jesus touched him, saying as he did so,  <span class="woc"> “I am willing; become clean.” </span>  Instantly he was made clean from his leprosy; <span class="verse" rel="v040008004" id="008004" >4</span>
 and then Jesus said to him,  <span class="woc"> “Be careful not to say a word to anyone, but go and show yourself to the priest, and offer the gift directed by Moses, as evidence of your cure.” </span><span class="verse" rel="v040008005" id="008005" >5</span>
 After Jesus had entered Capernaum, a centurion in the Roman army came up to him, entreating his help. <span class="verse" rel="v040008006" id="008006" >6</span>
 “Sir,” he said, “my manservant is lying ill at my house with a stroke of paralysis, and is suffering terribly.” 
<!-- 008 006 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v040008007" id="008007" >7</span>
<span class="woc"> “I will come and cure him,” </span>  answered Jesus. <span class="verse" rel="v040008008" id="008008" >8</span>
 “Sir,” the centurion went on, “I am unworthy to receive you under my roof; but only speak, and my manservant will be cured. <span class="verse" rel="v040008009" id="008009" >9</span>
 For I myself am a man under the orders of others, with soldiers under me; and, if I say to one of them ‘Go,’ he goes, and to another ‘Come,’ he comes, and to my slave ‘Do this,’ he does it.” <span class="verse" rel="v040008010" id="008010" >10</span>
 Jesus was surprised to hear this, and said to those who were following him,  <span class="woc"> “Never I tell you, in any Israelite have I met with such faith as this! </span><span class="verse" rel="v040008011" id="008011" >11</span>
<span class="woc"> Yes, and many will come in from East and West and take their places beside Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven; </span><span class="verse" rel="v040008012" id="008012" >12</span>

 Then Jesus said to the centurion,  <span class="woc"> “Go now, and it will be according to your faith.” </span>  And the man was cured that very hour.

<p><span class="verse" rel="v040008014" id="008014" >14</span>
 When Jesus went into Peter’s house, he saw Peter’s mother-in-law prostrated with fever. <span class="verse" rel="v040008015" id="008015" >15</span>
 On his taking her hand, the fever left her, and she rose and began to take care of him. <span class="verse" rel="v040008016" id="008016" >16</span>
 In the evening the people brought to Jesus many who were possessed by demons; and he drove out the spirits with a word, and cured all who were ill, <span class="verse" rel="v040008017" id="008017" >17</span>
 in fulfillment of these words in the prophet Isaiah – ‘He took our infirmities on himself, and bore the burden of our diseases.’ 
<!-- 008 017 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v040008018" id="008018" >18</span>
 Seeing a crowd around him, Jesus gave orders to go across. <span class="verse" rel="v040008019" id="008019" >19</span>
 A teacher of the Law came up to him, and said, “Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go.” 
<!-- 008 019 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v040008020" id="008020" >20</span>
<span class="woc"> “Foxes have holes,” </span>  answered Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “and wild birds their nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head.” </span><span class="verse" rel="v040008021" id="008021" >21</span>
 “Master,” said another, who was a disciple, “let me first go and bury my father.” <span class="verse" rel="v040008022" id="008022" >22</span>
 But Jesus answered,  <span class="woc"> “Follow me, and leave the dead to bury their dead.” </span><span class="verse" rel="v040008023" id="008023" >23</span>
 Then he got into the boat, followed by his disciples. <span class="verse" rel="v040008024" id="008024" >24</span>
 Suddenly so great a storm came up on the sea, that the waves broke right over the boat. But Jesus was asleep; <span class="verse" rel="v040008025" id="008025" >25</span>
 and the disciples came and roused him. “Master,” they cried, “save us; we are lost!” 
<!-- 008 025 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v040008026" id="008026" >26</span>
<span class="woc"> “Why are you so timid?” </span>  he said.  <span class="woc"> “You of little faith!” </span>  Then Jesus rose and rebuked the winds and the sea, and a great calm followed. <span class="verse" rel="v040008027" id="008027" >27</span>
 The men were amazed, and exclaimed, “What kind of man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey him!” 
<!-- 008 027 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v040008028" id="008028" >28</span>
 On getting to the other side – the region of the Gadarenes – Jesus met two men who were possessed by demons, coming out of the tombs. They were so violent that no one was able to pass that way. <span class="verse" rel="v040008029" id="008029" >29</span>
 Suddenly they shrieked out, “What do you want with us, Son of God? Have you come here to torment us before our time?” <span class="verse" rel="v040008030" id="008030" >30</span>
 A long way off, there was a herd of many pigs, feeding; <span class="verse" rel="v040008031" id="008031" >31</span>
 and the foul spirits began begging Jesus, “If you drive us out, send us into the herd of pigs.” 
<!-- 008 031 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v040008032" id="008032" >32</span>
<span class="woc"> “Go,” </span>  he said. The spirits came out, and entered the pigs; and the whole herd rushed down the steep slope into the sea, and died in the water. <span class="verse" rel="v040008033" id="008033" >33</span>
 At this the men who tended them ran away and went to the town, carrying the news of all that had occurred, and of what had happened to the possessed men. <span class="verse" rel="v040008034" id="008034" >34</span>
 At the news the whole town went out to meet Jesus, and, when they saw him, they entreated him to go away from their region. 
<!-- 009 034 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="009001">9</span> Afterward Jesus got into a boat, and, crossing over, came to his own city. <span class="verse" rel="v040009002" id="009002" >2</span>
 There some people brought to him a paralyzed man on a bed. When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the man,  <span class="woc"> “Courage, child! Your sins are forgiven.” </span><span class="verse" rel="v040009003" id="009003" >3</span>
 Then some of the teachers of the Law said to themselves, “This man is blaspheming!” <span class="verse" rel="v040009004" id="009004" >4</span>
 Knowing their thoughts, Jesus exclaimed,  <span class="woc"> “Why do your cherish such wicked thoughts? </span><span class="verse" rel="v040009005" id="009005" >5</span>
<span class="woc"> Which, I ask, is the easier? – to say ‘Your sins are forgiven’? Or to say ‘Get up, and walk’? </span><span class="verse" rel="v040009006" id="009006" >6</span>
<span class="woc"> But to show you that the Son of Man has power on earth to forgive sins” </span>  – then he said to the paralyzed man –  <span class="woc"> “Get up, take up your bed, and return to your home.” </span><span class="verse" rel="v040009007" id="009007" >7</span>
 The man got up and went to his home. <span class="verse" rel="v040009008" id="009008" >8</span>
 When the crowd saw this, they were awe-struck, and praised God for giving such power to human beings. 
<!-- 009 008 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v040009009" id="009009" >9</span>
 As Jesus went along, he saw a man, called Matthew, sitting in the tax office, and said to him,  <span class="woc"> “Follow me.” </span>  Matthew got up and followed him. 
<!-- 009 009 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v040009010" id="009010" >10</span>
 And, later on, when he was having dinner in the house, a number of tax collectors and outcasts came in and took their places at the table with Jesus and his disciples. <span class="verse" rel="v040009011" id="009011" >11</span>
 When the Pharisees saw this, they said to his disciples, “Why does your teacher eat in the company of tax collectors and outcasts?” <span class="verse" rel="v040009012" id="009012" >12</span>
 On hearing this, Jesus said,  <span class="woc"> “It is not those who are healthy who need a doctor, but those who are ill. </span><span class="verse" rel="v040009013" id="009013" >13</span>
<span class="woc"> Go and learn what this means – ‘I desire mercy, and not sacrifice’; for I did not come to call the religious, but the outcast.” </span><span class="verse" rel="v040009014" id="009014" >14</span>
 Then John’s disciples came to Jesus, and asked, “Why do we and the Pharisees fast while your disciples do not?” <span class="verse" rel="v040009015" id="009015" >15</span>
 Jesus answered,  <span class="woc"> “Can the groom’s friends mourn as long as the groom is with them? But the days will come, when the groom will be taken away from them, and they will fast then. </span><span class="verse" rel="v040009016" id="009016" >16</span>
<span class="woc"> Nobody ever puts a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment; for such a patch tears away from the garment, and a worse tear is made. </span><span class="verse" rel="v040009017" id="009017" >17</span>
<span class="woc"> Nor do people put new wine into old wine-skins; for, if they do, the skins burst, and the wine runs out, and the skins are lost; but they put new wine into fresh skins, and so both are preserved.” </span>
<!-- 009 017 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v040009018" id="009018" >18</span>
 While Jesus was saying this, a synagogue leader came up and bowed to the ground before him. “My daughter,” he said, “has just died; but come and place your hand on her, and she will be restored to life.” <span class="verse" rel="v040009019" id="009019" >19</span>
 So Jesus rose and followed him, and his disciples went also. <span class="verse" rel="v040009020" id="009020" >20</span>
 But meanwhile a woman, who had been suffering from hemorrhage for twelve years, came up behind and touched the tassel of his cloak. <span class="verse" rel="v040009021" id="009021" >21</span>
 “If I only touch his cloak,” she said to herself, “I will get well.” <span class="verse" rel="v040009022" id="009022" >22</span>
 Turning and seeing her, Jesus said,  <span class="woc"> “Courage, daughter! Your faith has delivered you.” </span>  And at that very moment she became well. <span class="verse" rel="v040009023" id="009023" >23</span>
 When Jesus reached the leader’s house, seeing the flute players, and a number of people all in confusion, <span class="verse" rel="v040009024" id="009024" >24</span>
 he said,  <span class="woc"> “Go away, the little girl is not dead; she is asleep.” </span>  They began to laugh at him; <span class="verse" rel="v040009025" id="009025" >25</span>
 but, when the people had been sent out, Jesus went in, and took the little girl’s hand, and she rose. <span class="verse" rel="v040009026" id="009026" >26</span>
 The report of this spread through all that part of the country. 
<!-- 009 026 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v040009027" id="009027" >27</span>
 As Jesus was passing on from there, he was followed by two blind men, who kept calling out, “Take pity on us, Son of David!” <span class="verse" rel="v040009028" id="009028" >28</span>
 When he had gone indoors, the blind men came up to him; and Jesus asked them,  <span class="woc"> “Do you believe that I am able to do this?” </span>  “Yes, Master!” they answered. <span class="verse" rel="v040009029" id="009029" >29</span>
 Then he touched their eyes, and said,  <span class="woc"> “It will be according to your faith.” </span><span class="verse" rel="v040009030" id="009030" >30</span>
 Then their eyes were opened. Jesus sternly cautioned them.  <span class="woc"> “See that no one knows of it,” </span>  he said. <span class="verse" rel="v040009031" id="009031" >31</span>
 But the men went out, and spread the news about him through all that part of the country. <span class="verse" rel="v040009032" id="009032" >32</span>
 Just as they were going out, some people brought up to Jesus a dumb man who was possessed by a demon; <span class="verse" rel="v040009033" id="009033" >33</span>
 and, as soon as the demon had been driven out, the dumb man spoke. The people were astonished at this, and exclaimed, “Nothing like this has ever been seen in Israel!” <span class="verse" rel="v040009034" id="009034" >34</span>
 But the Pharisees said, “He drives out the demons by the help of the chief of the demons.” 
<!-- 009 034 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v040009035" id="009035" >35</span>
 Jesus went around all the towns and the villages, teaching in their synagogues, proclaiming the good news of the kingdom, and curing every kind of disease and every kind of sickness. <span class="verse" rel="v040009036" id="009036" >36</span>
 But, when he saw the crowds, his heart was moved with compassion for them, because they were distressed and harassed, like sheep without a shepherd; <span class="verse" rel="v040009037" id="009037" >37</span>
 and he said to his disciples,  <span class="woc"> “The harvest is abundant, but the laborers are few. </span><span class="verse" rel="v040009038" id="009038" >38</span>
<span class="woc"> Therefore pray to the owner of the harvest to send laborers to gather in his harvest.” </span>
<!-- 010 038 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="010001">10</span> Calling his twelve Disciples to him, Jesus gave them authority over foul spirits, so that they could drive them out, as well as the power of curing every kind of disease and every kind of sickness. <span class="verse" rel="v040010002" id="010002" >2</span>
 The names of the twelve apostles are these, First Simon, also known as Peter, and his brother Andrew; James the son of Zebedee, and his brother John; <span class="verse" rel="v040010003" id="010003" >3</span>
 Philip and Bartholomew; Thomas and Matthew the tax-gather; James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus; <span class="verse" rel="v040010004" id="010004" >4</span>

<!-- 010 004 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v040010005" id="010005" >5</span>
 These twelve Jesus sent out as his messengers, after giving them these instructions –  <span class="woc"> “Do not go to the Gentiles, nor enter any Samaritan town, </span><span class="verse" rel="v040010006" id="010006" >6</span>

<span class="woc"> If no one welcomes you, or listens to what you say, as you leave that house or that town, shake off its dust from your feet. </span><span class="verse" rel="v040010015" id="010015" >15</span>

<p><span class="chapter" id="011001">11</span> After Jesus had finished giving directions to his twelve Disciples, he left that place in order to teach and preach in their towns. 
<!-- 011 001 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v040011002" id="011002" >2</span>
 Now John had heard in prison what the Christ was doing, and he sent a message by his disciples, <span class="verse" rel="v040011003" id="011003" >3</span>
 and asked – “Are you ‘the coming one,’ or are we to look for someone else?” <span class="verse" rel="v040011004" id="011004" >4</span>
 The answer of Jesus to the question was –  <span class="woc"> “Go and report to John what you hear and see – </span><span class="verse" rel="v040011005" id="011005" >5</span>

<!-- 011 006 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v040011007" id="011007" >7</span>
 While John’s disciples were going back, Jesus began to say to the crowds with reference to John, <span class="verse" rel="v040011008" id="011008" >8</span>
<span class="woc"> “What did you go out into the wilderness to look at? A reed waving in the wind? If not, what did you go out to see? A man richly dressed? Why, those who wear rich things are to be found in the courts of kings! </span><span class="verse" rel="v040011009" id="011009" >9</span>
<span class="woc"> What, then, did you go for? To see a prophet? Yes, I tell you, and far more than a prophet. </span><span class="verse" rel="v040011010" id="011010" >10</span>
<span class="woc"> This is the man of whom scripture says – ‘I am sending my messenger ahead of you, and he will prepare your way before you.’ </span><span class="verse" rel="v040011011" id="011011" >11</span>
<span class="woc"> I tell you, no one born of a woman has yet appeared who is greater than John the Baptist; and yet the least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he. </span><span class="verse" rel="v040011012" id="011012" >12</span>
<span class="woc"> From the time of John the Baptist to this very hour, the kingdom of heaven has been taken by force, and people using force have been seizing it. </span><span class="verse" rel="v040011013" id="011013" >13</span>
<span class="woc"> For the teaching of all the prophets and of the Law continued until the time of John; </span><span class="verse" rel="v040011014" id="011014" >14</span>
<span class="woc"> and – if you are ready to accept it – John is himself the Elijah who was destined to come. </span><span class="verse" rel="v040011015" id="011015" >15</span>
<span class="woc"> If you have ears, listen. </span><span class="verse" rel="v040011016" id="011016" >16</span>
<span class="woc"> But to what will I compare the present generation? It is like little children sitting in the market-places and calling out to their playmates – </span><span class="verse" rel="v040011017" id="011017" >17</span>

<!-- 011 019 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v040011020" id="011020" >20</span>
 Then Jesus began to reproach the towns in which most of his miracles had been done, because they had not repented, <span class="verse" rel="v040011021" id="011021" >21</span>
<span class="woc"> “Alas for you, Chorazin! Alas for you, Bethsaida! For, if the miracles which were done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes. </span><span class="verse" rel="v040011022" id="011022" >22</span>
<span class="woc"> Yet, I tell you, the doom of Tyre and Sidon will be more bearable in the day of judgment than yours. </span><span class="verse" rel="v040011023" id="011023" >23</span>
<span class="woc"> And you, Capernaum! Will you exalt yourself to heaven? You will be flung down to Hades! For, if the miracles which have been done in you had been done in Sodom, it would have been standing to this day. </span><span class="verse" rel="v040011024" id="011024" >24</span>
<span class="woc"> Yet, I tell you, the doom of Sodom will be more bearable in the day of judgment than yours.” </span><span class="verse" rel="v040011025" id="011025" >25</span>
 At that same time Jesus uttered the words,  <span class="woc"> “I thank you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that, though you have hidden these things from the wise and learned, you have revealed them to the childlike! </span><span class="verse" rel="v040011026" id="011026" >26</span>
<span class="woc"> Yes, Father, I thank you that this has seemed good to you. </span><span class="verse" rel="v040011027" id="011027" >27</span>
<span class="woc"> Everything has been committed to me by my Father; nor does anyone fully know the Son, except the Father, or fully know the Father, except the Son and those to whom the Son may choose to reveal him. </span><span class="verse" rel="v040011028" id="011028" >28</span>
<span class="woc"> Come to me, all you who toil and are burdened, and I will give you rest! </span><span class="verse" rel="v040011029" id="011029" >29</span>
<span class="woc"> Take my yoke on you, and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble, and you will find rest for your souls; </span><span class="verse" rel="v040011030" id="011030" >30</span>
<span class="woc"> for my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.” </span>
<!-- 012 030 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="012001">12</span> About the same time Jesus walked through the cornfields one Sabbath. His disciples were hungry, and began to pick some ears of wheat and eat them. <span class="verse" rel="v040012002" id="012002" >2</span>
 But, when the Pharisees saw this, they said, “Look! Your disciples are doing what it is not allowable to do on a Sabbath!” 
<!-- 012 002 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v040012003" id="012003" >3</span>
<span class="woc"> “Haven’t you read,” </span>  replied Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “what David did, when he and his companions were hungry – </span><span class="verse" rel="v040012004" id="012004" >4</span>
<span class="woc"> how he went into the house of God, and how they ate the consecrated bread, through it was not allowable for him or his companions to eat it, but only for the priests? </span><span class="verse" rel="v040012005" id="012005" >5</span>
<span class="woc"> And haven’t you read in the law that, on the Sabbath, the priest in the Temple break the Sabbath and yet are not guilty? </span><span class="verse" rel="v040012006" id="012006" >6</span>
<span class="woc"> Here, however, I tell you, there is something greater than the Temple! </span><span class="verse" rel="v040012007" id="012007" >7</span>
<span class="woc"> Had you learned the meaning of the words – ‘I desire mercy, and not sacrifice,’ you would not have condemned those who are not guilty. </span><span class="verse" rel="v040012008" id="012008" >8</span>
<span class="woc"> For the Son of Man is lord of the Sabbath.” </span>
<!-- 012 008 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v040012009" id="012009" >9</span>
 Passing on, Jesus went into their synagogue, <span class="verse" rel="v040012010" id="012010" >10</span>
 and there he saw a man with a withered hand. Some people asked Jesus whether it was allowable to work a cure on the Sabbath – so that they might have a charge to bring against him. <span class="verse" rel="v040012011" id="012011" >11</span>
 But Jesus said to them,  <span class="woc"> “Which of you, if he had only one sheep, and that sheep fell into a pit on the Sabbath, would not lay hold of it and pull it out? </span><span class="verse" rel="v040012012" id="012012" >12</span>
<span class="woc"> How much more precious a person is than a sheep! Therefore it is allowable to do good on the Sabbath.” </span><span class="verse" rel="v040012013" id="012013" >13</span>
 Then he said to the man.  <span class="woc"> “Stretch out your hand.” </span>  The man stretched it out; and it had become as sound as the other. <span class="verse" rel="v040012014" id="012014" >14</span>
 On coming out, the Pharisees plotted against Jesus, to put him to death. 
<!-- 012 014 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v040012015" id="012015" >15</span>
 Jesus, however, became aware of it, and went away from that place. A number of people followed him, and he cured them all; <span class="verse" rel="v040012016" id="012016" >16</span>
 but he warned them not to make him known, <span class="verse" rel="v040012017" id="012017" >17</span>
 in fulfillment of these words in the prophet Isaiah – <span class="verse" rel="v040012018" id="012018" >18</span>
 ‘Here is my chosen servant, who I love and who pleases me! I will breathe my spirit on him, and he will announce a time of judgment to the Gentiles. <span class="verse" rel="v040012019" id="012019" >19</span>
 He will not contend, nor cry aloud, Neither will anyone hear his voice in the streets; <span class="verse" rel="v040012020" id="012020" >20</span>
 a bruised reed he will not break, and a smoldering wick he will not quench, until he has brought the judgment to a victorious issue, <span class="verse" rel="v040012021" id="012021" >21</span>
 and on his name will the Gentiles rest their hopes.’ 
<!-- 012 021 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v040012022" id="012022" >22</span>
 Then some people brought to Jesus a possessed man, who was blind and dumb; and he cured him, so that the man who had been dumb both talked and saw. <span class="verse" rel="v040012023" id="012023" >23</span>
 At this all the people were astounded. “Is it possible that this is the son of David?” they exclaimed. <span class="verse" rel="v040012024" id="012024" >24</span>
 But the Pharisees heard of it and said, “He drives out demons only by the help of Beelzebul the chief of the demons.” <span class="verse" rel="v040012025" id="012025" >25</span>
 Jesus, however, was aware of what was passing in their minds, and said to them,  <span class="woc"> “Any kingdom divided against itself becomes a desolation, and any town or household divided against itself will not last. </span><span class="verse" rel="v040012026" id="012026" >26</span>
<span class="woc"> So, if Satan drives Satan out, he must be divided against himself; and how, then, can his kingdom last? </span><span class="verse" rel="v040012027" id="012027" >27</span>
<span class="woc"> And, if it is by Beelzebul’s help that I drive out demons, by whose help is it that your own sons drive them out? Therefore they will themselves be your judges. </span><span class="verse" rel="v040012028" id="012028" >28</span>
<span class="woc"> But, if it is by the help of the Spirit of God that I drive out demons, then the kingdom of God must already be upon you. </span><span class="verse" rel="v040012029" id="012029" >29</span>
<span class="woc"> How, again, can anyone get into a strong man’s house and carry off his goods, without first securing him? Not until then will he plunder his house. </span><span class="verse" rel="v040012030" id="012030" >30</span>
<span class="woc"> Anyone who is not with me is against me, and the person who does not help me to gather is scattering. </span><span class="verse" rel="v040012031" id="012031" >31</span>
<span class="woc"> Therefore, I tell you, people will be forgiven every sin and slander; but slander against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven. </span><span class="verse" rel="v040012032" id="012032" >32</span>
<span class="woc"> Whoever speaks against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in the present age, or in the age to come. </span>

<p><span class="verse" rel="v040012033" id="012033" >33</span>
<span class="woc"> “You must assume either that both tree and fruit are good, or that both tree and fruit are worthless; since it is by its fruits that a tree is known. </span><span class="verse" rel="v040012034" id="012034" >34</span>
<span class="woc"> You children of snakes! How can you, evil as you are, say anything good? For what fills the heart will rise to the lips. </span><span class="verse" rel="v040012035" id="012035" >35</span>

<span class="woc"> At the judgment, the people of Nineveh will stand up with this generation, and will condemn it, because they repented at Jonah’s proclamation; and here is more than a Jonah! </span><span class="verse" rel="v040012042" id="012042" >42</span>
<span class="woc"> At the judgment the Queen of the South will rise up with the present generation, and will condemn it, because she came from the ends of the earth to listen to the wisdom of Solomon; and here is more than a Solomon! </span><span class="verse" rel="v040012043" id="012043" >43</span>
<span class="woc"> No sooner does a foul spirit leave a person, than it passes through places where there is no water, in search of rest, and does not find it. </span><span class="verse" rel="v040012044" id="012044" >44</span>
<span class="woc"> Then it says ‘I will go back to the home which I left’; but, on coming there, it finds it unoccupied, and swept, and put in order. </span><span class="verse" rel="v040012045" id="012045" >45</span>
<span class="woc"> Then it goes and brings with it seven other spirits more wicked than itself, and they go in, and make their home there; and the last state of that man proves to be worse than the first. So, too, will it be with this wicked generation.” </span>

<p><span class="verse" rel="v040012046" id="012046" >46</span>
 While he was still speaking to the crowds, his mother and brothers were standing outside, asking to speak to him. <span class="verse" rel="v040012047" id="012047" >47</span>
 Someone told him this, and Jesus replied, <span class="verse" rel="v040012048" id="012048" >48</span>
<span class="woc"> “Who is my mother? And who are my brothers?” </span><span class="verse" rel="v040012049" id="012049" >49</span>
 Then, stretching out his hands towards his disciples, he said,  <span class="woc"> “Here are my mother and my brothers! </span><span class="verse" rel="v040012050" id="012050" >50</span>

<p><span class="chapter" id="013001">13</span> That same day, when Jesus had left the house and was sitting by the sea, <span class="verse" rel="v040013002" id="013002" >2</span>
 such great crowds gathered around him, that he got into a boat, and sat in it, while all the people stood on the beach. <span class="verse" rel="v040013003" id="013003" >3</span>
 Then he told them many truths in parables.  <span class="woc"> “The sower,” </span>  he began,  <span class="woc"> “went out to sow; and, </span><span class="verse" rel="v040013004" id="013004" >4</span>

<span class="woc"> As soon as the sun had risen, it was scorched, and, because their roots were not deep enough, withered away. </span><span class="verse" rel="v040013007" id="013007" >7</span>
<span class="woc"> Some, again, fell into the brambles; but the brambles shot up and choked it. </span><span class="verse" rel="v040013008" id="013008" >8</span>
<span class="woc"> Some, however, fell on good soil, and yielded a return, sometimes one hundred, sometimes sixty, sometimes thirty fold. </span><span class="verse" rel="v040013009" id="013009" >9</span>

<p><span class="verse" rel="v040013011" id="013011" >11</span>
<span class="woc"> “To you,” </span>  answered Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “the knowledge of the hidden truths of the kingdom of heaven has been imparted, but not to those. </span><span class="verse" rel="v040013012" id="013012" >12</span>

<span class="woc"> That is why I speak to them in parables, because, though they have eyes, they do not see, and though they have ears, they do not hear or understand. </span><span class="verse" rel="v040013014" id="013014" >14</span>
<span class="woc"> In them is being fulfilled that prophecy of Isaiah which says –

<span class="woc"> “But blessed are your eyes, for they see, and your ears, for they hear; </span><span class="verse" rel="v040013017" id="013017" >17</span>

<span class="woc"> “Listen, then, yourselves to the parable of the sower. </span><span class="verse" rel="v040013019" id="013019" >19</span>
<span class="woc"> When anyone hears the message of the kingdom without understanding it, the evil one comes and snatches away what has been sown in their mind. This is the person meant by the seed which was sown along the path. </span><span class="verse" rel="v040013020" id="013020" >20</span>
<span class="woc"> By the seed which was sown on rocky places is meant the person who hears the message, and at once accepts it joyfully; </span><span class="verse" rel="v040013021" id="013021" >21</span>
<span class="woc"> but, as they have no root, they stand for only a short time; and, when trouble or persecution arises because of the message, they fall away at once. </span><span class="verse" rel="v040013022" id="013022" >22</span>
<span class="woc"> By the seed which was sown among the brambles is meant the person who hears the message, but the cares of life and the glamour of wealth completely choke the message, so that it gives no return. </span><span class="verse" rel="v040013023" id="013023" >23</span>
<span class="woc"> But by the seed which was sown on the good ground is meant the person who hears the message and understands it, and really yields a return, sometimes one hundred, sometimes sixty, sometimes thirty fold.” </span>
<!-- 013 023 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v040013024" id="013024" >24</span>
 Another parable which Jesus told them was this –  <span class="woc"> “The kingdom of heaven is compared to a person who sowed good seed in their field. </span><span class="verse" rel="v040013025" id="013025" >25</span>
<span class="woc"> But, while everyone was asleep, their enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat, and then went away. </span><span class="verse" rel="v040013026" id="013026" >26</span>
<span class="woc"> So, when the blades of corn shot up, and came into ear, the weeds made their appearance also. </span><span class="verse" rel="v040013027" id="013027" >27</span>
<span class="woc"> The owner’s servants came to them, and said ‘Was not it good seed that you sowed in your field? Where, then, do the weeds in it come from?’ </span><span class="verse" rel="v040013028" id="013028" >28</span>
<span class="woc"> ‘An enemy has done this,’ was the owner’s answer. ‘Do you wish us, then,’ they asked, ‘to go and gather them together?’ </span><span class="verse" rel="v040013029" id="013029" >29</span>
<span class="woc"> ‘No,’ said he, ‘because while you are pulling up the weeds you might uproot the wheat with them. </span><span class="verse" rel="v040013030" id="013030" >30</span>
<span class="woc"> Let both grow side by side until harvest; and then I will say to the reapers, Gather the weeds together first, and tie them in bundles for burning; but bring all the wheat into my barn.’” </span>
<!-- 013 030 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v040013031" id="013031" >31</span>
 Another parable which he told them was this –  <span class="woc"> “The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed, which a person took and sowed in his field. </span><span class="verse" rel="v040013032" id="013032" >32</span>
<span class="woc"> This seed is smaller than all other seeds, but, when it has grown up, it is larger than the herbs and becomes a tree, so that ‘the wild birds come and roost in its branches.’” </span>
<!-- 013 032 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v040013033" id="013033" >33</span>
 This was another parable which Jesus related –  <span class="woc"> “The kingdom of heaven is like some yeast which a woman took and covered up in three pecks of flour, until the whole had risen.” </span><span class="verse" rel="v040013034" id="013034" >34</span>
 Of all this Jesus spoke to the crowd in parables; indeed to them he used never to speak at all except in parables, <span class="verse" rel="v040013035" id="013035" >35</span>
 in fulfillment of these words in the prophet – ‘I will speak to them in parables; I will utter things kept secret since the foundation of the world.’ 
<!-- 013 035 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v040013036" id="013036" >36</span>
 Then Jesus left the crowd, and went into the house. Presently his disciples came to him, and said, “Explain to us the parable of the weeds in the field.” <span class="verse" rel="v040013037" id="013037" >37</span>
 He answered,  <span class="woc"> “The sower of the good seed is the Son of Man. </span><span class="verse" rel="v040013038" id="013038" >38</span>
<span class="woc"> The field is the world. By the good seed is meant the people of the kingdom. The weeds are the wicked, </span><span class="verse" rel="v040013039" id="013039" >39</span>
<span class="woc"> and the enemy who sowed them is the devil. The harvest time is the close of the age, and the reapers are angels. </span><span class="verse" rel="v040013040" id="013040" >40</span>
<span class="woc"> And, just as the weeds are gathered and burnt, so it will be at the close of the age. </span><span class="verse" rel="v040013041" id="013041" >41</span>
<span class="woc"> The Son of Man will send his angels, and they will gather from his kingdom all that hinders and those who live in sin, </span><span class="verse" rel="v040013042" id="013042" >42</span>
<span class="woc"> and will throw them into the blazing furnace, where there will be weeping and grinding of teeth. </span><span class="verse" rel="v040013043" id="013043" >43</span>
<span class="woc"> Then will the righteous shine, like the sun, in the kingdom of their Father. If you have ears, listen. </span>
<!-- 013 043 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v040013044" id="013044" >44</span>
<span class="woc"> “The kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hidden in a field, which a person found and hid again, and then, in their delight, went and sold everything that they had, and bought that field. </span>
<!-- 013 044 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v040013045" id="013045" >45</span>
<span class="woc"> “Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant in search of choice pearls. </span><span class="verse" rel="v040013046" id="013046" >46</span>
<span class="woc"> Finding one of great value, they went and sold everything that they had, and bought it. </span><span class="verse" rel="v040013047" id="013047" >47</span>
<span class="woc"> Or again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net which was cast into the sea, and caught fish of all kinds. </span><span class="verse" rel="v040013048" id="013048" >48</span>
<span class="woc"> When it was full, they hauled it up on the beach, and sat down and sorted the good fish into baskets, but threw the worthless ones away. </span><span class="verse" rel="v040013049" id="013049" >49</span>
<span class="woc"> So will it be at the close of the age. The angels will go out and separate the wicked from the righteous, </span><span class="verse" rel="v040013050" id="013050" >50</span>
<span class="woc"> and will throw them into the blazing furnace, where there will be weeping and grinding of teeth. </span>
<!-- 013 050 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v040013051" id="013051" >51</span>
<span class="woc"> “Have you understood all this?” </span>  Jesus asked. “Yes,” they answered. <span class="verse" rel="v040013052" id="013052" >52</span>
 Then he added,  <span class="woc"> “So every teacher of the Law, who has received instruction about the kingdom of heaven, is like a householder who produces from his stores things both new and old.” </span>
<!-- 013 052 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v040013053" id="013053" >53</span>
 When Jesus had finished these parables, he withdrew from that place. <span class="verse" rel="v040013054" id="013054" >54</span>
 Going to his own part of the country, he taught the people in their synagogue in such a manner that they were deeply impressed. “Where did he get this wisdom?” they said, “and the miracles? <span class="verse" rel="v040013055" id="013055" >55</span>
 Isn’t he the carpenter’s son? Isn’t his mother called Mary, and his brothers James, and Joseph, and Simon, and Judas? <span class="verse" rel="v040013056" id="013056" >56</span>
 And his sisters, too – are not they all living among us? Where, then did he get all this?” <span class="verse" rel="v040013057" id="013057" >57</span>
 These things proved a hindrance to their believing in him. But Jesus said,  <span class="woc"> “A prophet is not without honor, except in his own country and in his own house.” </span><span class="verse" rel="v040013058" id="013058" >58</span>
 He did not work many miracles there, because of their want of faith. 
<!-- 014 058 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="014001">14</span> At that time Prince Herod heard of the fame of Jesus, <span class="verse" rel="v040014002" id="014002" >2</span>
 and said to his attendants, “This must be John the Baptist; he must be risen from the dead, and that is why these miraculous powers are active in him.” <span class="verse" rel="v040014003" id="014003" >3</span>
 For Herod had arrested John, put him in chains, and shut him up in prison, to please Herodias, the wife of Herod’s brother Philip. <span class="verse" rel="v040014004" id="014004" >4</span>
 For John had said to him ‘You have no right to be living with her.’ <span class="verse" rel="v040014005" id="014005" >5</span>
 Yet, though Herod wanted to put him to death, he was afraid of the people, because they looked on John as a prophet. <span class="verse" rel="v040014006" id="014006" >6</span>
 But, when Herod’s birthday came, the daughter of Herodias danced before his guests, and so pleased Herod, <span class="verse" rel="v040014007" id="014007" >7</span>
 that he promised with an oath to give her whatever she asked. <span class="verse" rel="v040014008" id="014008" >8</span>
 Prompted by her mother, the girl said ‘Give me here, on a dish, the head of John the Baptist.’ <span class="verse" rel="v040014009" id="014009" >9</span>
 The king was distressed at this; yet, because of his oath and of the guests at his table, he ordered it to be given her. <span class="verse" rel="v040014010" id="014010" >10</span>
 He had John beheaded in the prison <span class="verse" rel="v040014011" id="014011" >11</span>
 and his head was brought on a dish and given to the girl, and she took it to her mother. <span class="verse" rel="v040014012" id="014012" >12</span>
 Then John’s disciples came, and took the body away, and buried it; and went and told Jesus. 
<!-- 014 012 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v040014013" id="014013" >13</span>
 When Jesus heard of it, he left privately in a boat to a lonely spot. The people, however, heard of his going, and followed him in crowds from the towns on foot. <span class="verse" rel="v040014014" id="014014" >14</span>
 On getting out of the boat, Jesus saw a great crowd, and his heart was moved at the sight of them; and he cured all the sick among them. <span class="verse" rel="v040014015" id="014015" >15</span>
 In the evening the disciples came up to him, and said, “This is a lonely spot, and the day is now far advanced; send the crowds away so that they can go to the villages, and buy themselves food.” <span class="verse" rel="v040014016" id="014016" >16</span>
 But Jesus said,  <span class="woc"> “They need not go away, it is for you to give them something to eat.” </span><span class="verse" rel="v040014017" id="014017" >17</span>
 “We have nothing here,” they said, “except five loaves and two fish.” 
<!-- 014 017 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v040014018" id="014018" >18</span>
<span class="woc"> “Bring them here to me,” </span>  was his reply. <span class="verse" rel="v040014019" id="014019" >19</span>
 Jesus ordered the people to take their seats on the grass; and, taking the five loaves and the two fish, he looked up to heaven, and said the blessing, and, after he had broken the loaves, gave them to his disciples; and they gave them to the crowds. <span class="verse" rel="v040014020" id="014020" >20</span>
 Everyone had sufficient to eat, and they picked up enough of the broken pieces that were left to fill twelve baskets. <span class="verse" rel="v040014021" id="014021" >21</span>
 The men who ate were about five thousand in number, without counting women and children. <span class="verse" rel="v040014022" id="014022" >22</span>
 Immediately afterward Jesus made the disciples get into a boat and cross over in advance of him, while he dismissed the crowds. <span class="verse" rel="v040014023" id="014023" >23</span>
 After dismissing the crowds, he went up the hill by himself to pray; and, when evening fell, he was there alone. <span class="verse" rel="v040014024" id="014024" >24</span>
 The boat was by this time some miles from shore, laboring in the waves, for the wind was against her. <span class="verse" rel="v040014025" id="014025" >25</span>
 Three hours after midnight, however, Jesus came towards the disciples, walking on the water. <span class="verse" rel="v040014026" id="014026" >26</span>
 But, when they saw him walking on the water, they were terrified. “It is a ghost,” they exclaimed, and cried out in fear. <span class="verse" rel="v040014027" id="014027" >27</span>
 But Jesus at once spoke to them.  <span class="woc"> “Courage!” </span>  he said,  <span class="woc"> “It is I; do not be afraid!” </span><span class="verse" rel="v040014028" id="014028" >28</span>
 “Master,” Peter exclaimed, “if it is you, tell me to come to you on the water.” <span class="verse" rel="v040014029" id="014029" >29</span>
 Jesus said,  <span class="woc"> “Come.” </span>  So Peter got down from the boat, and walked on the water, and went towards Jesus; <span class="verse" rel="v040014030" id="014030" >30</span>
 but, when he felt the wind, he was frightened, and, beginning to sink, cried out, “Master! Save me!” <span class="verse" rel="v040014031" id="014031" >31</span>
 Instantly Jesus stretched out his hand, and caught hold of him.  <span class="woc"> “You of little faith!” </span>  he said,  <span class="woc"> “Why did you falter?” </span><span class="verse" rel="v040014032" id="014032" >32</span>
 When they had got into the boat, the wind dropped. <span class="verse" rel="v040014033" id="014033" >33</span>
 But the men in the boat threw themselves on their faces before him, and said, “You are indeed God’s Son.” 
<!-- 014 033 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v040014034" id="014034" >34</span>
 When they had crossed over, they landed at Gennesaret. <span class="verse" rel="v040014035" id="014035" >35</span>
 But the people of that place, recognizing Jesus, sent out to the whole country around, and brought to him all who were ill, <span class="verse" rel="v040014036" id="014036" >36</span>
 begging him merely to let them touch the tassel of his cloak; and all who touched were made perfectly well. 
<!-- 015 036 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="015001">15</span> Then some Pharisees and teachers of the Law came to Jesus, and said, <span class="verse" rel="v040015002" id="015002" >2</span>
 “How is it that your disciples break the traditions of our ancestors? For they do not wash their hands when they eat food.” <span class="verse" rel="v040015003" id="015003" >3</span>
 His reply was,  <span class="woc"> “How is it that you on your side break God’s commandments out of respect for your own traditions? </span><span class="verse" rel="v040015004" id="015004" >4</span>
<span class="woc"> For God said – ‘Honor your father and mother,’ and ‘Anyone who abuses his father or mother shall suffer death,’ </span><span class="verse" rel="v040015005" id="015005" >5</span>
<span class="woc"> but you say ‘Whenever anyone says to his father or mother “Whatever of mine might have been of service to you is set apart for God,” </span><span class="verse" rel="v040015006" id="015006" >6</span>
<span class="woc"> he is in no way bound to honor his father.’ In this way you have nullified the words of God for the sake of your traditions. </span><span class="verse" rel="v040015007" id="015007" >7</span>
<span class="woc"> Hypocrites! It was well said by Isaiah when he prophesied about you – </span><span class="verse" rel="v040015008" id="015008" >8</span>
<span class="woc"> ‘This is a people that honor me with their lips, While their hearts are far removed from me; </span><span class="verse" rel="v040015009" id="015009" >9</span>
<span class="woc"> but vainly do they worship me, For they teach but human precepts.’” </span><span class="verse" rel="v040015010" id="015010" >10</span>
 Then Jesus called the people to him, and said,  <span class="woc"> “Listen, and mark my words. </span><span class="verse" rel="v040015011" id="015011" >11</span>
<span class="woc"> It is not what enters a person’s mouth that defiles them, but what comes out from their mouth – that does defile them!” </span><span class="verse" rel="v040015012" id="015012" >12</span>
 His disciples came up to him, and said, “Do you know that the Pharisees were shocked on hearing what you said?” 
<!-- 015 012 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v040015013" id="015013" >13</span>
<span class="woc"> “Every plant,” </span>  Jesus replied,  <span class="woc"> “that my heavenly Father has not planted will be rooted up. </span><span class="verse" rel="v040015014" id="015014" >14</span>
<span class="woc"> Leave them be; they are but blind guides; and, if one blind person guides another, both of them will fall into a ditch.” </span><span class="verse" rel="v040015015" id="015015" >15</span>
 Peter spoke up, “Explain this saying to us.” 
<!-- 015 015 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v040015016" id="015016" >16</span>
<span class="woc"> “What, do even you understand nothing yet?” </span>  Jesus exclaimed. <span class="verse" rel="v040015017" id="015017" >17</span>
<span class="woc"> “Don’t you see that whatever goes into the mouth passes into the stomach, and is afterward expelled? </span><span class="verse" rel="v040015018" id="015018" >18</span>
<span class="woc"> But the things that come out of the mouth proceed from the heart, and it is these that defile a person; </span><span class="verse" rel="v040015019" id="015019" >19</span>
<span class="woc"> for out of the heart proceed evil thoughts – murder, adultery, sexual immorality, theft, perjury, slander. </span><span class="verse" rel="v040015020" id="015020" >20</span>
<span class="woc"> These are the things that defile a person; but eating with unwashed hands does not defile a person.” </span>
<!-- 015 020 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v040015021" id="015021" >21</span>
 On going away from that place, Jesus went to the country around Tyre and Sidon. <span class="verse" rel="v040015022" id="015022" >22</span>
 There, a Canaanite woman of that district came out and began calling to Jesus, “Take pity on me, Master, Son of David; my daughter is grievously possessed by a demon.” <span class="verse" rel="v040015023" id="015023" >23</span>
 But Jesus did not answer her a word; and his disciples came up and begged him to send her away. “She keeps calling out after us,” they said. <span class="verse" rel="v040015024" id="015024" >24</span>
<span class="woc"> “I was not sent,” </span>  replied Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “to anyone except the lost sheep of Israel.” </span><span class="verse" rel="v040015025" id="015025" >25</span>
 But the woman came, and, bowing to the ground before him, said, “Master, help me.” 
<!-- 015 025 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v040015026" id="015026" >26</span>
<span class="woc"> “It is not fair,” </span>  replied Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “to take the children’s food and throw it to dogs.” </span><span class="verse" rel="v040015027" id="015027" >27</span>
 “Yes, Master,” she said, “for even dogs do feed on the scraps that fall from their owners’ table.” 
<!-- 015 027 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v040015028" id="015028" >28</span>
<span class="woc"> “Your faith is great,” </span>  was his reply to the woman,  <span class="woc"> “it will be as you wish!” </span>  And her daughter was cured that very hour. 
<!-- 015 028 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v040015029" id="015029" >29</span>
 On leaving that place, Jesus went to the shore of the Sea of Galilee; and then went up the hill, and sat down. <span class="verse" rel="v040015030" id="015030" >30</span>
 Great crowds of people came to him, bringing with them those who were lame, crippled, blind, or dumb, and many others. They put them down at his feet, and he cured them; <span class="verse" rel="v040015031" id="015031" >31</span>
 and the crowds were astonished, when they saw the dumb talking, the cripples made sound, the lame walking about, and the blind with their sight restored; and they praised the God of Israel. <span class="verse" rel="v040015032" id="015032" >32</span>
 Afterward Jesus called his disciples to him, and said,  <span class="woc"> “My heart is moved at the sight of all these people, for they have already been with me three days and they have nothing to eat; and I am unwilling to send them away hungry; they might faint on the way home.” </span><span class="verse" rel="v040015033" id="015033" >33</span>
 “Where can we,” his disciples asked, “in a lonely place find enough bread for such a crowd as this?” 
<!-- 015 033 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v040015034" id="015034" >34</span>
<span class="woc"> “How many loaves have you?” </span>  said Jesus. “Seven,” they answered, “and a few small fish.” <span class="verse" rel="v040015035" id="015035" >35</span>
 Telling the crowd to sit down on the ground, <span class="verse" rel="v040015036" id="015036" >36</span>
 Jesus took the seven loaves and the fish, and, after saying the thanksgiving, broke them, and gave them to the disciples; and the disciples gave them to the crowds. <span class="verse" rel="v040015037" id="015037" >37</span>
 Everyone had sufficient to eat, and they picked up seven baskets full of the broken pieces left. <span class="verse" rel="v040015038" id="015038" >38</span>
 The men who ate were four thousand in number without counting women and children. <span class="verse" rel="v040015039" id="015039" >39</span>
 Then, after dismissing the crowds, Jesus got into the boat, and went to the region of Magadan. 
<!-- 016 039 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="016001">16</span> Here the Pharisees and Sadducees came up, and, to test Jesus, requested him to show them some sign from the heavens. <span class="verse" rel="v040016002" id="016002" >2</span>
 But Jesus answered,  <span class="woc"> “In the evening you say ‘It will be fine weather, for the sky is as red as fire.’ </span><span class="verse" rel="v040016003" id="016003" >3</span>
<span class="woc"> But in the morning you say ‘Today it will be stormy, for the sky is as red as fire and threatening.’ You learn to read the sky; yet you are unable to read the signs of the times! </span><span class="verse" rel="v040016004" id="016004" >4</span>
<span class="woc"> A wicked and unfaithful generation is asking for a sign, but no sign will be given it except the sign of Jonah.” </span>  So he left them and went away. 
<!-- 016 004 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v040016005" id="016005" >5</span>
 Now the disciples had crossed to the opposite shore, and had forgotten to take any bread. <span class="verse" rel="v040016006" id="016006" >6</span>
 Presently Jesus said to them, “Take care and be on your guard against the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.” <span class="verse" rel="v040016007" id="016007" >7</span>
 But the disciples began talking among themselves about their having brought no bread. <span class="verse" rel="v040016008" id="016008" >8</span>
 On noticing this, Jesus said,  <span class="woc"> “Why are you talking among yourselves about your being short of bread, you of little faith? </span><span class="verse" rel="v040016009" id="016009" >9</span>
<span class="woc"> Don’t you yet see, nor remember the five loaves for the five thousand, and how many baskets you took away? </span><span class="verse" rel="v040016010" id="016010" >10</span>
<span class="woc"> Nor yet the seven loaves for the four thousand, and how many basketfuls you took away? </span><span class="verse" rel="v040016011" id="016011" >11</span>
<span class="woc"> How is it that you do not see that I was not speaking about bread? Be on your guard against the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.” </span><span class="verse" rel="v040016012" id="016012" >12</span>
 Then they understood that he had told them to be on their guard, not against the leaven of bread, but against the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees. 
<!-- 016 012 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v040016013" id="016013" >13</span>
 On coming into the region of Caesarea Philippi, Jesus asked his disciples this question –  <span class="woc"> “Who do people say that the Son of Man is?” </span><span class="verse" rel="v040016014" id="016014" >14</span>
 “Some say John the Baptist,” they answered, “Others, however, say that he is Elijah, while others again say Jeremiah, or one of the prophets.” 
<!-- 016 014 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v040016015" id="016015" >15</span>
<span class="woc"> “But you,” </span>  he said,  <span class="woc"> “who do you say that I am?” </span><span class="verse" rel="v040016016" id="016016" >16</span>
 To this Simon Peter answered, “You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.” 
<!-- 016 016 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v040016017" id="016017" >17</span>
<span class="woc"> “Blessed are you, Simon, Son of Jonah,” </span>  Jesus replied.  <span class="woc"> “For no human being has revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven. </span><span class="verse" rel="v040016018" id="016018" >18</span>
<span class="woc"> Yes, and I say to you, your name is ‘Peter’ – a Rock, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will not prevail over it. </span><span class="verse" rel="v040016019" id="016019" >19</span>
<span class="woc"> I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven. Whatever you forbid on earth will be held in heaven to be forbidden, and whatever you allow on earth will be held in heaven to be allowed.” </span><span class="verse" rel="v040016020" id="016020" >20</span>
 Then he charged his disciples not to tell anyone that he was the Christ. 
<!-- 016 020 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v040016021" id="016021" >21</span>
 At that time Jesus Christ began to explain to his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem, and undergo much suffering at the hands of the elders, and chief priests, and teachers of the Law, and be put to death, and rise on the third day. <span class="verse" rel="v040016022" id="016022" >22</span>
 But Peter took Jesus aside, and began to rebuke him. “Master,” he said, “please God that will never be your fate!” <span class="verse" rel="v040016023" id="016023" >23</span>
 Jesus, however, turning to Peter, said,  <span class="woc"> “Out of my way, Satan! You are a hindrance to me; for you look at things, not as God does, but as person does.” </span><span class="verse" rel="v040016024" id="016024" >24</span>
 Then Jesus said to his disciples,  <span class="woc"> “If anyone wishes to walk in my steps, they must renounce self, and take up their cross, and follow me. </span><span class="verse" rel="v040016025" id="016025" >25</span>
<span class="woc"> For whoever wishes to save his life will lose it, and whoever, for my sake, loses his life will find it. </span><span class="verse" rel="v040016026" id="016026" >26</span>
<span class="woc"> What good will it do a person to gain the whole world, if he forfeits his life? Or what will a person give that is of equal value with his life? </span><span class="verse" rel="v040016027" id="016027" >27</span>
<span class="woc"> For the Son of Man is to come in his Father’s glory, with his angels, and then he will give to everyone what his actions deserve. </span><span class="verse" rel="v040016028" id="016028" >28</span>
<span class="woc"> I tell you, some of those who are standing here will not know death until they have seen the Son of Man coming into his kingdom.” </span>
<!-- 017 028 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="017001">17</span> Six days later, Jesus took with him Peter, and the brothers James and John, and led them up a high mountain alone. <span class="verse" rel="v040017002" id="017002" >2</span>
 There his appearance was transformed before their eyes; his face shown like the sun, and his clothes became as white as the light. <span class="verse" rel="v040017003" id="017003" >3</span>
 All at once Moses and Elijah appeared to them, talking with Jesus. <span class="verse" rel="v040017004" id="017004" >4</span>
 “Master,” exclaimed Peter, interposing, “it is good to be here; if you wish, I will make three tents here, one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.” <span class="verse" rel="v040017005" id="017005" >5</span>
 While he was still speaking, a bright cloud enveloped them, and there was a voice from the cloud that said – “This is my dearly loved son, who brings me great joy; listen to him.” <span class="verse" rel="v040017006" id="017006" >6</span>
 The disciples, on hearing this, fell on their faces, greatly afraid. <span class="verse" rel="v040017007" id="017007" >7</span>
 But Jesus came and touched them, saying as he did so,  <span class="woc"> “Rise up, and do not be afraid.” </span><span class="verse" rel="v040017008" id="017008" >8</span>
 When they raised their eyes, they saw no one but Jesus himself alone. <span class="verse" rel="v040017009" id="017009" >9</span>
 As they were going down the mountain side, Jesus gave them this warning –  <span class="woc"> “Do not speak of this vision to anyone, until the Son of Man has risen from the dead.” </span><span class="verse" rel="v040017010" id="017010" >10</span>
 “How is it,” his disciples asked, “that our teachers of the Law say that Elijah has to come first?” 
<!-- 017 010 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v040017011" id="017011" >11</span>
<span class="woc"> “Elijah indeed does come,” </span>  Jesus replied,  <span class="woc"> “and will restore everything; </span><span class="verse" rel="v040017012" id="017012" >12</span>
<span class="woc"> and I tell you that Elijah has already come, and people have not recognized him, but have treated him just as they pleased. In the same way, too, the Son of Man is destined to undergo suffering at people’s hands.” </span><span class="verse" rel="v040017013" id="017013" >13</span>
 Then the disciples understood that he had spoken to them about John the Baptist. 
<!-- 017 013 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v040017014" id="017014" >14</span>
 When they came to the crowd, a man came up to Jesus, and, kneeling down before him, said, <span class="verse" rel="v040017015" id="017015" >15</span>
 “Master, take pity on my son, for he is epileptic and suffers terribly; indeed, he often falls into the fire and into the water; <span class="verse" rel="v040017016" id="017016" >16</span>
 I brought him to your disciples, but they could not cure him.” 
<!-- 017 016 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v040017017" id="017017" >17</span>
<span class="woc"> “Faithless and perverse generation!” </span>  Jesus exclaimed,  <span class="woc"> “how long must I be among you? How long must I have patience with you? Bring the boy here to me.” </span><span class="verse" rel="v040017018" id="017018" >18</span>
 Then Jesus rebuked the demon, and it came out of the boy; and he was cured from that very hour. <span class="verse" rel="v040017019" id="017019" >19</span>
 Afterward the disciples came up to Jesus, and asked him privately, “Why was it that we could not drive it out?” 
<!-- 017 019 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v040017020" id="017020" >20</span>
<span class="woc"> “Because you have so little faith!” </span>  he answered,  <span class="woc"> “For, I tell you, if your faith were only like a mustard seed, you could say to this mountain ‘Move from this place to that!’ and it would be moved; and nothing would be impossible to you.” </span><span class="verse" rel="v040017021" id="017021" >21</span>
<span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">       Some later manuscripts add: But this kind does not go out except by prayer and fasting. </span>
<!-- 017 021 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v040017022" id="017022" >22</span>
 While Jesus and his disciples were together in Galilee, he said to them,  <span class="woc"> “The Son of Man is destined to be betrayed into human hands, </span><span class="verse" rel="v040017023" id="017023" >23</span>
<span class="woc"> and they will put him to death, but on the third day he will rise.” </span>  The disciples were greatly distressed. 
<!-- 017 023 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v040017024" id="017024" >24</span>
 After they had reached Capernaum, the collectors of the Temple taz came up to Peter, and said, “Does not your Master pay the Temple tax?” 
<!-- 017 024 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v040017025" id="017025" >25</span>
 “Yes,” answered Peter. But, on going into the house, before he could speak, Jesus said,  <span class="woc"> “What do you think, Simon? From whom do earthly kings take taxes or tribute? From their sons, or from others?” </span><span class="verse" rel="v040017026" id="017026" >26</span>
 “From others,” answered Peter.  <span class="woc"> “Well then,” </span>  continued Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “their sons go free. </span><span class="verse" rel="v040017027" id="017027" >27</span>
<span class="woc"> Still, so we don’t offend them, go and throw a line into the sea; take the first fish that rises, open its mouth, and you will find in it a piece of money. Take that, and give it to the collectors for both of us.” </span>
<!-- 018 027 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="018001">18</span> On the same occasion the disciples came to Jesus, and asked him, “Who is really the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?” <span class="verse" rel="v040018002" id="018002" >2</span>
 Jesus called a little child to him, and placed it in the middle of them, and then said, <span class="verse" rel="v040018003" id="018003" >3</span>
<span class="woc"> “I tell you, unless you change and become like little children, you will not enter the kingdom of heaven at all. </span><span class="verse" rel="v040018004" id="018004" >4</span>
<span class="woc"> Therefore, anyone who will humble themselves like this child – that person will be the greatest in the kingdom of heaven. </span><span class="verse" rel="v040018005" id="018005" >5</span>
<span class="woc"> And anyone who, for the sake of my name, welcomes even one little child like this, is welcoming me. </span><span class="verse" rel="v040018006" id="018006" >6</span>
<span class="woc"> But, if anyone puts temptation in the way of one of these little ones who believe in me, it would be best for them to be sunk in the depths of the sea with a great millstone hung around their neck. </span><span class="verse" rel="v040018007" id="018007" >7</span>
<span class="woc"> Alas for the world because of such temptations! There cannot but be temptations but sorrow awaits the person who does the tempting! </span>

<p><span class="verse" rel="v040018008" id="018008" >8</span>
<span class="woc"> “If your hand or your foot causes you to sin, cut it off, and throw it away.

<span class="woc"> If your eye causes you to sin, take it out, and throw it away. It would be better for you to enter the life with only one eye, than to have both eyes and be thrown into the fires of Gehenna. </span><span class="verse" rel="v040018010" id="018010" >10</span>
<span class="woc"> Beware of despising one of these little ones, for in heaven, I tell you, their angels always see the face of my Father who is in heaven. </span><span class="verse" rel="v040018011" id="018011" >11</span>

 Then Peter came up, and said to Jesus, “Master, how often am I to forgive someone who wrongs me? As many as seven times?” <span class="verse" rel="v040018022" id="018022" >22</span>
 But Jesus answered,  <span class="woc"> “Not seven times, but seventy times seven. </span><span class="verse" rel="v040018023" id="018023" >23</span>
<span class="woc"> Therefore the kingdom of heaven may be compared to a king who wished to settle accounts with his servants. </span><span class="verse" rel="v040018024" id="018024" >24</span>

<span class="woc"> and, as he could not pay, his master ordered him to be sold towards the payment of the debt, together with his wife, and his children, and everything that he had. </span><span class="verse" rel="v040018026" id="018026" >26</span>
<span class="woc"> The servant threw himself down on the ground before him and said ‘Have patience with me, and I will pay you all.’ </span><span class="verse" rel="v040018027" id="018027" >27</span>
<span class="woc"> The master was moved with compassion; and he let him go, and forgave him the debt. </span><span class="verse" rel="v040018028" id="018028" >28</span>
<span class="woc"> But, on going out, that same servant came upon one of his fellow servants who owed him a hundred silver coins. Seizing him by the throat, he said ‘Pay what you owe me.’ </span><span class="verse" rel="v040018029" id="018029" >29</span>

<h6>The Journey to Jerusalem</h6>
<!-- 019 035 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="019001">19</span> At the conclusion of this teaching, Jesus withdrew from Galilee, and went into that district of Judea which is on the other side of the Jordan. <span class="verse" rel="v040019002" id="019002" >2</span>
 Great crowds followed him, and he cured them there. <span class="verse" rel="v040019003" id="019003" >3</span>
 Presently some Pharisees came up to him, and, to test him, said, “Has a man the right to divorce his wife for every cause?” 
<!-- 019 003 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v040019004" id="019004" >4</span>
<span class="woc"> “Haven’t you read,” </span>  replied Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “that at the beginning the Creator ‘made them male and female,’ </span><span class="verse" rel="v040019005" id="019005" >5</span>
<span class="woc"> and said – ‘For this reason a man will leave his father and mother, and be united to his wife, and the man and his wife will become one’? </span><span class="verse" rel="v040019006" id="019006" >6</span>
<span class="woc"> So that they are no longer two, but one. What God himself, then, has yoked together people must not separate.” </span><span class="verse" rel="v040019007" id="019007" >7</span>
 “Why, then,” they said, “did Moses direct that a man should serve his wife with a notice of separation and divorce her?” 
<!-- 019 007 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v040019008" id="019008" >8</span>
<span class="woc"> “Moses, owing to the hardness of your hearts,” </span>  answered Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “permitted you to divorce your wives, but that was not so at the beginning. </span><span class="verse" rel="v040019009" id="019009" >9</span>
<span class="woc"> But I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife, except on the ground of some serious sexual sin, and marries another woman, is guilty of adultery.” </span><span class="verse" rel="v040019010" id="019010" >10</span>
 “If that,” said the disciples, “is the position of a man with regard to his wife, it is better not to marry.” 
<!-- 019 010 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v040019011" id="019011" >11</span>
<span class="woc"> “It is not everyone,” </span>  replied Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “who can accept this teaching, but only those who have been enabled to do so. </span><span class="verse" rel="v040019012" id="019012" >12</span>
<span class="woc"> Some men are incapable of marriage because they were born that way, or have been made so by other people, while there are others who stay single for the sake of the kingdom of Heaven. Accept this if you can.” </span>

<p><span class="verse" rel="v040019013" id="019013" >13</span>
 Then some little children were brought to Jesus, for him to place his hands on them, and pray; but the disciples found fault with those who had brought them. <span class="verse" rel="v040019014" id="019014" >14</span>
 Jesus, however, said,  <span class="woc"> “Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for it is to the childlike that the kingdom of heaven belongs.” </span><span class="verse" rel="v040019015" id="019015" >15</span>
 So he placed his hands on them, and then went on his way.

<p><span class="verse" rel="v040019016" id="019016" >16</span>
 A man came up to Jesus, and said, “Teacher, what good thing must I do to obtain eternal life?” 
<!-- 019 016 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v040019017" id="019017" >17</span>
<span class="woc"> “Why ask me about goodness?” </span>  answered Jesus.  <span class="woc"> “There is but One who is good. If you want to enter the life, keep the commandments.” </span><span class="verse" rel="v040019018" id="019018" >18</span>
 “What commandments?” asked the man.  <span class="woc"> “These,” </span>  answered Jesus, –  <span class="woc"> “‘You must not kill. You must not commit adultery. You must not steal. You must not say what is false about others. </span><span class="verse" rel="v040019019" id="019019" >19</span>
<span class="woc"> Honor your father and your mother.’ And ‘You must love your neighbor as you love yourself.’” </span><span class="verse" rel="v040019020" id="019020" >20</span>
 “I have observed all these,” said the young man. “What is still wanting in me?” 
<!-- 019 020 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v040019021" id="019021" >21</span>
<span class="woc"> “If you wish to be perfect,” </span>  answered Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “go and sell your property, and give to the poor, and you will have wealth in heaven; then come and follow me.” </span><span class="verse" rel="v040019022" id="019022" >22</span>
 On hearing these words, the young man went away distressed, for he had great possessions. <span class="verse" rel="v040019023" id="019023" >23</span>
 At this, Jesus said to his disciples,  <span class="woc"> “I tell you that a rich person will find it hard to enter the kingdom of heaven! </span><span class="verse" rel="v040019024" id="019024" >24</span>
<span class="woc"> I say again, it is easier for a camel to get through a needle’s eye than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of heaven!” </span><span class="verse" rel="v040019025" id="019025" >25</span>
 On hearing this, the disciples exclaimed in great astonishment, “Who then can possibly be saved?” <span class="verse" rel="v040019026" id="019026" >26</span>
 But Jesus looked at them, and said,  <span class="woc"> “With people this is impossible, but with God everything is possible.” </span>  Then Peter turned and said to Jesus, <span class="verse" rel="v040019027" id="019027" >27</span>
 “But we – we left everything, and followed you; what, then, will we have?” 
<!-- 019 027 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v040019028" id="019028" >28</span>
<span class="woc"> “I tell you,” </span>  answered Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “that at the new creation, when the Son of Man takes his seat on his throne of glory, you who followed me will be seated on twelve thrones, as judges of the twelve tribes of Israel. </span><span class="verse" rel="v040019029" id="019029" >29</span>
<span class="woc"> Everyone who has left houses, or brothers, or sisters, or father, or mother, or children, or land, for my sake, will receive many times as much, and will gain eternal life. </span><span class="verse" rel="v040019030" id="019030" >30</span>
<span class="woc"> But many who are first now will then be last, and those who are last will be first. </span><span class="chapter" id="020001">20</span><span class="woc"> For the kingdom of heaven is like an employer who went out in the early morning to hire laborers for his vineyards. </span><span class="verse" rel="v040020002" id="020002" >2</span>
<span class="woc"> He agreed with the laborers to pay them the standard daily rate of two silver coins, and sent them into his vineyard. </span><span class="verse" rel="v040020003" id="020003" >3</span>
<span class="woc"> On going out again, about nine o’clock, he saw some others standing in the marketplace, doing nothing. </span><span class="verse" rel="v040020004" id="020004" >4</span>
<span class="woc"> ‘You also may go into my vineyard,’ he said, ‘and I will pay you what is fair.’ </span><span class="verse" rel="v040020005" id="020005" >5</span>
<span class="woc"> So they went. Going out again about midday and about three o’clock, he did as before. </span><span class="verse" rel="v040020006" id="020006" >6</span>
<span class="woc"> When he went out about five, he found some others standing there, and said to them ‘Why have you been standing here all day long, doing nothing?’ </span><span class="verse" rel="v040020007" id="020007" >7</span>
<span class="woc"> ‘Because no one has hired us,’ they answered. ‘You also may go into my vineyard,’ he said. </span><span class="verse" rel="v040020008" id="020008" >8</span>
<span class="woc"> In the evening the owner of the vineyard said to his steward ‘Call the laborers, and pay them their wages, beginning with the last, and ending with the first.’ </span><span class="verse" rel="v040020009" id="020009" >9</span>
<span class="woc"> Now when those who had been hired about five o’clock went up, they received two silver coins each. </span><span class="verse" rel="v040020010" id="020010" >10</span>
<span class="woc"> So, when the first went up, they thought that they would receive more, but they also received two silver coins each; </span><span class="verse" rel="v040020011" id="020011" >11</span>
<span class="woc"> at which they began to grumble at their employer. </span><span class="verse" rel="v040020012" id="020012" >12</span>
<span class="woc"> ‘These last,’ they said, ‘have done only one hour’s work, and yet you have put them on the same footing with us, who have borne the brunt of the day’s work, and the heat.’ </span><span class="verse" rel="v040020013" id="020013" >13</span>
<span class="woc"> ‘My friend,’ was his reply to one of them, ‘I am not treating you unfairly. Didn’t you agree with me for two silver coins? </span><span class="verse" rel="v040020014" id="020014" >14</span>
<span class="woc"> Take what belongs to you, and go. I choose to give to this last man the same as to you. </span><span class="verse" rel="v040020015" id="020015" >15</span>
<span class="woc"> Don’t I have the right to do as I choose with what is mine? Are you envious because I am generous?’ </span><span class="verse" rel="v040020016" id="020016" >16</span>
<span class="woc"> So those who are last will be first, and the first last.” </span>
<!-- 020 016 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v040020017" id="020017" >17</span>
 When Jesus was on the point of going up to Jerusalem, he gathered the twelve disciples around him by themselves, and said to them as they were on their way, <span class="verse" rel="v040020018" id="020018" >18</span>
<span class="woc"> “Listen! We are going up to Jerusalem; and there the Son of Man will be betrayed to the chief priests and teachers of the Law, and they will condemn him to death, </span><span class="verse" rel="v040020019" id="020019" >19</span>
<span class="woc"> and give him up to the Gentiles for them to mock, and to scourge, and to crucify; and on the third day he will rise.” </span>
<!-- 020 019 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v040020020" id="020020" >20</span>
 Then the mother of Zebedee’s sons came to him with her sons, bowing to the ground, and begging a favor. <span class="verse" rel="v040020021" id="020021" >21</span>
<span class="woc"> “What is it that you want?” </span>  he asked. “I want you to say,” she replied, “that in your kingdom these two sons of mine may sit, one on your right, and the other on your left.” 
<!-- 020 021 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v040020022" id="020022" >22</span>
<span class="woc"> “You do not know what you are asking,” </span>  was Jesus’ answer.  <span class="woc"> “Can you drink the cup that I am to drink?” </span>  “Yes,” they exclaimed, “we can.” 
<!-- 020 022 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v040020023" id="020023" >23</span>
<span class="woc"> “You will indeed drink my cup,” </span>  he said,  <span class="woc"> “but as to a seat at my right and at my left – that is not mine to give, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared by my Father.” </span><span class="verse" rel="v040020024" id="020024" >24</span>
 On hearing of this, the ten others were very indignant about the two brothers. <span class="verse" rel="v040020025" id="020025" >25</span>
 Jesus, however, called the ten to him, and said,  <span class="woc"> “The rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them as you know, and their high officials oppress them. </span><span class="verse" rel="v040020026" id="020026" >26</span>
<span class="woc"> Among you it is not so. </span><span class="verse" rel="v040020027" id="020027" >27</span>
<span class="woc"> No, whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant, and whoever wants to take the first place among you, must be your slave; </span><span class="verse" rel="v040020028" id="020028" >28</span>
<span class="woc"> just as the Son of Man came, not to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.” </span>
<!-- 020 028 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v040020029" id="020029" >29</span>
 As they were going out of Jericho, a great crowd followed him. <span class="verse" rel="v040020030" id="020030" >30</span>
 Two blind men who were sitting by the roadside, hearing that Jesus was passing, called out, “Take pity on us, Master, Son of David!” <span class="verse" rel="v040020031" id="020031" >31</span>
 The crowd told them to be quiet; but the men only called out the louder, “Take pity on us, Master, Son of David!” <span class="verse" rel="v040020032" id="020032" >32</span>
 Then Jesus stopped and called them.  <span class="woc"> “What do you want me to do for you?” </span>  he said. <span class="verse" rel="v040020033" id="020033" >33</span>
 “Master,” they replied, “we want our eyes to be opened.” <span class="verse" rel="v040020034" id="020034" >34</span>
 So Jesus, moved with compassion, touched their eyes, and immediately they recovered their sight, and followed him. 
<h6>The Last Days</h6>
<!-- 021 034 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="021001">21</span> When they had almost reached Jerusalem, having come as far as Bethphage, on the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent on two disciples. <span class="verse" rel="v040021002" id="021002" >2</span>
<span class="woc"> “Go to the village facing you,” </span>  he said,  <span class="woc"> “and you will immediately find an ass tethered, with a foal by her side; untie her, and lead her here for me. </span><span class="verse" rel="v040021003" id="021003" >3</span>
<span class="woc"> And, if anyone says anything to you, you are to say this – ‘The Master wants them’; and he will send them at once.” </span><span class="verse" rel="v040021004" id="021004" >4</span>
 This happened in fulfillment of these words in the prophet – <span class="verse" rel="v040021005" id="021005" >5</span>
 ‘Say to the people of Zion – “Your King is coming to you, gentle, and riding on an ass, and on the foal of a beast of burden.”’ 
<!-- 021 005 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v040021006" id="021006" >6</span>
 So the disciples went and did as Jesus had directed them. <span class="verse" rel="v040021007" id="021007" >7</span>
 They led the ass and the foal back, and, when they had put their cloaks on them, he seated himself on them. <span class="verse" rel="v040021008" id="021008" >8</span>
 The immense crowd of people spread their cloaks in the road, while some cut branches off the trees, and spread them on the road. <span class="verse" rel="v040021009" id="021009" >9</span>
 The crowds that led the way, as well as those that followed behind, kept shouting, “God save the Son of David! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord! God save him from on high!” <span class="verse" rel="v040021010" id="021010" >10</span>
 When he had entered Jerusalem, the whole city was stirred, and asked – <span class="verse" rel="v040021011" id="021011" >11</span>
 “Who is this?”, to which the crowd replied – “This is the prophet Jesus from Nazareth in Galilee.” 
<!-- 021 011 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v040021012" id="021012" >12</span>
 Jesus went into the Temple Courts, and drove out all those who were buying and selling there. He overturned the tables of the money changers, and the seats of the pigeon-dealers, <span class="verse" rel="v040021013" id="021013" >13</span>
 and said to them,  <span class="woc"> “Scripture says ‘My house will be called a house of prayer’; but you are making it a den of robbers.” </span><span class="verse" rel="v040021014" id="021014" >14</span>
 While he was still in the Temple Courts, some blind and some lame people came up to him, and he cured them. <span class="verse" rel="v040021015" id="021015" >15</span>
 But, when the chief priests and the teachers of the Law saw the wonderful things that Jesus did, and the boys who were calling out in the Temple Courts “God save the Son of David!”, they were indignant, <span class="verse" rel="v040021016" id="021016" >16</span>
 and said to him, “Do you hear what these boys are saying?” 
<!-- 021 016 -->


<p><span class="woc"> “Yes,” </span>  answered Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “but did you never read the words – ‘Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings you have called forth perfect praise’?” </span>
<!-- 021 016 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v040021017" id="021017" >17</span>
 Then he left them, and went out of the city to Bethany, and spent the night there. 
<!-- 021 017 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v040021018" id="021018" >18</span>
 The next morning, in returning to the city, Jesus became hungry; <span class="verse" rel="v040021019" id="021019" >19</span>
 and, noticing a solitary fig tree by the roadside, he went up to it, but found nothing on it but leaves. So he said to it,  <span class="woc"> “Never again will fruit be gathered off you.” </span>  And suddenly the fruit tree withered up. <span class="verse" rel="v040021020" id="021020" >20</span>
 When the disciples saw this, they exclaimed in astonishment, “How suddenly the fig tree withered up!” 
<!-- 021 020 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v040021021" id="021021" >21</span>
<span class="woc"> “I tell you,” </span>  replied Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “if you have faith, without ever a doubt, you will do what not only what has been done to the fig tree, but, even if you should say to this hill ‘Be lifted up and hurled into the sea!’ it would be done. </span><span class="verse" rel="v040021022" id="021022" >22</span>
<span class="woc"> And whatever you ask for in your prayers will, if you have faith, be granted you.” </span>
<!-- 021 022 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v040021023" id="021023" >23</span>
 After Jesus had come into the Temple Courts, the chief priests and the elders of the people came up to him as he was teaching, and said, “What authority have you to do these things? Who gave you this authority?” 
<!-- 021 023 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v040021024" id="021024" >24</span>
<span class="woc"> “I, too,” </span>  said Jesus in reply,  <span class="woc"> “will ask you one question; if you will give me an answer to it, then I, also, will tell you what authority I have to act as I do. </span><span class="verse" rel="v040021025" id="021025" >25</span>
<span class="woc"> It is about John’s baptism. What was its origin? Divine or human?” But they began arguing among themselves, “If we say ‘divine,’ he will say to us ‘Why then didn’t you believe him?’ </span><span class="verse" rel="v040021026" id="021026" >26</span>
 But if we say ‘human,’ we are afraid of the people, for everyone regards John as a prophet.” <span class="verse" rel="v040021027" id="021027" >27</span>
 So the answer they gave Jesus was – “We do not know.” 
<!-- 021 027 -->


<p><span class="woc"> “Then I,” </span>  he said,  <span class="woc"> “refuse to tell you what authority I have to do these things. </span><span class="verse" rel="v040021028" id="021028" >28</span>
<span class="woc"> What do you think of this? There was a man who had two sons. He went to the elder and said ‘Go and work in the vineyard today my son.’ </span><span class="verse" rel="v040021029" id="021029" >29</span>
<span class="woc"> ‘Yes, sir,’ he answered; but he did not go. </span><span class="verse" rel="v040021030" id="021030" >30</span>
<span class="woc"> Then the father went to the second son, and said the same. ‘I will not,’ he answered; but afterward he was sorry and went. </span><span class="verse" rel="v040021031" id="021031" >31</span>
<span class="woc"> Which of the two sons did as his father wished?” </span>  “The second,” they said.  <span class="woc"> “I tell you,” </span>  added Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “that tax collectors and prostitutes are going into the kingdom of God before you. </span><span class="verse" rel="v040021032" id="021032" >32</span>
<span class="woc"> For when John came to you, walking in the path of righteousness, you did not believe him, but tax collectors and prostitutes did; and yet you, though you saw this, even then were not sorry, nor did you believe him. </span>
<!-- 021 032 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v040021033" id="021033" >33</span>
<span class="woc"> “Listen to another parable. A man, who was an employer, once planted a vineyard, put a fence around it, dug a winepress in it, built a tower, and then let it out to tenants and went abroad. </span><span class="verse" rel="v040021034" id="021034" >34</span>
<span class="woc"> When the time for the grape harvest drew near, he sent his servants to the tenants, to receive his share of the produce. </span><span class="verse" rel="v040021035" id="021035" >35</span>
<span class="woc"> But the tenants seized his servants, beat one, killed another, and stoned a third. </span><span class="verse" rel="v040021036" id="021036" >36</span>
<span class="woc"> A second time the owner sent some servants, a larger number than before, and the tenants treated them in the same way. </span><span class="verse" rel="v040021037" id="021037" >37</span>
<span class="woc"> As a last resource he sent his son to them. ‘They will respect my son,’ he said. </span><span class="verse" rel="v040021038" id="021038" >38</span>
<span class="woc"> But the tenants, on seeing his son, said to each other ‘Here is the heir! Come, let us kill him, and get his inheritance.’ </span><span class="verse" rel="v040021039" id="021039" >39</span>
<span class="woc"> So they seized him, and threw him outside the vineyard, and killed him. </span><span class="verse" rel="v040021040" id="021040" >40</span>
<span class="woc"> Now, when the owner of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those tenants?” </span><span class="verse" rel="v040021041" id="021041" >41</span>
 “Miserable wretches!” they exclaimed, “he will put them to a miserable death, and he will let out the vineyard to other tenants, who will pay him his share of the produce at the proper times.” <span class="verse" rel="v040021042" id="021042" >42</span>
 Then Jesus added,  <span class="woc"> “Have you never read in the scriptures? – ‘The stone which the builders despised – has now itself become the cornerstone. This cornerstone has come from the Lord, and is marvelous in our eyes.’ </span><span class="verse" rel="v040021043" id="021043" >43</span>
<span class="woc"> That, I tell you, is why the kingdom of God will be taken from you, and given to a nation that does produce the fruit of the kingdom. </span><span class="verse" rel="v040021044" id="021044" >44</span>
<span class="woc"> Yes, and he who falls on this stone will be dashed to pieces, while anyone on whom it falls – it will scatter him as dust.” </span>
<!-- 021 044 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v040021045" id="021045" >45</span>
 After listening to these parables, the chief priests and the Pharisees saw that it was about them that he was speaking; <span class="verse" rel="v040021046" id="021046" >46</span>
 yet, although eager to arrest him, they were afraid of the crowds, who regarded him as a prophet. 
<!-- 022 046 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="022001">22</span> Once more Jesus spoke to them in parables. <span class="verse" rel="v040022002" id="022002" >2</span>
<span class="woc"> “The kingdom of heaven,” he said, “may be compared to a king who gave a banquet in honor of his son’s wedding. </span><span class="verse" rel="v040022003" id="022003" >3</span>
<span class="woc"> He sent his servants to call those who had been invited to the banquet, but they were unwilling to come. </span><span class="verse" rel="v040022004" id="022004" >4</span>
<span class="woc"> A second time he sent some servants, with orders to say to those who had been invited ‘I have prepared my meal, my cattle and fat beasts are killed and everything is ready; come to the banquet.’ </span><span class="verse" rel="v040022005" id="022005" >5</span>
<span class="woc"> They, however, took no notice, but went off, one to their farm, another to their business; </span><span class="verse" rel="v040022006" id="022006" >6</span>
<span class="woc"> while the rest, seizing his servants, ill-treated them and killed them. </span><span class="verse" rel="v040022007" id="022007" >7</span>
<span class="woc"> The king, in anger, sent his troops, put those murderers to death, and set their city on fire. </span><span class="verse" rel="v040022008" id="022008" >8</span>
<span class="woc"> Then he said to his servants ‘The banquet is prepared, but those who were invited were not worthy. </span><span class="verse" rel="v040022009" id="022009" >9</span>
<span class="woc"> So go to the cross-roads, and invite everyone you find to the banquet.’ </span><span class="verse" rel="v040022010" id="022010" >10</span>
<span class="woc"> The servants went out into the roads and collected all the people whom they found, whether bad or good; and the bridal-hall was filled with guests. </span><span class="verse" rel="v040022011" id="022011" >11</span>
<span class="woc"> But, when the king went in to see his guests, he noticed there a man who had not put on a wedding-robe. </span><span class="verse" rel="v040022012" id="022012" >12</span>
<span class="woc"> So he said to him ‘My friend, how is it that you came in here without a wedding-robe?’ The man was speechless. </span><span class="verse" rel="v040022013" id="022013" >13</span>
<span class="woc"> Then the king said to the attendants ‘Tie him hand and foot, and put him out into the darkness outside, where there will be weeping and grinding of teeth.’ </span><span class="verse" rel="v040022014" id="022014" >14</span>
<span class="woc"> For many are called, but few chosen.” </span>

<p><span class="verse" rel="v040022015" id="022015" >15</span>
 Then the Pharisees went away and conferred together as to how they might lay a trap for Jesus in the course of conversation. <span class="verse" rel="v040022016" id="022016" >16</span>
 They sent their disciples, with the Herodians, to say to him, “Teacher, we know that you are an honest person, and that you teach the way of God honestly, and are not afraid of anyone; for you pay no regard to a person’s position. <span class="verse" rel="v040022017" id="022017" >17</span>
 Tell us, then, what you think. Are we right in paying taxes to the Emperor, or not?” <span class="verse" rel="v040022018" id="022018" >18</span>
 Perceiving their malice, Jesus answered,  <span class="woc"> “Why are you testing me, you hypocrites? </span><span class="verse" rel="v040022019" id="022019" >19</span>
<span class="woc"> Show me the coin with which the tax is paid.” </span>  And, when they had brought him a coin, <span class="verse" rel="v040022020" id="022020" >20</span>
 he asked,  <span class="woc"> “Whose head and title are these?” </span><span class="verse" rel="v040022021" id="022021" >21</span>
 “The Emperor’s,” they answered, at which he said to them,  <span class="woc"> “Then pay to the Emperor what belongs to the Emperor, and to God what belongs to God.” </span><span class="verse" rel="v040022022" id="022022" >22</span>
 They wondered at his answer, and left him alone and went away.

<p><span class="verse" rel="v040022023" id="022023" >23</span>
 That same day some Sadducees came up to Jesus, maintaining that there is no resurrection. Their question was this, – <span class="verse" rel="v040022024" id="022024" >24</span>
 “Teacher, Moses said – ‘should a man die without children, the man’s brother will become the husband of the widow, and raise a family for his brother.’ <span class="verse" rel="v040022025" id="022025" >25</span>
 Now we had living among us seven brothers; of whom the eldest married and died, and, as he had no family, left his wife for his brother. <span class="verse" rel="v040022026" id="022026" >26</span>
 The same thing happened to the second and the third brothers, and indeed to all the seven. <span class="verse" rel="v040022027" id="022027" >27</span>
 The woman herself died last of all. <span class="verse" rel="v040022028" id="022028" >28</span>
 At the resurrection, then, whose wife will she be out of the seven, all of them having been married to her?” 
<!-- 022 028 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v040022029" id="022029" >29</span>
<span class="woc"> “Your mistake,” </span>  replied Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “is due to your ignorance of the scriptures, and of the power of God. </span><span class="verse" rel="v040022030" id="022030" >30</span>
<span class="woc"> For at the resurrection there is no marrying or being married, but all who rise are as angels in heaven. </span><span class="verse" rel="v040022031" id="022031" >31</span>
<span class="woc"> As to the resurrection of the dead, have you not read these words of God – </span><span class="verse" rel="v040022032" id="022032" >32</span>
<span class="woc"> ‘I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob’? He is not the God of dead people, but of living.” </span><span class="verse" rel="v040022033" id="022033" >33</span>
 The crowds, who had been listening to him, were greatly struck with his teaching.

<p><span class="verse" rel="v040022034" id="022034" >34</span>
 When the Pharisees heard that Jesus had silenced the Sadducees, they collected together. <span class="verse" rel="v040022035" id="022035" >35</span>
 Then one of them, a Student of the Law, to test him, asked this question – <span class="verse" rel="v040022036" id="022036" >36</span>
 “Teacher, what is the greatest commandment in the Law?” <span class="verse" rel="v040022037" id="022037" >37</span>
 His answer was,  <span class="woc"> “You must love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind. </span><span class="verse" rel="v040022038" id="022038" >38</span>
<span class="woc"> This is the great first commandment. </span><span class="verse" rel="v040022039" id="022039" >39</span>
<span class="woc"> The second, which is like it, is this – You must love your neighbor as you love yourself. </span><span class="verse" rel="v040022040" id="022040" >40</span>
<span class="woc"> On these two commandments hang all the Law and the prophets.” </span><span class="verse" rel="v040022041" id="022041" >41</span>
 Before the Pharisees separated, Jesus put this question to them – <span class="verse" rel="v040022042" id="022042" >42</span>
<span class="woc"> “What do you think about the Christ? Whose son is he?” </span>  “David’s,” they said. <span class="verse" rel="v040022043" id="022043" >43</span>
<span class="woc"> “How is it, then,” </span>  Jesus replied,  <span class="woc"> “that David, speaking under inspiration, calls him ‘lord,’ in the passage – </span><span class="verse" rel="v040022044" id="022044" >44</span>
<span class="woc"> ‘The Lord said to my Lord: Sit at my right hand, until I put your enemies beneath your feet’? </span><span class="verse" rel="v040022045" id="022045" >45</span>
<span class="woc"> Since, then, David calls him ‘lord,’ how is he David’s son?” </span><span class="verse" rel="v040022046" id="022046" >46</span>
 No one could say a word in answer; nor did anyone after that day venture to question him further. 
<!-- 023 046 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="023001">23</span> Then Jesus, speaking to the crowds and to his disciples, said, <span class="verse" rel="v040023002" id="023002" >2</span>
<span class="woc"> “The teachers of the Law and the Pharisees now occupy the chair of Moses. </span><span class="verse" rel="v040023003" id="023003" >3</span>

<p><span class="chapter" id="024001">24</span> Leaving the Temple Courts, Jesus was walking away, when his disciples came up to draw his attention to the Temple buildings. <span class="verse" rel="v040024002" id="024002" >2</span>

<span class="woc"> At that time, of two men on a farm one will be taken and one left; </span><span class="verse" rel="v040024041" id="024041" >41</span>
<span class="woc"> of two women grinding with a hand-mill one will be taken and one left. </span><span class="verse" rel="v040024042" id="024042" >42</span>
<span class="woc"> Therefore watch; for you cannot be sure on what day your Master is coming. </span><span class="verse" rel="v040024043" id="024043" >43</span>
<span class="woc"> But this you do know, that, had the owner of the house known at what time of night the thief was coming, they would have been on the watch, and would not have allowed their house to be broken into. </span><span class="verse" rel="v040024044" id="024044" >44</span>
<span class="woc"> Therefore, you must also prepare, since it is just when you are least expecting him that the Son of Man will come. </span><span class="verse" rel="v040024045" id="024045" >45</span>
<span class="woc"> Who, then is that trustworthy, careful servant, who has been placed by their master over his household, to give them their food at the proper time? </span><span class="verse" rel="v040024046" id="024046" >46</span>

<span class="woc"> But, should the servant be a bad servant, and say to themselves ‘My master is a long time in coming,’ </span><span class="verse" rel="v040024049" id="024049" >49</span>
<span class="woc"> and begin to beat their fellow servants, and eat and drink with drunkards, </span><span class="verse" rel="v040024050" id="024050" >50</span>
<span class="woc"> that servant’s master will come on a day when they do not expect him, and at an hour of which they are unaware, </span><span class="verse" rel="v040024051" id="024051" >51</span>
<span class="woc"> and will flog the servant severely, and assign them their place among the hypocrites, where there will be weeping and grinding of teeth. </span>

<p><span class="chapter" id="025001">25</span><span class="woc"> “Then the kingdom of heaven will be like ten bridesmaids who took their lamps and went out to meet the groom. </span><span class="verse" rel="v040025002" id="025002" >2</span>
<span class="woc"> Five of them were foolish, and five were prudent. </span><span class="verse" rel="v040025003" id="025003" >3</span>
<span class="woc"> The foolish ones took their lamps, but took no oil with them; </span><span class="verse" rel="v040025004" id="025004" >4</span>
<span class="woc"> while the prudent ones, besides taking their lamps, took oil in their jars. </span><span class="verse" rel="v040025005" id="025005" >5</span>
<span class="woc"> As the groom was late in coming, they all became drowsy, and slept. </span><span class="verse" rel="v040025006" id="025006" >6</span>
<span class="woc"> But at midnight a shout was raised – ‘The groom is coming! Come out to meet him!’ </span><span class="verse" rel="v040025007" id="025007" >7</span>
<span class="woc"> Then all the bridesmaids woke up and trimmed their lamps, </span><span class="verse" rel="v040025008" id="025008" >8</span>
<span class="woc"> and the foolish said to the prudent ‘Give us some of your oil; our lamps are going out.’ </span><span class="verse" rel="v040025009" id="025009" >9</span>
<span class="woc"> But the prudent ones answered ‘No, There may not be enough for you and for us. Go instead to those who sell it, and buy for yourselves.’ </span><span class="verse" rel="v040025010" id="025010" >10</span>
<span class="woc"> But while they were on their way to buy it, the groom came; and the bridesmaids who were ready went in with him to the banquet, and the door was shut. </span><span class="verse" rel="v040025011" id="025011" >11</span>
<span class="woc"> Afterward the other bridesmaids came. ‘Sir, Sir,’ they said, ‘open the door to us!’ </span><span class="verse" rel="v040025012" id="025012" >12</span>
<span class="woc"> But the groom answered ‘I tell you, I do not know you.’ </span><span class="verse" rel="v040025013" id="025013" >13</span>
<span class="woc"> Therefore watch, since you know neither the day nor the hour. </span>

<p><span class="verse" rel="v040025014" id="025014" >14</span>
<span class="woc"> “For it is as though a man, going on his travels, called his servants, and gave his property into their charge. </span><span class="verse" rel="v040025015" id="025015" >15</span>
<span class="woc"> He gave five bags of gold to one, two to another, and one bag to a third, in proportion to the ability of each. Then he set out on his travels. </span><span class="verse" rel="v040025016" id="025016" >16</span>
<span class="woc"> The servant who had received the five bags of gold went at once and traded with it, and made another five bags. </span><span class="verse" rel="v040025017" id="025017" >17</span>
<span class="woc"> So, too, the servant who had received the two bags of gold made another two bags. </span><span class="verse" rel="v040025018" id="025018" >18</span>
<span class="woc"> But the servant who had received the one bag went and dug a hole in the ground, and hid his master’s money. </span><span class="verse" rel="v040025019" id="025019" >19</span>
<span class="woc"> After a long time the master of those servants returned, and settled accounts with them. </span><span class="verse" rel="v040025020" id="025020" >20</span>
<span class="woc"> The servant who had received the five bags of gold came up and brought five bags more. ‘Sir,’ he said, ‘you entrusted me with five bags of gold; look, I have made another five bags!’ </span><span class="verse" rel="v040025021" id="025021" >21</span>
<span class="woc"> ‘Well done, good, trustworthy servant!’ said his master. ‘You have been trustworthy with a small sum; now I will place a large one in your hands; come and share your master’s joy!’ </span><span class="verse" rel="v040025022" id="025022" >22</span>
<span class="woc"> Then the one who had received the two bags of gold came up and said ‘Sir, you entrusted me with two bags pounds; look, I have made another two!’ </span><span class="verse" rel="v040025023" id="025023" >23</span>
<span class="woc"> ‘Well done, good, trustworthy servant!’ said his master. ‘You have been trustworthy with a small sum; now I will place a large one in your hands; come and share your master’s joy!’ </span><span class="verse" rel="v040025024" id="025024" >24</span>
<span class="woc"> The man who had received the single bag of gold came up, too, and said ‘Sir, I knew that you were a hard man; you reap where you have not sown, and gather up where you have not winnowed; </span><span class="verse" rel="v040025025" id="025025" >25</span>

<span class="woc"> ‘You lazy, worthless servant!’ was his master’s reply. ‘You knew that I reap where I have not sown, and gather up where I have not winnowed? </span><span class="verse" rel="v040025027" id="025027" >27</span>
<span class="woc"> Then you ought to have placed my money in the hands of bankers, and I, on my return, should have received my money, with interest. </span><span class="verse" rel="v040025028" id="025028" >28</span>
<span class="woc"> Therefore,’ he continued, ‘take away from him the one bag of gold, and give it to the one who has the ten bags. </span><span class="verse" rel="v040025029" id="025029" >29</span>
<span class="woc"> For, to him who has, more will be given, and he will have abundance; but, as for him who has nothing, even what he has will be taken away from him. </span><span class="verse" rel="v040025030" id="025030" >30</span>

<p><span class="chapter" id="026001">26</span> When Jesus had finished teaching all of that, he said to his disciples, <span class="verse" rel="v040026002" id="026002" >2</span>
<span class="woc"> “You know that in two days time the Festival of the Passover will be here; and that the Son of Man is to be given up to be crucified.” </span><span class="verse" rel="v040026003" id="026003" >3</span>
 Then the chief priests and the elders of the people met in the house of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas, <span class="verse" rel="v040026004" id="026004" >4</span>
 and plotted together to arrest Jesus by stealth and put him to death; <span class="verse" rel="v040026005" id="026005" >5</span>
 but they said, “Not during the Festival, or the people may riot.” 
<!-- 026 005 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v040026006" id="026006" >6</span>
 After Jesus had reached Bethany, and while he was in the house of Simon the leper, <span class="verse" rel="v040026007" id="026007" >7</span>
 a woman came up to him with an alabaster jar of very costly perfume, and poured the perfume on his head as he sat at the table. <span class="verse" rel="v040026008" id="026008" >8</span>
 The disciples were indignant at seeing this. “What is this waste for?” they exclaimed. <span class="verse" rel="v040026009" id="026009" >9</span>
 “It could have been sold for a large sum, and the money given to poor people.” 
<!-- 026 009 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v040026010" id="026010" >10</span>
<span class="woc"> “Why are you troubling the woman?” </span>  Jesus said, when he noticed it.  <span class="woc"> “For this is a beautiful deed that she has done to me. </span><span class="verse" rel="v040026011" id="026011" >11</span>
<span class="woc"> You always have the poor with you, but you will not always have me. </span><span class="verse" rel="v040026012" id="026012" >12</span>
<span class="woc"> In pouring this perfume on my body, she prepares me for my burial. </span><span class="verse" rel="v040026013" id="026013" >13</span>
<span class="woc"> I tell you, wherever, in the whole world, this good news is proclaimed, what this woman has done will be told in memory of her.” </span>

<p><span class="verse" rel="v040026014" id="026014" >14</span>
 It was then that one of the Twelve, named Judas Iscariot, made his way to the chief priests, <span class="verse" rel="v040026015" id="026015" >15</span>
 and said “What are you willing to give me, if I betray Jesus to you?” The Priests counted him out thirty pieces of silver as payment. <span class="verse" rel="v040026016" id="026016" >16</span>
 So from that time Judas looked for an opportunity to betray Jesus. 
<!-- 026 016 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v040026017" id="026017" >17</span>
 On the first day of the Festival of the unleavened bread, the disciples came up to Jesus, and said, “Where do you wish us to make preparations for you to eat the Passover?” 
<!-- 026 017 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v040026018" id="026018" >18</span>
<span class="woc"> “Go into the city to a certain man,” </span>  he answered,  <span class="woc"> “and say to him ‘The teacher says – My time is near. I will keep the Passover with my disciples at your house.’” </span><span class="verse" rel="v040026019" id="026019" >19</span>
 The disciples did as Jesus directed them, and prepared the Passover. <span class="verse" rel="v040026020" id="026020" >20</span>
 In the evening Jesus took his place with the twelve disciples, <span class="verse" rel="v040026021" id="026021" >21</span>
 and, while they were eating, he said,  <span class="woc"> “I tell you that one of you will betray me.” </span><span class="verse" rel="v040026022" id="026022" >22</span>
 In great grief they began to say to him, one by one, “Can it be I, Master?” 
<!-- 026 022 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v040026023" id="026023" >23</span>
<span class="woc"> “The one who dipped his bread beside me in the dish,” </span>  replied Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “is the one who will betray me. </span><span class="verse" rel="v040026024" id="026024" >24</span>
<span class="woc"> True, the Son of Man must go, as scripture says of him, yet alas for that man by whom the Son of Man is being betrayed! For that man it would be better never to have been born!” </span><span class="verse" rel="v040026025" id="026025" >25</span>
 Judas, who was betraying him, turned to him and said, “Can it be I, Rabbi?” 
<!-- 026 025 -->


<p><span class="woc"> “It is,” </span>  answered Jesus. 
<!-- 026 025 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v040026026" id="026026" >26</span>
 While they were eating, Jesus took some bread, and, after saying the blessing, broke it and, as he gave it to his disciples, said,  <span class="woc"> “Take it and eat it; this is my body.” </span><span class="verse" rel="v040026027" id="026027" >27</span>
 Then he took a cup, and, after saying the thanksgiving, gave it to them, with the words,  <span class="woc"> “Drink from it, all of you; </span><span class="verse" rel="v040026028" id="026028" >28</span>
<span class="woc"> for this is my covenant blood, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins. </span><span class="verse" rel="v040026029" id="026029" >29</span>
<span class="woc"> I tell you that I will never, after this, drink of this juice of the grape, until that day when I will drink it new with you in the kingdom of my Father.” </span>
<!-- 026 029 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v040026030" id="026030" >30</span>
 They then sang a hymn, and went out to the Mount of Olives. <span class="verse" rel="v040026031" id="026031" >31</span>
 Then Jesus said to them,  <span class="woc"> “Even you will all fall away from me tonight. Scripture says – ‘I will strike down the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.’ </span><span class="verse" rel="v040026032" id="026032" >32</span>
<span class="woc"> But, after I have risen, I will go before you into Galilee.” </span><span class="verse" rel="v040026033" id="026033" >33</span>
 “If everyone else falls away from you,” Peter answered, “I will never fall away!” 
<!-- 026 033 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v040026034" id="026034" >34</span>
<span class="woc"> “I tell you,” </span>  replied Jesus,  <span class="woc"> “that this very night, before the cock crows, you will disown me three times!” </span><span class="verse" rel="v040026035" id="026035" >35</span>
 “Even if I must die with you,” Peter exclaimed, “I will never disown you!” All the disciples spoke in the same way. 
<!-- 026 035 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v040026036" id="026036" >36</span>
 Then Jesus came with them to a garden called Gethsemane, and he said to his disciples,  <span class="woc"> “Sit down here while I go and pray over there.” </span><span class="verse" rel="v040026037" id="026037" >37</span>
 Taking with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, he began to show signs of sadness and deep distress of mind. <span class="verse" rel="v040026038" id="026038" >38</span>
<span class="woc"> “I am sad at heart,” </span>  he said,  <span class="woc"> “sad even to death; wait here and watch with me.” </span><span class="verse" rel="v040026039" id="026039" >39</span>
 Going on a little further, he threw himself on his face in prayer.  <span class="woc"> “My Father,” </span>  he said,  <span class="woc"> “if it is possible, let me be spared this cup; only, not as I will, but as you will.” </span><span class="verse" rel="v040026040" id="026040" >40</span>
 Then he came to his disciples, and found them asleep.  <span class="woc"> “What!” </span>  he said to Peter,  <span class="woc"> “could none of you watch with me for one hour? </span><span class="verse" rel="v040026041" id="026041" >41</span>
<span class="woc"> Watch and pray so that you don’t fall into temptation. True, the spirit is eager, but human nature is weak.” </span><span class="verse" rel="v040026042" id="026042" >42</span>
 Again, a second time, he went away, and prayed.  <span class="woc"> “My Father,” </span>  he said,  <span class="woc"> “if I cannot be spared this cup, but must drink it, your will be done!” </span><span class="verse" rel="v040026043" id="026043" >43</span>
 And coming back again he found them asleep, for their eyes were heavy. <span class="verse" rel="v040026044" id="026044" >44</span>
 So he left them, and went away again, and prayed a third time, again saying the same words. <span class="verse" rel="v040026045" id="026045" >45</span>
 Then he came to the disciples, and said,  <span class="woc"> “Sleep on now, and rest yourselves. Look – my time is close at hand, and the Son of Man is being betrayed into the hands of wicked people. </span><span class="verse" rel="v040026046" id="026046" >46</span>
<span class="woc"> Up, and let us be going. Look! My betrayer is close at hand.” </span><span class="verse" rel="v040026047" id="026047" >47</span>
 And, while he was still speaking, Judas, who was one of the Twelve, came in sight; and with him was a great crowd of people, with swords and clubs, sent from the chief priests and elders of the people. <span class="verse" rel="v040026048" id="026048" >48</span>
 Now the betrayer had arranged a signal with them. “The man whom I kiss,” he had said, “will be the one; arrest him.” <span class="verse" rel="v040026049" id="026049" >49</span>
 So he went up to Jesus at once, and exclaimed, “Welcome, Rabbi!” and kissed him; <span class="verse" rel="v040026050" id="026050" >50</span>
 at which Jesus said to him,  <span class="woc"> “Friend, do what you have come for.” </span>  The men went up, seized Jesus, and arrested him. <span class="verse" rel="v040026051" id="026051" >51</span>
 Suddenly one of those who were with Jesus stretched out his hand, and drew his sword, and striking the high priest’s servant, cut off his ear. <span class="verse" rel="v040026052" id="026052" >52</span>
<span class="woc"> “Sheathe your sword,” </span>  Jesus said,  <span class="woc"> “for all who draw the sword will be put to the sword. </span><span class="verse" rel="v040026053" id="026053" >53</span>
<span class="woc"> Do you think that I cannot ask my Father for help, when he would at once send to my aid more than twelve legions of angels? </span><span class="verse" rel="v040026054" id="026054" >54</span>
<span class="woc"> But in that case how would the scriptures be fulfilled, which say that this must be?” </span><span class="verse" rel="v040026055" id="026055" >55</span>
 Jesus at the same time said to the crowds,  <span class="woc"> “Have you come out, as if after a robber, with swords and clubs, to take me? I have sat teaching day after day in the Temple Courts, and yet you did not arrest me.” </span><span class="verse" rel="v040026056" id="026056" >56</span>
 The whole of this occurred in fulfillment of the prophetic scriptures. Then the disciples all forsook him and fled. 
<!-- 026 056 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v040026057" id="026057" >57</span>
 Those who had arrested Jesus took him to Caiaphas, the high priest, where the teachers of the Law and elders had assembled. <span class="verse" rel="v040026058" id="026058" >58</span>
 Peter followed him at a distance as far as the high priest’s courtyard, to see the outcome. <span class="verse" rel="v040026059" id="026059" >59</span>
 Meanwhile the chief priests and the whole of the High Council were trying to get such false evidence against Jesus, as would warrant putting him to death, <span class="verse" rel="v040026060" id="026060" >60</span>
 but they did not find any, although many came forward with false evidence. Later on, however, two men came forward and said, <span class="verse" rel="v040026061" id="026061" >61</span>
 “This man said ‘I am able to destroy the Temple of God, and to build it in three days.’” <span class="verse" rel="v040026062" id="026062" >62</span>
 Then the high priest stood up, and said to Jesus, “Have you no answer? What is this evidence which these men are giving against you?” <span class="verse" rel="v040026063" id="026063" >63</span>
 But Jesus remained silent. The high priest said to him, “I order you, by the living God, to tell us whether you are the Christ, the Son of God.” 
<!-- 026 063 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v040026064" id="026064" >64</span>
<span class="woc"> “It is true,” </span>  Jesus answered,  <span class="woc"> “Moreover I tell you all that hereafter you will see the Son of Man sitting on the right hand of the Almighty, and coming on the clouds of the heavens.” </span><span class="verse" rel="v040026065" id="026065" >65</span>
 Then the high priest tore his robes. “This is blasphemy!” he exclaimed. “Why do we want any more witnesses? You have just heard his blasphemy! <span class="verse" rel="v040026066" id="026066" >66</span>
 What is your decision?” They answered, “He deserves death.” <span class="verse" rel="v040026067" id="026067" >67</span>
 Then they spat in his face, and struck him, while others dealt blows at him, saying as they did so, <span class="verse" rel="v040026068" id="026068" >68</span>
 “Now play the prophet for us, you Christ! Who was it that struck you?” <span class="verse" rel="v040026069" id="026069" >69</span>
 Peter, meanwhile, was sitting outside in the courtyard; and a maidservant came up to him, and exclaimed, “Why, you were with Jesus the Galilean!” <span class="verse" rel="v040026070" id="026070" >70</span>
 But Peter denied it before them all. “I do not know what you mean,” he replied. <span class="verse" rel="v040026071" id="026071" >71</span>
 When he had gone out into the gateway, another maid saw him, and said to those who were there, “This man was with Jesus of Nazareth!” <span class="verse" rel="v040026072" id="026072" >72</span>
 Again he denied it with an oath, “I do not know the man!” <span class="verse" rel="v040026073" id="026073" >73</span>
 But soon afterward those who were standing by came up and said to Peter, “You also are certainly one of them; why, even your way of speaking proves it!” <span class="verse" rel="v040026074" id="026074" >74</span>
 Then Peter said, “I swear that I do not know the man! May God punish me if I am lying!” At that moment a cock crowed; <span class="verse" rel="v040026075" id="026075" >75</span>
 and Peter remembered the words which Jesus had said –  <span class="woc"> ‘Before a cock has crowed, you will disown me three times’; </span>  and he went outside, and wept bitterly. 
<!-- 027 075 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="027001">27</span> At daybreak all the chief priests and the elders of the people consulted together against Jesus, to bring about his death. <span class="verse" rel="v040027002" id="027002" >2</span>
 They put him in chains and led him away, and gave him up to the Roman Governor, Pilate. <span class="verse" rel="v040027003" id="027003" >3</span>
 Then Judas, who betrayed him, seeing that Jesus was condemned, repented of what he had done, and returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders. <span class="verse" rel="v040027004" id="027004" >4</span>
 “I did wrong in betraying a good man to his death,” he said. “What has that to do with us?” they replied. “You must see to that yourself.” <span class="verse" rel="v040027005" id="027005" >5</span>
 Judas flung down the pieces of silver in the Temple, and left; and went away and hanged himself. <span class="verse" rel="v040027006" id="027006" >6</span>
 The chief priests took the pieces of silver, but they said, “We must not put them into the Temple treasury, because they are blood-money.” <span class="verse" rel="v040027007" id="027007" >7</span>
 So, after consultation, they used it to buy the ‘Potter’s Field’ as a burial ground for foreigners, <span class="verse" rel="v040027008" id="027008" >8</span>
 and that is why that field is called the ‘Field of Blood’ to this very day. <span class="verse" rel="v040027009" id="027009" >9</span>
 Then it was that these words spoken by the prophet Jeremiah were fulfilled – ‘They took the thirty pieces of silver, the price set on him by the people of Israel, <span class="verse" rel="v040027010" id="027010" >10</span>
 and gave them for the potter’s field, as the Lord commanded me.’ <span class="verse" rel="v040027011" id="027011" >11</span>
 Meanwhile Jesus was brought before the Roman Governor. “Are you the king of the Jews?” asked the Governor.  <span class="woc"> “It is true,” </span>  answered Jesus. <span class="verse" rel="v040027012" id="027012" >12</span>
 While charges were being brought against him by the chief priests and elders, Jesus made no reply. <span class="verse" rel="v040027013" id="027013" >13</span>
 Then Pilate said to him, “Don’t you hear how many accusations they are making against you?” <span class="verse" rel="v040027014" id="027014" >14</span>
 Yet Jesus made no reply – not even a single word; at which the Governor was greatly astonished. <span class="verse" rel="v040027015" id="027015" >15</span>
 Now, at the feast, the Governor was accustomed to grant the people the release of any one prisoner whom they might choose. <span class="verse" rel="v040027016" id="027016" >16</span>
 At that time they had a notorious prisoner called Barabbas. <span class="verse" rel="v040027017" id="027017" >17</span>
 So, when the people had collected, Pilate said to them, “Which do you wish me to release for you? Barabbas? Or Jesus who is called ‘Christ’?” <span class="verse" rel="v040027018" id="027018" >18</span>
 For he knew that it was out of jealousy that they had given Jesus up to him. <span class="verse" rel="v040027019" id="027019" >19</span>
 While he was still on the Bench, his wife sent this message to him – “Do not have anything to do with that good man, for I have been very much troubled today in a dream because of him.” <span class="verse" rel="v040027020" id="027020" >20</span>
 But the chief priests and elders persuaded the crowds to ask for Barabbas, and to kill Jesus. <span class="verse" rel="v040027021" id="027021" >21</span>
 The Governor, however, said to them, “Which of these two do you wish me to release for you?” 
<!-- 027 021 -->


<p> “Barabbas,” they answered. <span class="verse" rel="v040027022" id="027022" >22</span>
 “What then,” Pilate asked, “should I do with Jesus who is called ‘Christ?’” “Crucify him,” they all replied. <span class="verse" rel="v040027023" id="027023" >23</span>
 “Why, what harm has he done?” he asked. But they kept shouting furiously, “Crucify him!” <span class="verse" rel="v040027024" id="027024" >24</span>
 When Pilate saw that his efforts were unavailing, but that, on the contrary, a riot was beginning, he took some water, and washed his hands in the sight of the crowd, saying as he did so, “I am not answerable for this bloodshed; you must see to it yourselves.” <span class="verse" rel="v040027025" id="027025" >25</span>
 And all the people answered, “His blood be on our heads and on our children’s!” <span class="verse" rel="v040027026" id="027026" >26</span>
 Then Pilate released Barabbas to them, but Jesus he had scourged, and gave him up to be crucified. 
<!-- 027 026 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v040027027" id="027027" >27</span>
 After that, the Governor’s soldiers took Jesus with them into the Government house, and gathered the whole garrison around him. <span class="verse" rel="v040027028" id="027028" >28</span>
 They stripped him, and put on him a red military cloak, <span class="verse" rel="v040027029" id="027029" >29</span>
 and having twisted some thorns into a crown, put it on his head, and a rod in his right hand, and then, going down on their knees before him, they mocked him. “Long life to you, king of the Jews!” they said. <span class="verse" rel="v040027030" id="027030" >30</span>
 They spat at him and, taking the rod, kept striking him on the head; <span class="verse" rel="v040027031" id="027031" >31</span>
 and, when they had left off mocking him, they took off the military cloak, and put his own clothes on him, and led him away to be crucified. 
<!-- 027 031 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v040027032" id="027032" >32</span>
 As they were on their way out, they came upon a man from Cyrene called Simon, and they compelled him to go with them to carry the cross. <span class="verse" rel="v040027033" id="027033" >33</span>
 On reaching a place named Golgotha (a place named from its likeness to a skull), <span class="verse" rel="v040027034" id="027034" >34</span>
 they gave him some wine to drink which had been mixed with gall; but after tasting it, Jesus refused to drink it. <span class="verse" rel="v040027035" id="027035" >35</span>
 When they had crucified him, they divided his clothes among them by casting lots. <span class="verse" rel="v040027036" id="027036" >36</span>
 Then they sat down, and kept watch over him there. <span class="verse" rel="v040027037" id="027037" >37</span>
 Above his head they fixed the accusation against him written out – ‘THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.’ <span class="verse" rel="v040027038" id="027038" >38</span>
 At the same time two robbers were crucified with him, one on the right, the other on the left. <span class="verse" rel="v040027039" id="027039" >39</span>
 The passers-by railed at him, shaking their heads as they said, <span class="verse" rel="v040027040" id="027040" >40</span>
 “You who would ‘destroy the Temple and build one in three days,’ save yourself! If you are God’s Son, come down from the cross!” <span class="verse" rel="v040027041" id="027041" >41</span>
 In the same way the chief priests, with the Teachers of the Law and elders, said in mockery, <span class="verse" rel="v040027042" id="027042" >42</span>
 “He saved others, but he cannot save himself! He is the ‘king of Israel’! Why doesn’t he come down from the cross now, then we will believe in him. <span class="verse" rel="v040027043" id="027043" >43</span>
 He has trusted in God; if God wants him, let him deliver him now; for he said ‘I am God’s Son.’” <span class="verse" rel="v040027044" id="027044" >44</span>
 Even the robbers, who were crucified with him, insulted him in the same way. <span class="verse" rel="v040027045" id="027045" >45</span>
 After midday a darkness came over all the country, lasting until three in the afternoon. <span class="verse" rel="v040027046" id="027046" >46</span>
 About three Jesus called out loudly,  <span class="woc"> “Eloi, Eloi, lema sabacthani” </span>  – that is to say,  <span class="woc"> ‘My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?’ </span><span class="verse" rel="v040027047" id="027047" >47</span>
 Some of those standing by heard this, and said, “The man is calling for Elijah!” <span class="verse" rel="v040027048" id="027048" >48</span>
 One of them immediately ran and took a sponge, and, filling it with common wine, put it on the end of a rod, and offered it to him to drink. <span class="verse" rel="v040027049" id="027049" >49</span>
 But the rest said, “Wait and let us see if Elijah is coming to save him.” <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">        Some later manuscripts add: However another man took a spear, and pierced his side; and water and blood flowed from it. </span><span class="verse" rel="v040027050" id="027050" >50</span>
 But Jesus, uttering another loud cry, gave up his spirit. <span class="verse" rel="v040027051" id="027051" >51</span>
 Suddenly the Temple curtain was torn in two from top to bottom, the earth shook, the rocks were torn asunder, <span class="verse" rel="v040027052" id="027052" >52</span>
 the tombs opened, and the bodies of many of God’s people who had fallen asleep rose, <span class="verse" rel="v040027053" id="027053" >53</span>
 and they, leaving their tombs, went, after the resurrection of Jesus, into the Holy City, and appeared to many people. <span class="verse" rel="v040027054" id="027054" >54</span>
 The Roman centurion, and the men with him who were watching Jesus, on seeing the earthquake and all that was happening, became greatly frightened and exclaimed, “This must indeed have been God’s Son!” <span class="verse" rel="v040027055" id="027055" >55</span>
 There were many women there, watching from a distance, who had accompanied Jesus from Galilee and had been attending on him. <span class="verse" rel="v040027056" id="027056" >56</span>
 Among them were Mary of Magdala, Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of Zebedee’s sons. 
<!-- 027 056 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v040027057" id="027057" >57</span>
 When evening had fallen, there came a rich man from  Arimathea, named Joseph, who had himself become a disciple of Jesus. <span class="verse" rel="v040027058" id="027058" >58</span>
 He went to see Pilate, and asked for the body of Jesus. Pilate ordered it to be given him. <span class="verse" rel="v040027059" id="027059" >59</span>
 So Joseph took the body, and wrapped it in a clean linen sheet, <span class="verse" rel="v040027060" id="027060" >60</span>
 and laid it in his newly made tomb which he had cut in the rock; and, before he left, he rolled a great stone against the entrance of the tomb. <span class="verse" rel="v040027061" id="027061" >61</span>
 Mary of Magdala and the other Mary remained behind, sitting in front of the grave. 
<!-- 027 061 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v040027062" id="027062" >62</span>
 The next day – that is, the day following the Preparation-day – the chief priests and Pharisees came in a body to Pilate, and said, <span class="verse" rel="v040027063" id="027063" >63</span>
 “Sir, we remember that, during his lifetime, that impostor said  <span class="woc"> ‘I will rise after three days.’ </span><span class="verse" rel="v040027064" id="027064" >64</span>
 So order the tomb to be made secure until the third day. Otherwise his disciples may come and steal him, and then say to the people ‘He has risen from the dead,’ when the latest imposture will be worse than the first.” 
<!-- 027 064 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v040027065" id="027065" >65</span>
 “You may have a guard,” was Pilate’s reply. “Go and make the tomb as secure as you can.” <span class="verse" rel="v040027066" id="027066" >66</span>
 So they went and made the tomb secure, by sealing the stone, in presence of the guard. 
<h6>The Risen Life</h6>
<!-- 028 066 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="028001">28</span> After the Sabbath, as the first day of the week began to dawn, Mary of Magdala and the other Mary had gone to look at the grave, <span class="verse" rel="v040028002" id="028002" >2</span>
 when suddenly a great earthquake occurred. For an angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled away the stone, and seated himself on it. <span class="verse" rel="v040028003" id="028003" >3</span>
 His appearance was as dazzling as lightning, and his clothing was as white as snow; <span class="verse" rel="v040028004" id="028004" >4</span>
 and, in their terror of him, the men on guard trembled violently and became like dead men. <span class="verse" rel="v040028005" id="028005" >5</span>
 But the angel, addressing the women, said, “You need not be afraid. I know that it is Jesus, who was crucified, for whom you are looking. <span class="verse" rel="v040028006" id="028006" >6</span>
 He is not here; for he has risen, as he said he would. Come, and see the place where he was lying; <span class="verse" rel="v040028007" id="028007" >7</span>
 and then go quickly and say to his disciples ‘He has risen from the dead, and is going before you into Galilee; there you will see him.’ Remember, I have told you.” <span class="verse" rel="v040028008" id="028008" >8</span>
 They left the tomb quickly, in awe and great joy, and ran to tell the news to the disciples. <span class="verse" rel="v040028009" id="028009" >9</span>
 Suddenly Jesus met them.  <span class="woc"> “Welcome!” </span>  he said. The women went up to him, and clasped his feet, bowing to the ground before him. Then Jesus said to them, <span class="verse" rel="v040028010" id="028010" >10</span>
<span class="woc"> “Do not be afraid; go and tell my brothers and sisters to set out for Galilee, and they will see me there.” </span><span class="verse" rel="v040028011" id="028011" >11</span>
 While they were still on their way, some of the guard came into the city, and reported to the chief priests everything that had happened. <span class="verse" rel="v040028012" id="028012" >12</span>
 So they and the elders met and, after holding a consultation, gave a large sum of money to the soldiers, <span class="verse" rel="v040028013" id="028013" >13</span>
 and told them to say that his disciples came in the night, and stole him while they were asleep; <span class="verse" rel="v040028014" id="028014" >14</span>
 “And should this matter come before the Governor,” they added, “we will satisfy him, and see that you have nothing to fear.” <span class="verse" rel="v040028015" id="028015" >15</span>
 So the soldiers took the money, and did as they were instructed. This story spread widely; the people of Judea still tell it today. 
<!-- 028 015 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v040028016" id="028016" >16</span>
 The eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus told them to meet him; <span class="verse" rel="v040028017" id="028017" >17</span>
 and, when they saw him, they bowed to the ground before him; although some felt doubtful. <span class="verse" rel="v040028018" id="028018" >18</span>
 Then Jesus came up, and spoke to them, saying,  <span class="woc"> “All authority in heaven and on the earth has been given to me. </span><span class="verse" rel="v040028019" id="028019" >19</span>
<span class="woc"> Therefore go and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, </span><span class="verse" rel="v040028020" id="028020" >20</span>
<span class="woc"> and teaching them to lay to heart all the commands that I have given you; and, remember, I myself am with you every day until the close of the age.” </span>

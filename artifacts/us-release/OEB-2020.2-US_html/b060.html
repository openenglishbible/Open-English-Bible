<h1>Peter’s First Letter</h1>
<h6>Introduction</h6>
<!-- 001 001 -->


<p class="smallcappara"><span class="chapter" id="001001">1</span><span class="dropcap">T</span>o the people of God who are living abroad, dispersed throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Roman Asia, and Bithynia, <span class="verse" rel="v060001002" id="001002" >2</span>
 and who were chosen in accordance with the foreknowledge of God the Father, through the consecration of the Spirit, to learn obedience, and to be purified by the sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ, from Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ. May blessing and peace be yours in ever increasing measure. 
<h6>The Christian’s Hope of Salvation</h6>
<!-- 001 002 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v060001003" id="001003" >3</span>
 Blessed is the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has, in his great mercy, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, <span class="verse" rel="v060001004" id="001004" >4</span>
 given us the new life of undying hope, that promises an inheritance, imperishable, stainless, unfading, which has been reserved for you in heaven – <span class="verse" rel="v060001005" id="001005" >5</span>
 for you who, through faith, are being guarded by the power of God, awaiting a salvation that is ready to be revealed in the last days. <span class="verse" rel="v060001006" id="001006" >6</span>
 At the thought of this you are full of exultation, though (if it has been necessary) you have suffered for the moment somewhat from various trials; <span class="verse" rel="v060001007" id="001007" >7</span>
 that the genuineness of your faith – a thing far more precious than gold, which is perishable, yet has to be tested by fire – may win praise and glory and honor at the appearing of Jesus Christ. <span class="verse" rel="v060001008" id="001008" >8</span>
 Though you have never seen him, yet you love him; though you do not even now see him, yet you believe in him, and exalt with a triumphant happiness too great for words, <span class="verse" rel="v060001009" id="001009" >9</span>
 as you receive the reward of your faith in the salvation of your souls! <span class="verse" rel="v060001010" id="001010" >10</span>
 It was this salvation that the prophets, who spoke long ago of the blessing intended for you, sought, and strove to comprehend; <span class="verse" rel="v060001011" id="001011" >11</span>
 as they strove to discern what that time could be, to which the Spirit of Christ within them was pointing, when foretelling the sufferings that Christ would have to endure, and the glories that would follow. <span class="verse" rel="v060001012" id="001012" >12</span>
 And it was revealed to them that it was not for themselves, but for you, that they were acting as Ministers of the truths which have now been told to you, by those who, with the help of the Holy Spirit sent from heaven, have brought you the good news – truths into which even angels long to look. 
<h6>The Christian’s Character</h6>
<!-- 001 012 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v060001013" id="001013" >13</span>
 Therefore concentrate your minds, with the strictest self-control, and fix your hopes on the blessing that is coming for you at the appearing of Jesus Christ. <span class="verse" rel="v060001014" id="001014" >14</span>
 Be like obedient children; do not let your lives be shaped by the passions which once swayed you in the days of your ignorance, <span class="verse" rel="v060001015" id="001015" >15</span>
 but in your whole life show yourselves to be holy, after the pattern of the Holy One from whom you received your call. <span class="verse" rel="v060001016" id="001016" >16</span>
 For scripture says – 
<p class="indent1"> ‘You will be holy, because I am holy.’ 
<!-- 001 016 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v060001017" id="001017" >17</span>
 And since you call on him as ‘Father,’ who judges everyone impartially by what he has done, let respectful awe be the spirit of your lives during the time of your stay on earth. <span class="verse" rel="v060001018" id="001018" >18</span>
 For you know that it was not by perishable things, such as silver and gold, that you were ransomed from the aimless way of living which was handed down to you from your ancestors, <span class="verse" rel="v060001019" id="001019" >19</span>
 but by precious blood, as it were of a lamb, unblemished and spotless, the blood of Christ. <span class="verse" rel="v060001020" id="001020" >20</span>
 Destined for this before the beginning of the world, he has been revealed in these last days for your sakes, <span class="verse" rel="v060001021" id="001021" >21</span>
 who, through him, are faithful to God who raised him from the dead and gave him honor, so that your faith and hope are now in God. 
<!-- 001 021 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v060001022" id="001022" >22</span>
 Now that, by your obedience to the truth, you have purified your lives, so that there is growing up among you a genuine affection, love one another earnestly with all your hearts; <span class="verse" rel="v060001023" id="001023" >23</span>
 since your new life has come, not from perishable, but imperishable, seed, through the message of the Everliving God. <span class="verse" rel="v060001024" id="001024" >24</span>
 For – 
<p class="indent1"> ‘All earthly life is but as grass, 
<p class="indent2"> and all its splendor as the flower of grass. 
<p class="indent1"> The grass fades, 
<p class="indent2"> its flower falls, 
<p class="indent3"><span class="verse" rel="v060001025" id="001025" >25</span>
 but the teaching of the Lord remains for ever.’ 
<!-- 001 025 -->


<p> And that is the teaching of the good news which has been told to you. <span class="chapter" id="002001">2</span> Now that you have done with all malice, all deceitfulness, insincerity, jealous feelings, and all backbiting, <span class="verse" rel="v060002002" id="002002" >2</span>
 like newly born infants, crave pure spiritual milk, so that you may be enabled by it to grow until you attain salvation – <span class="verse" rel="v060002003" id="002003" >3</span>
 since ‘you have found by experience that the Lord is kind.’ <span class="verse" rel="v060002004" id="002004" >4</span>
 Come to him, then, as to a living stone, rejected, indeed, by men, but in God’s eyes choice and precious; <span class="verse" rel="v060002005" id="002005" >5</span>
 and, as living stones, form yourselves into a spiritual house, to be a consecrated priesthood, for the offering of spiritual sacrifices that will be acceptable to God through Jesus Christ. <span class="verse" rel="v060002006" id="002006" >6</span>
 For there is a passage of scripture that runs – 
<p class="indent1"> ‘See, I am placing in Zion a choice and precious cornerstone; 
<p class="indent2"> and those who believe in him will have no cause for shame.’ 
<!-- 002 006 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v060002007" id="002007" >7</span>
 It is to you, then, who believe in him that he is precious, but to those who do not believe he is ‘a stone which, though rejected by the builders, has now itself become the corner-stone,’ <span class="verse" rel="v060002008" id="002008" >8</span>
 and ‘a stumbling-block, and a rock which will prove a hindrance.’ They stumble because they do not accept the message. This was the fate destined for them. <span class="verse" rel="v060002009" id="002009" >9</span>
 But you are ‘a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a consecrated nation, God’s own people,’ entrusted with the proclamation of the goodness of him who called you out of darkness into his wonderful light. <span class="verse" rel="v060002010" id="002010" >10</span>
 Once you were ‘not a people,’ but now you are ‘God’s people’; once you ‘had not found mercy,’ but now you ‘have found mercy.’ 
<h6>Practical Appeals in view of the Dangers of the Times.</h6>
<!-- 002 010 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v060002011" id="002011" >11</span>
 Dear friends, I beg you, as pilgrims and strangers on earth, to refrain from indulging the cravings of your earthly nature, for they make war on the soul. <span class="verse" rel="v060002012" id="002012" >12</span>
 Let your daily life among the Gentiles be so upright, that, whenever they malign you as evildoers, they may learn, as they watch, from the uprightness of your conduct, to praise God ‘at the time when he will visit them.’ 
<!-- 002 012 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v060002013" id="002013" >13</span>
 Submit to all human institutions for the Lord’s sake, alike to the emperor as the supreme authority, <span class="verse" rel="v060002014" id="002014" >14</span>
 and to governors as sent by him to punish evildoers and to commend those who do right. <span class="verse" rel="v060002015" id="002015" >15</span>
 For God’s will is this – that you should silence the ignorance of foolish people by doing what is right. <span class="verse" rel="v060002016" id="002016" >16</span>
 Act as free people, yet not using your freedom as those do who make it a cloak for wickedness, but as Servants of God. <span class="verse" rel="v060002017" id="002017" >17</span>
 Show honor to everyone, love the Lord’s followers, ‘revere God, honor the emperor.’ 
<!-- 002 017 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v060002018" id="002018" >18</span>
 Those of you who are domestic servants should always be submissive and respectful to their masters, not only to those who are good and considerate, but also to those who are arbitrary. <span class="verse" rel="v060002019" id="002019" >19</span>
 For this wins God’s approval when, because conscious of God’s presence, a person who is suffering unjustly bears their troubles patiently. <span class="verse" rel="v060002020" id="002020" >20</span>
 What credit can you claim when, after doing wrong, you take your punishment for it patiently? But, on the other hand, if, after doing right, you take your sufferings patiently, that does win the approval of God. <span class="verse" rel="v060002021" id="002021" >21</span>
 For it was to this that you were called! For Christ, too, suffered – on your behalf – and left you an example, that you should follow in his steps. <span class="verse" rel="v060002022" id="002022" >22</span>
 He ‘never sinned, nor was anything deceitful ever heard from his lips.’ <span class="verse" rel="v060002023" id="002023" >23</span>
 He was abused, but he did not answer with abuse; he suffered, but he did not threaten; he entrusted himself to him whose judgments are just. <span class="verse" rel="v060002024" id="002024" >24</span>
 And he ‘himself carried our sins’ in his own body to the cross, so that we might die to our sins, and live for righteousness. ‘His bruising was your healing.’ <span class="verse" rel="v060002025" id="002025" >25</span>
 Once you were straying like sheep, but now you have returned to the shepherd and guardian of your souls. 
<!-- 003 025 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="003001">3</span> Again, you married women should submit to your husbands, so that if any of them reject the message, they may, apart from the message, be won over, by the conduct of their wives, <span class="verse" rel="v060003002" id="003002" >2</span>
 as they see your pure, reverent conduct. <span class="verse" rel="v060003003" id="003003" >3</span>
 Yours should be, not the external adornment of the arrangement of the hair, the wearing of jewelry, or the putting on of dresses, <span class="verse" rel="v060003004" id="003004" >4</span>
 but the inner life with the imperishable beauty of a quiet and gentle spirit; for this is very precious in God’s sight. <span class="verse" rel="v060003005" id="003005" >5</span>
 It was by this that the holy women of old, who rested their hopes on God, adorned themselves; submitting to their husbands, <span class="verse" rel="v060003006" id="003006" >6</span>
 as Sarah did, who obeyed Abraham, and called him master. And you are her true children, as long as you live good lives, and let nothing terrify you. 
<!-- 003 006 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v060003007" id="003007" >7</span>
 Again, those of you who are married men should live considerately with their wives, showing due regard to their sex, as physically weaker than their own, and not forgetting that they share with you in the gift of life. Then you will be able to pray without hindrance. 
<!-- 003 007 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v060003008" id="003008" >8</span>
 Lastly, you should all be united, sympathetic, full of love for each other, kind-hearted, humble-minded; <span class="verse" rel="v060003009" id="003009" >9</span>
 never returning evil for evil, or abuse for abuse, but, on the contrary, blessing. It was to this that you were called – to obtain a blessing! 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v060003010" id="003010" >10</span>
 ‘The person who wants to enjoy life 
<p class="indent2"> and see happy days – 
<p class="indent1"> they should keep their tongue from evil 
<p class="indent2"> and their lips from deceitful words, 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v060003011" id="003011" >11</span>
 they should turn from evil and do good, 
<p class="indent2"> They should seek for peace and follow after it; 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v060003012" id="003012" >12</span>
 For the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous, 
<p class="indent2"> and his ears are attentive to their prayers, 
<p class="indent3"> but the face of the Lord is set against those who do wrong.’ <p>
<!-- 003 012 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v060003013" id="003013" >13</span>
 Who, indeed, is there to harm you, if you prove yourselves to be eager for what is good? <span class="verse" rel="v060003014" id="003014" >14</span>
 Even if you should suffer for righteousness, count yourselves blessed! ‘Do not let people terrify you, or allow yourselves to be dismayed.’ <span class="verse" rel="v060003015" id="003015" >15</span>
 Revere the Christ as Lord in your hearts; always ready to give an answer to anyone who asks your reason for the hope that you cherish, but giving it with courtesy and respect, <span class="verse" rel="v060003016" id="003016" >16</span>
 and keeping your consciences clear, so that, whenever you are maligned, those who vilify your good and Christian conduct may be put to shame. <span class="verse" rel="v060003017" id="003017" >17</span>
 It is better that you should suffer, if that should be God’s will, for doing right, than for doing wrong. <span class="verse" rel="v060003018" id="003018" >18</span>
 For Christ himself died to atone for sins once for all – the good on behalf of the bad – that he might bring you to God; his body being put to death, but his spirit entering on new life. <span class="verse" rel="v060003019" id="003019" >19</span>
 And it was then that he went and preached to the imprisoned spirits, <span class="verse" rel="v060003020" id="003020" >20</span>
 who once were disobedient, at the time when God patiently waited, in the days of Noah, while the ark was being prepared; in which some few lives, eight in all, were saved by means of water. <span class="verse" rel="v060003021" id="003021" >21</span>
 And baptism, which this foreshadowed, now saves you – not the mere cleansing of the body, but the search of a clear conscience after God – through the resurrection of Jesus Christ, <span class="verse" rel="v060003022" id="003022" >22</span>
 who has gone into heaven, and is at God’s right hand, where angels and archangels and the powers of heaven now yield submission to him. 
<!-- 004 022 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="004001">4</span> Since, then, Christ suffered in body, arm yourselves with the same resolve as he; for he who has suffered in body has ceased to sin, <span class="verse" rel="v060004002" id="004002" >2</span>
 and so will live the rest of his earthly life guided, not by human passions, but by the will of God. <span class="verse" rel="v060004003" id="004003" >3</span>
 Surely in the past you have spent time enough living as the Gentiles delight to live. For your path has lain among scenes of debauchery, licentiousness, drunkenness, revelry, hard-drinking, and profane idolatry. <span class="verse" rel="v060004004" id="004004" >4</span>
 And, because you do not run to the same extremes of profligacy as others, they are astonished, and malign you. <span class="verse" rel="v060004005" id="004005" >5</span>
 But they will have to answer for their conduct to him who is ready to judge both the living and the dead. <span class="verse" rel="v060004006" id="004006" >6</span>
 For that was why the good news was told to the dead also – that, after they have been judged in the body, as people are judged, they might live in the spirit, as God lives. <p>
<!-- 004 006 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v060004007" id="004007" >7</span>
 But the end of all things is near. Therefore exercise self-restraint and be calm, so that you may be able to pray. <span class="verse" rel="v060004008" id="004008" >8</span>
 Above all things, let your love for one another be earnest, for ‘Love throws a veil over countless sins.’ <span class="verse" rel="v060004009" id="004009" >9</span>
 Never grudge hospitality to one another. <span class="verse" rel="v060004010" id="004010" >10</span>
 Whatever the gift that each has received, use it in the service of others, as good stewards of the varied bounty of God. <span class="verse" rel="v060004011" id="004011" >11</span>
 When anyone speaks, they should speak as one who is delivering the oracles of God. When anyone is endeavoring to serve others, they should do so in reliance on the strength which God supplies; so that in everything God may be honored through Jesus Christ – to whom be ascribed all honor and might for ever and ever. Amen. <p>
<!-- 004 011 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v060004012" id="004012" >12</span>
 Dear friends, do not be astonished at the trial of fire that you are passing through, to test you, as though something strange were happening to you. <span class="verse" rel="v060004013" id="004013" >13</span>
 No, the more you share the sufferings of the Christ, the more may you rejoice, that, when the time comes for the manifestation of his glory, you may rejoice and exult. <span class="verse" rel="v060004014" id="004014" >14</span>
 If you are insulted for bearing the name of Christ, count yourselves blessed; because the divine glory and the Spirit of God are resting on you. <span class="verse" rel="v060004015" id="004015" >15</span>
 I need hardly say that no one among you must suffer as a murderer, or a thief, or a criminal, or for interfering in matters which do not concern Christians. <span class="verse" rel="v060004016" id="004016" >16</span>
 But, if someone suffers as a Christian, they should not be ashamed of it; they should bring honor to God even though they bear that name. <span class="verse" rel="v060004017" id="004017" >17</span>
 For the time has come for judgment to begin with the house of God; and, if it begins with us, what will be the end of those who reject God’s good news? <span class="verse" rel="v060004018" id="004018" >18</span>
 If ‘a good person is saved only with difficulty, what will become of the godless and the sinful?’ <span class="verse" rel="v060004019" id="004019" >19</span>
 Therefore, I say, let those who suffer, because God wills it so, commit their lives into the hands of a faithful Creator, and persevere in doing right.

<p><span class="chapter" id="005001">5</span> As for the older ones among you, who are elders in the church, I, their fellow elder, and a witness to the sufferings of the Christ, who will also share in the glory that is to be revealed – <span class="verse" rel="v060005002" id="005002" >2</span>
 I beg you to be true shepherds of the flock of God among you, not because you are compelled, but of your own free will; not from a base love of gain, but with a ready spirit; <span class="verse" rel="v060005003" id="005003" >3</span>
 not as lords of your charges, but as examples to your flock. <span class="verse" rel="v060005004" id="005004" >4</span>
 Then, when the chief shepherd appears, you will win the crown of glory that never fades. <span class="verse" rel="v060005005" id="005005" >5</span>
 Again, you younger ones should show deference to the older. And all of you should put on the badge of humility in mutual service, for ‘God is opposed to the proud, but gives his help to the humble.’ <p>

 laying all your anxieties on him, for he makes you his care. <span class="verse" rel="v060005008" id="005008" >8</span>
 Exercise self-control, be watchful. Your adversary, the devil, like a roaring lion, is prowling about, eager to devour you. <span class="verse" rel="v060005009" id="005009" >9</span>
 Stand firm against him, strong in your faith; knowing, as you do, that the sufferings which you are undergoing are being endured to the full by the Lord’s followers throughout the world. <span class="verse" rel="v060005010" id="005010" >10</span>
 God, from whom all help comes, and who called you, by your union with Christ, into his eternal glory, will, when you have suffered for a little while, himself perfect, establish, strengthen you. <span class="verse" rel="v060005011" id="005011" >11</span>
 To him be ascribed dominion for ever. Amen. <p>

 Your sister church in ‘Babylon’ sends you greeting, and so does Mark, who is as a son to me. <span class="verse" rel="v060005014" id="005014" >14</span>
 Greet one another with the kiss of love. <p>

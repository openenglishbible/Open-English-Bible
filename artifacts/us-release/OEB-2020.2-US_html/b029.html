<h1>Joel</h1>
<p class="indent1"><span class="chapter" id="001001">1</span><span class="dropcap">T</span>he  <span class="nd"> Lord </span> ’s message that came to Joel, son of Pethuel. 
<h6>Locust plague and drought</h6>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v029001002" id="001002" >2</span>
 Hear this, elders, 
<p class="indent2"> pay attention, all inhabitants of the land. 
<p class="indent1"> Has anything like this happened in your days, 
<p class="indent2"> or in the days of your ancestors? 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v029001003" id="001003" >3</span>
 Recount it to your children; 
<p class="indent2"> let your children tell it to their children, 
<p class="indent2"> and their children to the generation that follows. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v029001004" id="001004" >4</span>
 That which the cutting locust has left, 
<p class="indent2"> the swarming locust has eaten, 
<p class="indent1"> that which the swarming locust has left, 
<p class="indent2"> the hopping locust has eaten, 
<p class="indent1"> and that which the hopping locust has left, 
<p class="indent2"> the destroying locust has eaten. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v029001005" id="001005" >5</span>
 Awake, drunkards, and weep, 
<p class="indent2"> and wail, all drinkers of wine; 
<p class="indent2"> the new wine is cut off from your mouth. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v029001006" id="001006" >6</span>
 For a nation has come up on my land, 
<p class="indent2"> powerful, and numberless; 
<p class="indent1"> its teeth are the teeth of a lion, 
<p class="indent2"> and its jaw-teeth are like those of a lioness. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v029001007" id="001007" >7</span>
 It has laid waste my vines, 
<p class="indent2"> and barked my fig tree; 
<p class="indent1"> it has peeled and cast it away, 
<p class="indent2"> bleached are the branches. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v029001008" id="001008" >8</span>
 Wail as a bride, clad in sack-cloth, 
<p class="indent2"> for the husband of her youth. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v029001009" id="001009" >9</span>
 Cut off are the cereal and drink-offerings 
<p class="indent2"> from the house of the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>; 
<p class="indent1"> in mourning are the priests, 
<p class="indent2"> who minister at the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span> ’s altar. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v029001010" id="001010" >10</span>
 The fields are blasted, 
<p class="indent2"> the land is in mourning, 
<p class="indent1"> for ruined is the grain, 
<p class="indent2"> the new wine fails 
<p class="indent2"> and the oil is dried up. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v029001011" id="001011" >11</span>
 Be dismayed, farmers; 
<p class="indent2"> wail, vine-dressers. 
<p class="indent1"> For the wheat and the barley; 
<p class="indent2"> for the harvest is lost from the fields. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v029001012" id="001012" >12</span>
 The vine fails to bear fruit, 
<p class="indent2"> and the fig tree is drooping; 
<p class="indent1"> the pomegranate, palm, and apple, 
<p class="indent2"> all the trees of the field are dried up. 
<p class="indent1"> The people’s joy withers. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v029001013" id="001013" >13</span>
 Put on sackcloth, and beat your breasts, priests; 
<p class="indent2"> wail, ministers of the altar; 
<p class="indent2"> come, lie all night in sack-cloth, ministers of God; 
<p class="indent1"> for cereal-offering and drink-offering 
<p class="indent2"> are cut off from the house of your God. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v029001014" id="001014" >14</span>
 Sanctify a fast, 
<p class="indent2"> summon an assembly, 
<p class="indent1"> gather the elders and all the inhabitants of the land 
<p class="indent2"> into the house of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  your God, 
<p class="indent1"> cry to the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>: 
<p class="indent2"><span class="verse" rel="v029001015" id="001015" >15</span>
 Alas for the day! 
<p class="indent1"> Near at hand is the day of the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, 
<p class="indent2"> and as destruction from the Almighty it comes. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v029001016" id="001016" >16</span>
 Is not food cut off 
<p class="indent2"> from before us, 
<p class="indent1"> gladness and joy 
<p class="indent2"> from the house of our God? 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v029001017" id="001017" >17</span>
 The grains shrivel under their hoes, 
<p class="indent2"> the storehouses are desolate, 
<p class="indent2"> the barns broken down, 
<p class="indent2"> for the grain is withered. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v029001018" id="001018" >18</span>
 How the herds of cattle bellow in distress, 
<p class="indent2"> for they have no pasture! 
<p class="indent1"> The flocks of sheep are forlorn. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v029001019" id="001019" >19</span>
 To you, the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, I cry. 
<p class="indent1"> For fire has devoured 
<p class="indent2"> the pastures of the wilderness, 
<p class="indent2"> and flame has scorched 
<p class="indent2"> all the trees of the field. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v029001020" id="001020" >20</span>
 The wild animals also look up to you longingly, 
<p class="indent2"> for the water-courses are dried up, 
<p class="indent2"> and fire has devoured the pastures of the wilderness. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="chapter" id="002001">2</span> Blow a horn in Zion, 
<p class="indent2"> sound an alarm in my holy mountain, 
<p class="indent1"> let all the inhabitants of the land tremble, 
<p class="indent2"> for the day of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  comes, 
<p class="indent2"> for near is <span class="verse" rel="v029002002" id="002002" >2</span>
 the day of darkness and gloom, 
<p class="indent2"> the day of cloud and thick darkness! <p>
<p class="indent1"> Like the light of dawn scattered over the mountains, 
<p class="indent2"> a people great and powerful; 
<p class="indent1"> its like has not been from of old, 
<p class="indent2"> neither will be any more after it, 
<p class="indent2"> even to the years of coming ages. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v029002003" id="002003" >3</span>
 Before them the fire devours, 
<p class="indent2"> and behind them a flame burns; 
<p class="indent1"> like the garden of Eden is the land before them, 
<p class="indent2"> and after them it is a desolate desert, 
<p class="indent1"> nothing escapes them. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v029002004" id="002004" >4</span>
 Their appearance is as the appearance of horses, 
<p class="indent2"> and like horsemen they charge. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v029002005" id="002005" >5</span>
 Like the sound of chariots on the tops of the mountains they leap, 
<p class="indent2"> like the crackle of flames devouring stubble, 
<p class="indent1"> like a mighty people preparing for battle. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v029002006" id="002006" >6</span>
 Peoples are in anguish before them, 
<p class="indent2"> all faces grow pale. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v029002007" id="002007" >7</span>
 Like mighty men they run, 
<p class="indent2"> like warriors they mount up a wall, 
<p class="indent1"> they march each by himself, 
<p class="indent2"> they break not their ranks, 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v029002008" id="002008" >8</span>
 none jostles the other. <p>
<p class="indent1"> They march each in his path. 
<p class="indent2"> They fall upon the weapons without breaking. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v029002009" id="002009" >9</span>
 They scour the city, they run on the wall. 
<p class="indent2"> They climb up into the houses. 
<p class="indent1"> Like a thief they enter the windows. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v029002010" id="002010" >10</span>
 Earth trembles before them, 
<p class="indent2"> the sky quakes, 
<p class="indent1"> the sun and moon become dark, 
<p class="indent2"> and the stars withdraw their shining; 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v029002011" id="002011" >11</span>
 and the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  utters his voice before his army, 
<p class="indent2"> for his host is exceedingly great. 
<p class="indent1"> Mighty is he who performs his word. 
<p class="indent2"> For great is the day of the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, 
<p class="indent1"> it is terrible, who can endure it? <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v029002012" id="002012" >12</span>
 But now this is the message of the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>: 
<p class="indent1"> Turn to me with all your heart, 
<p class="indent2"> and with fasting and weeping and mourning, 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v029002013" id="002013" >13</span>
 rend your hearts and not your garments, 
<p class="indent2"> and turn to the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  your God; 
<p class="indent1"> for he indeed is gracious and merciful, 
<p class="indent2"> slow to anger and plenteous in love, 
<p class="indent1"> and relents of the evil. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v029002014" id="002014" >14</span>
 Who knows but he will turn and relent, 
<p class="indent2"> and leave a blessing behind him, 
<p class="indent2"> a cereal and drink-offering for the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  your God. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v029002015" id="002015" >15</span>
 Blow a horn in Zion, 
<p class="indent2"> sanctify a fast, summon an assembly, 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v029002016" id="002016" >16</span>
 gather the people, make holy the congregation, 
<p class="indent2"> assemble the elders, 
<p class="indent1"> gather the children, 
<p class="indent2"> and the infants at the breast. 
<p class="indent1"> Let the bridegroom come forth from his chamber, 
<p class="indent2"> and the bride from her bridal tent. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v029002017" id="002017" >17</span>
 Between the porch and the altar, 
<p class="indent1"> let the priests, the ministers of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  weep aloud, 
<p class="indent1"> let them say: 
<p class="indent2"> Spare, the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, your people. 
<p class="indent2"> Make not your heritage an object of reproach, 
<p class="indent2"> for the heathen to mock them. 
<p class="indent2"> Why should it be said among the nations, ‘Where is their God?’

<p><span class="verse" rel="v029002018" id="002018" >18</span>
 Then the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  became deeply concerned for his land, and took pity upon his people, <span class="verse" rel="v029002019" id="002019" >19</span>
 and the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  answered and said to his people: 
<p class="indent1"> I will send you grain, wine, and oil. 
<p class="indent2"> You will be satisfied. 
<p class="indent1"> I will not make you again 
<p class="indent2"> an object of scorn among the nations, 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v029002020" id="002020" >20</span>
 I will remove far from you the northern foe, 
<p class="indent2"> and I will drive it into a land barren and desolate, 
<p class="indent1"> its front into the eastern sea, 
<p class="indent2"> and its rear to the western sea. 
<p class="indent1"> And from it a stench will arise. <p>
<p class="indent1"> He has done great things! 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v029002021" id="002021" >21</span>
 Fear not, land, exult. 
<p class="indent2"> Rejoice for the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  has done great things! 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v029002022" id="002022" >22</span>
 Fear not, animals of the field. 
<p class="indent2"> For the pastures of the wilderness are putting forth new grass, 
<p class="indent1"> for the trees bear their fruit, 
<p class="indent2"> fig tree and vine yield full harvest. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v029002023" id="002023" >23</span>
 Be glad, then, children of Zion, 
<p class="indent2"> and rejoice in the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  your God, 
<p class="indent1"> for he has given you the early rain in just measure, 
<p class="indent2"> and poured down upon you the winter rain, 
<p class="indent1"> and sent the latter rain as before. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v029002024" id="002024" >24</span>
 The threshing floors will be full of grain, 
<p class="indent2"> and the vats will overflow with new wine and oil. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v029002025" id="002025" >25</span>
 I will repay you for the years 
<p class="indent2"> which the swarming locust has eaten. 
<p class="indent1"> The hopping, the destroying, and the cutting locusts, 
<p class="indent2"> my great army which I sent among you, 
<p class="indent2"> and my people will never again be put to shame. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v029002026" id="002026" >26</span>
 You will eat your food and be satisfied, 
<p class="indent2"> and praise the name of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  your God, 
<p class="indent1"> who has dealt so wonderfully by you, 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v029002027" id="002027" >27</span>
 and you will know that I am in the midst of Israel, 
<p class="indent2"> that I am the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  your God and none else, 
<p class="indent2"> and my people will never again be put to shame. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v029002028" id="002028" >28</span>
 Afterwards, 
<p class="indent2"> I will pour out my spirit on everyone. 
<p class="indent1"> Your sons and your daughters will prophesy, 
<p class="indent2"> your old men will dream dreams. 
<p class="indent1"> Your young men will see visions, 
<p class="indent2"><span class="verse" rel="v029002029" id="002029" >29</span>
 and even on your male and female slaves 
<p class="indent1"> in those days, I will pour out my spirit. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v029002030" id="002030" >30</span>
 And I will show signs in the sky and on earth: 
<p class="indent2"> Blood and fire and pillars of smoke. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v029002031" id="002031" >31</span>
 The sun will be turned into darkness, 
<p class="indent2"> and the moon into blood 
<p class="indent1"> before the coming of the great and terrible day of the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>. 
<!-- 002 031 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v029002032" id="002032" >32</span>
 But whoever will call upon the name of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  will be saved. For in Mount Zion and in Jerusalem there will be those who escape, even as the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  has said, and among the fugitives those whom the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  calls. 
<!-- 003 032 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="003001">3</span> For, in those days and in that time, when I bring back again the captivity of Judah and Jerusalem, <span class="verse" rel="v029003002" id="003002" >2</span>
 I will also gather all the nations and bring them down into the Valley of Jehoshaphat, and there I will enter into judgment with them for my people and my heritage Israel, whom they have scattered among the nations, and divided my land. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v029003003" id="003003" >3</span>
 They have cast lots for my people. 
<p class="indent1"> They have traded boys 
<p class="indent2"> for prostitutes, 
<p class="indent1"> and sold girls for wine, 
<p class="indent2"> and drunk it.

<p><span class="verse" rel="v029003004" id="003004" >4</span>
 What are you to me, Tyre and Sidon and all the districts of Philistia? Were you repaying any deed of mine, or were you doing something for me? Quickly will I return your deed upon your heads. <span class="verse" rel="v029003005" id="003005" >5</span>
 You who have taken my silver and my gold, and you have brought my goodly jewels into your palaces, <span class="verse" rel="v029003006" id="003006" >6</span>
 you have sold the people of Judah and of Jerusalem to the Greeks, so that you might remove them far from their own borders. <span class="verse" rel="v029003007" id="003007" >7</span>
 I am about to stir them up from the place to which you have sold them, and I will turn your deeds upon your own head. <span class="verse" rel="v029003008" id="003008" >8</span>
 I will sell your sons and your daughters into the hands of the people of Judah, and they will sell them to the Sabeans, to a nation far off, for the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  has spoken. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v029003009" id="003009" >9</span>
 Proclaim this among the nations, sanctify war. 
<p class="indent1"> Arouse the warriors, 
<p class="indent2"> let all the fighting men muster and go up. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v029003010" id="003010" >10</span>
 Beat your ploughshares into swords, 
<p class="indent2"> and your pruning-hooks into lances; 
<p class="indent1"> let the weak say, I, indeed, am strong. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v029003011" id="003011" >11</span>
 Bestir yourselves and come, 
<p class="indent2"> all you nations round about. 
<p class="indent1"> Quickly gather yourselves together, 
<p class="indent2"> ask the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  to bring his warriors. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v029003012" id="003012" >12</span>
 Let the nations rouse themselves 
<p class="indent2"> and come up to the Valley of Jehoshaphat, 
<p class="indent1"> for there will I sit to judge 
<p class="indent2"> all the surrounding nations. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v029003013" id="003013" >13</span>
 Put in the sickle, 
<p class="indent2"> for the harvest is ripe; 
<p class="indent1"> go in, tread, 
<p class="indent2"> for the wine press is full. 
<p class="indent1"> The vats overflow, 
<p class="indent2"> for great is their wickedness. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v029003014" id="003014" >14</span>
 Noisy multitudes, noisy multitudes 
<p class="indent2"> in the valley of decision. 
<p class="indent1"> For near is the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span> ’s day in the valley of decision! <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v029003015" id="003015" >15</span>
 Sun and moon have turned dark, 
<p class="indent2"> and the stars withdrawn their shining. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v029003016" id="003016" >16</span>
 Whenever the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  roars from Zion 
<p class="indent2"> and utters his voice from Jerusalem, 
<p class="indent1"> earth and sky quake; 
<p class="indent1"> but the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  is a refuge to his people, 
<p class="indent2"> and a fortress to the people of Israel. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v029003017" id="003017" >17</span>
 And you will know that I am the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  your God, 
<p class="indent2"> I who dwells in Zion, my holy mountain, 
<p class="indent1"> and Jerusalem will be holy, 
<p class="indent2"> and strangers will not pass through her any more. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v029003018" id="003018" >18</span>
 In that day, 
<p class="indent2"> the mountains will drop sweet wine, 
<p class="indent1"> the hills will flow with milk, 
<p class="indent2"> all the channels of Judah will flow with water, 
<p class="indent1"> a fountain will spring from the house of Judah, 
<p class="indent2"> and will water the Valley of Shittim. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v029003019" id="003019" >19</span>
 Egypt will become a desolation, 
<p class="indent2"> and Edom a wilderness, 
<p class="indent1"> because of the violence done to the people of Judah, 
<p class="indent2"> because they shed innocent blood in their land, 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v029003020" id="003020" >20</span>
 Judah will remain inhabited forever, 
<p class="indent2"> and Jerusalem from generation to generation. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v029003021" id="003021" >21</span>
 I will avenge their blood which I have not yet avenged. <p>
<p class="indent1"> The  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  lives in Zion!

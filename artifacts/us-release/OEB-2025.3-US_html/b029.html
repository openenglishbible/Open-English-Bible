<h1>Joel</h1>
<p class="indent1"><span class="chapter" id="001001">1</span><span class="dropcap">T</span>he  <span class="nd"> Lord </span> ’s message that came to Joel, son of Pethuel. 
<h6>Locust plague and drought</h6>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v029001002" id="001002" >2</span>
 Hear this, elders, 
<p class="indent2">  pay attention, all inhabitants of the land. 
<p class="indent1">  Has anything like this happened in your days, 
<p class="indent2">  or in the days of your ancestors? 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v029001003" id="001003" >3</span>
 Recount it to your children; 
<p class="indent2">  let your children tell it to their children, 
<p class="indent2">  and their children to the generation that follows. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v029001004" id="001004" >4</span>
 That which the cutting locust has left, 
<p class="indent2">  the swarming locust has eaten, 
<p class="indent1">  that which the swarming locust has left, 
<p class="indent2">  the hopping locust has eaten, 
<p class="indent1">  and that which the hopping locust has left, 
<p class="indent2">  the destroying locust has eaten. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v029001005" id="001005" >5</span>
 Awake, drunkards, and weep, 
<p class="indent2">  and wail, all drinkers of wine; 
<p class="indent2">  the new wine is cut off from your mouth. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v029001006" id="001006" >6</span>
 For a nation has come up on my land, 
<p class="indent2">  powerful, and numberless; 
<p class="indent1">  its teeth are the teeth of a lion, 
<p class="indent2">  and its jaw-teeth are like those of a lioness. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v029001007" id="001007" >7</span>
 It has laid waste my vines, 
<p class="indent2">  and barked my fig tree; 
<p class="indent1">  it has peeled and cast it away, 
<p class="indent2">  bleached are the branches. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v029001008" id="001008" >8</span>
 Wail as a bride, clad in sack-cloth, 
<p class="indent2">  for the husband of her youth. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v029001009" id="001009" >9</span>
 Cut off are the cereal and drink-offerings 
<p class="indent2">  from the house of the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>; 
<p class="indent1">  in mourning are the priests, 
<p class="indent2">  who minister at the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span> ’s altar. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v029001010" id="001010" >10</span>
 The fields are blasted, 
<p class="indent2">  the land is in mourning, 
<p class="indent1">  for ruined is the grain, 
<p class="indent2">  the new wine fails 
<p class="indent2">  and the oil is dried up. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v029001011" id="001011" >11</span>
 Be dismayed, farmers; 
<p class="indent2">  wail, vine-dressers. 
<p class="indent1">  For the wheat and the barley; 
<p class="indent2">  for the harvest is lost from the fields. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v029001012" id="001012" >12</span>
 The vine fails to bear fruit, 
<p class="indent2">  and the fig tree is drooping; 
<p class="indent1">  the pomegranate, palm, and apple, 
<p class="indent2">  all the trees of the field are dried up. 
<p class="indent1">  The people’s joy withers. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v029001013" id="001013" >13</span>
 Put on sackcloth, and beat your breasts, priests; 
<p class="indent2">  wail, ministers of the altar; 
<p class="indent2">  come, lie all night in sack-cloth, ministers of God; 
<p class="indent1">  for cereal-offering and drink-offering 
<p class="indent2">  are cut off from the house of your God. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v029001014" id="001014" >14</span>
 Sanctify a fast, 
<p class="indent2">  summon an assembly, 
<p class="indent1">  gather the elders and all the inhabitants of the land 
<p class="indent2">  into the house of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  your God, 
<p class="indent1">  cry to the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>: 
<p class="indent2"><span class="verse" rel="v029001015" id="001015" >15</span>
 Alas for the day! 
<p class="indent1">  Near at hand is the day of the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, 
<p class="indent2">  and as destruction from the Almighty it comes. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v029001016" id="001016" >16</span>
 Is not food cut off 
<p class="indent2">  from before us, 
<p class="indent1">  gladness and joy 
<p class="indent2">  from the house of our God? 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v029001017" id="001017" >17</span>
 The grains shrivel under their hoes, 
<p class="indent2">  the storehouses are desolate, 
<p class="indent2">  the barns broken down, 
<p class="indent2">  for the grain is withered. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v029001018" id="001018" >18</span>
 How the herds of cattle bellow in distress, 
<p class="indent2">  for they have no pasture! 
<p class="indent1">  The flocks of sheep are forlorn. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v029001019" id="001019" >19</span>
 To you, the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, I cry. 
<p class="indent1">  For fire has devoured 
<p class="indent2">  the pastures of the wilderness, 
<p class="indent2">  and flame has scorched 
<p class="indent2">  all the trees of the field. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v029001020" id="001020" >20</span>
 The wild animals also look up to you longingly, 
<p class="indent2">  for the water-courses are dried up, 
<p class="indent2">  and fire has devoured the pastures of the wilderness. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="chapter" id="002001">2</span> Blow a horn in Zion, 
<p class="indent2">  sound an alarm in my holy mountain, 
<p class="indent1">  let all the inhabitants of the land tremble, 
<p class="indent2">  for the day of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  comes, 
<p class="indent2">  for near is <span class="verse" rel="v029002002" id="002002" >2</span>
 the day of darkness and gloom, 
<p class="indent2">  the day of cloud and thick darkness! <p>
<p class="indent1">  Like the light of dawn scattered over the mountains, 
<p class="indent2">  a people great and powerful; 
<p class="indent1">  its like has not been from of old, 
<p class="indent2">  neither will be any more after it, 
<p class="indent2">  even to the years of coming ages. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v029002003" id="002003" >3</span>
 Before them the fire devours, 
<p class="indent2">  and behind them a flame burns; 
<p class="indent1">  like the garden of Eden is the land before them, 
<p class="indent2">  and after them it is a desolate desert, 
<p class="indent1">  nothing escapes them. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v029002004" id="002004" >4</span>
 Their appearance is as the appearance of horses, 
<p class="indent2">  and like horsemen they charge. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v029002005" id="002005" >5</span>
 Like the sound of chariots on the tops of the mountains they leap, 
<p class="indent2">  like the crackle of flames devouring stubble, 
<p class="indent1">  like a mighty people preparing for battle. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v029002006" id="002006" >6</span>
 Peoples are in anguish before them, 
<p class="indent2">  all faces grow pale. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v029002007" id="002007" >7</span>
 Like mighty men they run, 
<p class="indent2">  like warriors they mount up a wall, 
<p class="indent1">  they march each by himself, 
<p class="indent2">  they break not their ranks, 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v029002008" id="002008" >8</span>
 none jostles the other. <p>
<p class="indent1">  They march each in his path. 
<p class="indent2">  They fall upon the weapons without breaking. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v029002009" id="002009" >9</span>
 They scour the city, they run on the wall. 
<p class="indent2">  They climb up into the houses. 
<p class="indent1">  Like a thief they enter the windows. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v029002010" id="002010" >10</span>
 Earth trembles before them, 
<p class="indent2">  the sky quakes, 
<p class="indent1">  the sun and moon become dark, 
<p class="indent2">  and the stars withdraw their shining; 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v029002011" id="002011" >11</span>
 and the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  utters his voice before his army, 
<p class="indent2">  for his host is exceedingly great. 
<p class="indent1">  Mighty is he who performs his word. 
<p class="indent2">  For great is the day of the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, 
<p class="indent1">  it is terrible, who can endure it? <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v029002012" id="002012" >12</span>
 But now this is the message of the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>: 
<p class="indent1">  Turn to me with all your heart, 
<p class="indent2">  and with fasting and weeping and mourning, 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v029002013" id="002013" >13</span>
 rend your hearts and not your garments, 
<p class="indent2">  and turn to the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  your God; 
<p class="indent1">  for he indeed is gracious and merciful, 
<p class="indent2">  slow to anger and plenteous in love, 
<p class="indent1">  and relents of the evil. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v029002014" id="002014" >14</span>
 Who knows but he will turn and relent, 
<p class="indent2">  and leave a blessing behind him, 
<p class="indent2">  a cereal and drink-offering for the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  your God. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v029002015" id="002015" >15</span>
 Blow a horn in Zion, 
<p class="indent2">  sanctify a fast, summon an assembly, 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v029002016" id="002016" >16</span>
 gather the people, make holy the congregation, 
<p class="indent2">  assemble the elders, 
<p class="indent1">  gather the children, 
<p class="indent2">  and the infants at the breast. 
<p class="indent1">  Let the bridegroom come forth from his chamber, 
<p class="indent2">  and the bride from her bridal tent. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v029002017" id="002017" >17</span>
 Between the porch and the altar, 
<p class="indent1">  let the priests, the ministers of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  weep aloud, 
<p class="indent1">  let them say: 
<p class="indent2">  Spare, the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, your people. 
<p class="indent2">  Make not your heritage an object of reproach, 
<p class="indent2">  for the heathen to mock them. 
<p class="indent2">  Why should it be said among the nations, ‘Where is their God?’

<p><span class="verse" rel="v029002018" id="002018" >18</span>
 Then the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  became deeply concerned for his land, and took pity upon his people, <span class="verse" rel="v029002019" id="002019" >19</span>
 and the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  answered and said to his people: 
<p class="indent1">  I will send you grain, wine, and oil. 
<p class="indent2">  You will be satisfied. 
<p class="indent1">  I will not make you again 
<p class="indent2">  an object of scorn among the nations, 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v029002020" id="002020" >20</span>
 I will remove far from you the northern foe, 
<p class="indent2">  and I will drive it into a land barren and desolate, 
<p class="indent1">  its front into the eastern sea, 
<p class="indent2">  and its rear to the western sea. 
<p class="indent1">  And from it a stench will arise. <p>
<p class="indent1">  He has done great things! 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v029002021" id="002021" >21</span>
 Fear not, land, exult. 
<p class="indent2">  Rejoice for the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  has done great things! 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v029002022" id="002022" >22</span>
 Fear not, animals of the field. 
<p class="indent2">  For the pastures of the wilderness are putting forth new grass, 
<p class="indent1">  for the trees bear their fruit, 
<p class="indent2">  fig tree and vine yield full harvest. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v029002023" id="002023" >23</span>
 Be glad, then, children of Zion, 
<p class="indent2">  and rejoice in the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  your God, 
<p class="indent1">  for he has given you the early rain in just measure, 
<p class="indent2">  and poured down upon you the winter rain, 
<p class="indent1">  and sent the latter rain as before. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v029002024" id="002024" >24</span>
 The threshing floors will be full of grain, 
<p class="indent2">  and the vats will overflow with new wine and oil. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v029002025" id="002025" >25</span>
 I will repay you for the years 
<p class="indent2">  which the swarming locust has eaten. 
<p class="indent1">  The hopping, the destroying, and the cutting locusts, 
<p class="indent2">  my great army which I sent among you, 
<p class="indent2">  and my people will never again be put to shame. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v029002026" id="002026" >26</span>
 You will eat your food and be satisfied, 
<p class="indent2">  and praise the name of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  your God, 
<p class="indent1">  who has dealt so wonderfully by you, 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v029002027" id="002027" >27</span>
 and you will know that I am in the midst of Israel, 
<p class="indent2">  that I am the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  your God and none else, 
<p class="indent2">  and my people will never again be put to shame. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v029002028" id="002028" >28</span>
 Afterwards, 
<p class="indent2">  I will pour out my spirit on everyone. 
<p class="indent1">  Your sons and your daughters will prophesy, 
<p class="indent2">  your old men will dream dreams. 
<p class="indent1">  Your young men will see visions, 
<p class="indent2"><span class="verse" rel="v029002029" id="002029" >29</span>
 and even on your male and female slaves 
<p class="indent1">  in those days, I will pour out my spirit. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v029002030" id="002030" >30</span>
 And I will show signs in the sky and on earth: 
<p class="indent2">  Blood and fire and pillars of smoke. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v029002031" id="002031" >31</span>
 The sun will be turned into darkness, 
<p class="indent2">  and the moon into blood 
<p class="indent1">  before the coming of the great and terrible day of the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>. 
<!-- 002 031 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v029002032" id="002032" >32</span>
 But whoever will call upon the name of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  will be saved. For in Mount Zion and in Jerusalem there will be those who escape, even as the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  has said, and among the fugitives those whom the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  calls. 
<!-- 003 032 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="003001">3</span> For, in those days and in that time, when I bring back again the captivity of Judah and Jerusalem, <span class="verse" rel="v029003002" id="003002" >2</span>
 I will also gather all the nations and bring them down into the Valley of Jehoshaphat, and there I will enter into judgment with them for my people and my heritage Israel, whom they have scattered among the nations, and divided my land. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v029003003" id="003003" >3</span>
 They have cast lots for my people. 
<p class="indent1">  They have traded boys 
<p class="indent2">  for prostitutes, 
<p class="indent1">  and sold girls for wine, 
<p class="indent2">  and drunk it.

 What are you to me, Tyre and Sidon and all the districts of Philistia? Were you repaying any deed of mine, or were you doing something for me? Quickly will I return your deed upon your heads. <span class="verse" rel="v029003005" id="003005" >5</span>
 You who have taken my silver and my gold, and you have brought my goodly jewels into your palaces, <span class="verse" rel="v029003006" id="003006" >6</span>
 you have sold the people of Judah and of Jerusalem to the Greeks, so that you might remove them far from their own borders. <span class="verse" rel="v029003007" id="003007" >7</span>
 I am about to stir them up from the place to which you have sold them, and I will turn your deeds upon your own head. <span class="verse" rel="v029003008" id="003008" >8</span>
 I will sell your sons and your daughters into the hands of the people of Judah, and they will sell them to the Sabeans, to a nation far off, for the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  has spoken. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v029003009" id="003009" >9</span>
 Proclaim this among the nations, sanctify war. 
<p class="indent1">  Arouse the warriors, 
<p class="indent2">  let all the fighting men muster and go up. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v029003010" id="003010" >10</span>
 Beat your ploughshares into swords, 
<p class="indent2">  and your pruning-hooks into lances; 
<p class="indent1">  let the weak say, I, indeed, am strong. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v029003011" id="003011" >11</span>
 Bestir yourselves and come, 
<p class="indent2">  all you nations round about. 
<p class="indent1">  Quickly gather yourselves together, 
<p class="indent2">  ask the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  to bring his warriors. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v029003012" id="003012" >12</span>
 Let the nations rouse themselves 
<p class="indent2">  and come up to the Valley of Jehoshaphat, 
<p class="indent1">  for there will I sit to judge 
<p class="indent2">  all the surrounding nations. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v029003013" id="003013" >13</span>
 Put in the sickle, 
<p class="indent2">  for the harvest is ripe; 
<p class="indent1">  go in, tread, 
<p class="indent2">  for the wine press is full. 
<p class="indent1">  The vats overflow, 
<p class="indent2">  for great is their wickedness. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v029003014" id="003014" >14</span>
 Noisy multitudes, noisy multitudes 
<p class="indent2">  in the valley of decision. 
<p class="indent1">  For near is the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span> ’s day in the valley of decision! <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v029003015" id="003015" >15</span>
 Sun and moon have turned dark, 
<p class="indent2">  and the stars withdrawn their shining. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v029003016" id="003016" >16</span>
 Whenever the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  roars from Zion 
<p class="indent2">  and utters his voice from Jerusalem, 
<p class="indent1">  earth and sky quake; 
<p class="indent1">  but the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  is a refuge to his people, 
<p class="indent2">  and a fortress to the people of Israel. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v029003017" id="003017" >17</span>
 And you will know that I am the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  your God, 
<p class="indent2">  I who dwells in Zion, my holy mountain, 
<p class="indent1">  and Jerusalem will be holy, 
<p class="indent2">  and strangers will not pass through her any more. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v029003018" id="003018" >18</span>
 In that day, 
<p class="indent2">  the mountains will drop sweet wine, 
<p class="indent1">  the hills will flow with milk, 
<p class="indent2">  all the channels of Judah will flow with water, 
<p class="indent1">  a fountain will spring from the house of Judah, 
<p class="indent2">  and will water the Valley of Shittim. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v029003019" id="003019" >19</span>
 Egypt will become a desolation, 
<p class="indent2">  and Edom a wilderness, 
<p class="indent1">  because of the violence done to the people of Judah, 
<p class="indent2">  because they shed innocent blood in their land, 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v029003020" id="003020" >20</span>
 Judah will remain inhabited forever, 
<p class="indent2">  and Jerusalem from generation to generation. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v029003021" id="003021" >21</span>
 I will avenge their blood which I have not yet avenged. <p>
<p class="indent1">  The  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  lives in Zion!

<h1>The Book of Joshua</h1>
<h6>The Conquest of Canaan</h6>
<!-- 001 001 -->


<p class="smallcappara"><span class="chapter" id="001001">1</span><span class="dropcap">N</span>ow after the death of Moses the servant of the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  said to Joshua the son of Nun, the attendant of Moses, <span class="verse" rel="v006001002" id="001002" >2</span>
 “Moses my servant is dead. Come, cross the Jordan here, you and all this people, into the land which I assign to them, to the Israelites. <span class="verse" rel="v006001003" id="001003" >3</span>
 Every foot of ground you tread I assign to you, as I promised Moses. <span class="verse" rel="v006001004" id="001004" >4</span>
 Your frontier will stretch from the desert to Lebanon, from the great River, the river Euphrates, over all the land of the Hittites, to the great Mediterranean Sea westward. <span class="verse" rel="v006001005" id="001005" >5</span>
 No one will be able to hold their own against you all the days of your life. As I was with Moses, so I will be with you. I will never fail you nor forsake you. <span class="verse" rel="v006001006" id="001006" >6</span>
 Be strong, be brave, for you will put this people in possession of the land which I swore to their ancestors that I would give them. <span class="verse" rel="v006001007" id="001007" >7</span>
 Only be strong and brave, mindful to carry out all your orders from my servant Moses, turning neither to the right nor to the left, so that you may succeed wherever you go. <span class="verse" rel="v006001008" id="001008" >8</span>
 This book of the law you should never cease to have on your lips. You must pore over it day and night, that you may be mindful to carry out all that is written in it, for so will you make your way prosperous, so will you succeed. <span class="verse" rel="v006001009" id="001009" >9</span>
 These are my orders: be firm and brave, never be daunted or dismayed, for the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  your God is with you wherever you go.” 
<!-- 001 009 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v006001010" id="001010" >10</span>
 Then Joshua ordered the officers of the nation <span class="verse" rel="v006001011" id="001011" >11</span>
 to go through the camp and command the people to “Prepare food, for within three days you are going to cross the Jordan here and enter into possession of the land which the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  your God assigns you for your very own.” 
<!-- 001 011 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v006001012" id="001012" >12</span>
 Joshua also said to the Reubenites and the Gadites and the half tribe of Manasseh, <span class="verse" rel="v006001013" id="001013" >13</span>
 “Remember what Moses the servant of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  commanded you when he told you that the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  your God would settle you here and give you this region. <span class="verse" rel="v006001014" id="001014" >14</span>
 Your wives, your children, and your cattle can remain in this land which Moses assigned you east of the Jordan, but you must march across under arms in front of your kinsmen, every fighting man among you, to assist them, <span class="verse" rel="v006001015" id="001015" >15</span>
 until the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  settles your kinsmen like yourselves, until they get possession of the land which the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  your God assigns to them. Then you can return to your own region and occupy the land assigned you by Moses the servant of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  on the eastern bank of the Jordan.” 
<!-- 001 015 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v006001016" id="001016" >16</span>
 They answered Joshua, “Whatever you command us we will do, and wherever you send us we will go. <span class="verse" rel="v006001017" id="001017" >17</span>
 As we obeyed Moses in everything, so we will obey you. Only may the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  your God be with you as he was with Moses! <span class="verse" rel="v006001018" id="001018" >18</span>
 Whoever rebels against your orders, and will not listen to what you say by way of command, will be put to death. Only be firm and brave.” 
<!-- 002 018 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="002001">2</span> From Shittim Joshua son of Nun sent two men secretly as spies to explore the country and especially Jericho. When they arrived they went into the house of a prostitute called Rahab and stayed there. <span class="verse" rel="v006002002" id="002002" >2</span>
 The king of Jericho was told that some men of Israel had come that night to find out about the country, <span class="verse" rel="v006002003" id="002003" >3</span>
 so he sent a message to Rahab to “Bring out the men who have come to you, who have entered your house, for they are here to find out all about the country.” <span class="verse" rel="v006002004" id="002004" >4</span>
 The woman, who had taken the two men and hidden them, replied, “Yes, the men did come to me, but I did not know where they came from, <span class="verse" rel="v006002005" id="002005" >5</span>
 and just about the hour for shutting the town gate, when it was dark, the men went off. Where they went, I do not know. Quick, pursue them, for you will overtake them.” <span class="verse" rel="v006002006" id="002006" >6</span>
 Now she had taken them up to the roof and hidden them under some stalks of flax which she had arranged on the roof. <span class="verse" rel="v006002007" id="002007" >7</span>
 The pursuers went by the road to the Jordan, as far as the fords, and as soon as they left the town the gate was shut. <span class="verse" rel="v006002008" id="002008" >8</span>
 Before the two men had lain down, the woman came to them on the roof and said, <span class="verse" rel="v006002009" id="002009" >9</span>
 “I know that the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  has given you this country, and how the terror of you has fallen upon us, until all who live here are trembling before you. <span class="verse" rel="v006002010" id="002010" >10</span>
 For we have heard how the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  dried up the water of the Reed Sea  <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">       or, Red Sea </span>  before you when you left Egypt, and how you treated the two Amorite kings on the east of the Jordan, Sihon and Og, whom you wiped off the earth. <span class="verse" rel="v006002011" id="002011" >11</span>
 As soon as we heard it, our hearts trembled and everyone became utterly dispirited because of you, for the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  your God is God in heaven above and on the earth below. <span class="verse" rel="v006002012" id="002012" >12</span>
 Now then, since I have dealt kindly with you, swear to me by the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  that you will deal kindly with my family, and give me a sure sign of it. <span class="verse" rel="v006002013" id="002013" >13</span>
 Swear that you will spare the lives of my father and my mother and my brothers and my sisters and all they have, saving us from death.” <span class="verse" rel="v006002014" id="002014" >14</span>
 The men replied, “Our lives for yours – only you must not breathe a word about our errand. Then we will deal kindly and honestly with you when the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  gives us the country.” <span class="verse" rel="v006002015" id="002015" >15</span>
 Then she lowered them by a rope out of the window, for her house was on the town wall. She stayed on the town wall. <span class="verse" rel="v006002016" id="002016" >16</span>
 She told them, “Get away to the hills, so that the pursuers do not come across you. Hide yourselves there for three days until the pursuers return, and then make your way back.” <span class="verse" rel="v006002017" id="002017" >17</span>
 The men told her, “We will not be bound by this oath to you, which you have made us swear, <span class="verse" rel="v006002018" id="002018" >18</span>
 unless, when we enter the country, you tie this cord of scarlet thread outside the window through which you let us down. You must gather your father and mother and brothers and all your family inside your house. <span class="verse" rel="v006002019" id="002019" >19</span>
 Anyone who crosses the door of your house into the street, their blood be on their own head, we are not to blame. But if a hand is laid on anyone inside the house, then that person’s blood be on our head! <span class="verse" rel="v006002020" id="002020" >20</span>
 But remember, if you breathe a word about our errand, we will not be bound by the oath you have made us swear.” <span class="verse" rel="v006002021" id="002021" >21</span>
 “As you say,” answered the woman, “so be it.” So away they went, while she tied the scarlet cord to the window. <span class="verse" rel="v006002022" id="002022" >22</span>
 They went into the hills and stayed there for three days, until the pursuers returned (the pursuers looked for them all along the road and could not find them). <span class="verse" rel="v006002023" id="002023" >23</span>
 Then the two men came down from the hills and crossed over to Joshua the son of Nun, telling him all that had happened to them. <span class="verse" rel="v006002024" id="002024" >24</span>
 They said to Joshua, “The  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  has put all the country into our hands. Everyone who lives in this land is trembling before us!” 
<!-- 003 024 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="003001">3</span> In the morning Joshua rose, and he and all the Israelites set out from Shittim and reached the Jordan, where they passed the night before they crossed over. <span class="verse" rel="v006003002" id="003002" >2</span>
 Three days afterwards the officers went through the camp <span class="verse" rel="v006003003" id="003003" >3</span>
 and gave this order to the nation: “When you see the ark of the covenant of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  your God being carried by the priestly Levites, then set out and follow it, <span class="verse" rel="v006003004" id="003004" >4</span>
 so that you can learn the ford by which you are to cross, because you have never crossed here before. Only, you must not come close to the ark. Between it and you there must be a space kept of two thousand cubits.” <span class="verse" rel="v006003005" id="003005" >5</span>
 Then Joshua said to the people, “Consecrate yourselves, for tomorrow the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  will do wonders among you.” <span class="verse" rel="v006003006" id="003006" >6</span>
 To the priests he said, “Lift the ark of the covenant and go in front of the people.” So they lifted the ark of the covenant and went in front of the people. <span class="verse" rel="v006003007" id="003007" >7</span>
 And the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  said to Joshua, “This day I begin to exalt you in the sight of Israel, to let them see that as I was with Moses so I will be with you. <span class="verse" rel="v006003008" id="003008" >8</span>
 Order the priests who are carrying the ark of the covenant to stand still in the Jordan as soon as they reach the edge of the water.” <span class="verse" rel="v006003009" id="003009" >9</span>
 Then Joshua told the Israelites to come and listen to the words of the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, their God. <span class="verse" rel="v006003010" id="003010" >10</span>
 Joshua said, “This is to let you see that the living God is among you, and that he will without fail evict before you the Canaanites and the Hittites and the Hivites and the Perizzites and the Girgashites and the Amorites and the Jebusites. <span class="verse" rel="v006003011" id="003011" >11</span>
 See, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth is crossing the Jordan in front of you. <span class="verse" rel="v006003012" id="003012" >12</span>
 Now choose twelve men from the tribes of Israel, a man from each tribe. <span class="verse" rel="v006003013" id="003013" >13</span>
 Whenever the soles of the feet of the priests who carry the ark of the covenant of the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, the Lord of all the earth, rest in the water of the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan will be stopped. The waters which are flowing down, they will be dammed up.” <span class="verse" rel="v006003014" id="003014" >14</span>
 And when the people left their tents to cross the Jordan, headed by the priests who carried the ark of the covenant, <span class="verse" rel="v006003015" id="003015" >15</span>
 as soon as the bearers reached the Jordan and the feet of the priests dipped in the water at the edge (for the Jordan overflows its banks all the time of harvest), <span class="verse" rel="v006003016" id="003016" >16</span>
 the waters that flow down stopped and were dammed up at a distance, at Adam (a town beside Zarethan), while the waters that flow away to the sea of the Arabah (the Dead Sea <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">       Heb. Salt Sea </span> ) were cut off and failed. In this way the people crossed, opposite Jericho. <span class="verse" rel="v006003017" id="003017" >17</span>
 The priests who carried the ark of the covenant of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  stood still on dry ground in the middle of the Jordan, and all Israel crossed on dry ground until the whole nation had finished crossing. 
<!-- 004 017 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="004001">4</span> When the whole nation had finished crossing the Jordan, the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  said to Joshua, <span class="verse" rel="v006004002" id="004002" >2</span>
 “Take twelve men from the nation, a man from each tribe, <span class="verse" rel="v006004003" id="004003" >3</span>
 and order them to take twelve stones out of the Jordan from the spot where the feet of the priests stood firm. They must carry these stones across and place them on the spot where you spend the night.” <span class="verse" rel="v006004004" id="004004" >4</span>
 Joshua called the twelve men of Israel whom he had ready, one from each of the tribes. <span class="verse" rel="v006004005" id="004005" >5</span>
 and said to them, “Cross in front of the ark of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  your God through the Jordan, each of you taking a stone on his shoulder, one for each of the tribes of Israel. <span class="verse" rel="v006004006" id="004006" >6</span>
 They are to be a sign for your nation. When in the future your children ask what these stones mean, <span class="verse" rel="v006004007" id="004007" >7</span>
 tell them it was because the waters of the Jordan were stopped before the ark of the covenant of the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, stopped when it crossed the Jordan. These stones will be a memorial for Israel for all time.” <span class="verse" rel="v006004008" id="004008" >8</span>
 The Israelites followed Joshua’s orders. They lifted twelve stones out of the Jordan, as the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  had commanded Joshua, one for each of the tribes of Israel, and carried them over along with them to the spot where they spent the night, laying them down there. <span class="verse" rel="v006004009" id="004009" >9</span>
 Joshua also had twelve stones set up in the middle of the Jordan on the spot where the feet of the priests who carried the ark of the covenant had stood. They are there to this day. <span class="verse" rel="v006004010" id="004010" >10</span>
 For the priests who carried the ark stood in the middle of the Jordan until all was finished that Joshua was told by the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  to enjoin upon the people, all that Moses had commanded Joshua. The people hurried over, <span class="verse" rel="v006004011" id="004011" >11</span>
 and when all the people had finished crossing, the ark passed over, the priests advancing to the front of the people. <span class="verse" rel="v006004012" id="004012" >12</span>
 The Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasseh passed across under arms in front of the Israelites, as Moses had ordered them, <span class="verse" rel="v006004013" id="004013" >13</span>
 about forty thousand men equipped for war, crossing under the eyes of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  to the plains of Jericho to fight. <span class="verse" rel="v006004014" id="004014" >14</span>
 The  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  exalted Joshua that day in the eyes of all Israel. They stood in awe of him as they had stood in awe of Moses all the days of his life. <span class="verse" rel="v006004015" id="004015" >15</span>
 Then the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  said to Joshua, <span class="verse" rel="v006004016" id="004016" >16</span>
 “Order the priests who carry the ark of the testimony to step up from the Jordan.” <span class="verse" rel="v006004017" id="004017" >17</span>
 Joshua ordered the priests to step up from the Jordan, <span class="verse" rel="v006004018" id="004018" >18</span>
 and whenever the priests who carried the ark of the covenant of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  came up from the Jordan, whenever the soles of the feet of the priests were lifted on to the dry ground, the waters of the Jordan flowed back into their place and overflowed their banks as before. <span class="verse" rel="v006004019" id="004019" >19</span>
 It was on the tenth day of the first month that the people came up from the Jordan and camped at Gilgal on the eastern side of Jericho. <span class="verse" rel="v006004020" id="004020" >20</span>
 The twelve stones which they took out of the Jordan were set up by Joshua at Gilgal. <span class="verse" rel="v006004021" id="004021" >21</span>
 He said to the Israelites, “When in the future your children ask what these stones mean, <span class="verse" rel="v006004022" id="004022" >22</span>
 tell your children that Israel crossed the Jordan here on dry ground, <span class="verse" rel="v006004023" id="004023" >23</span>
 for the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  your God dried up the waters of the Jordan before you until you had passed across, as the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  your God had done to the Reed Sea, which he also dried up before us until we passed across it – <span class="verse" rel="v006004024" id="004024" >24</span>
 to let all the nations on earth know how strong is the hand of the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, that they may stand in awe of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  your God for all time.”

<p><span class="chapter" id="005001">5</span> Now when all the Amorite kings west of the Jordan and all the Canaanite kings by the Mediterranean heard how the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  had dried up the waters of the Jordan in front of the Israelites until they had got across, their hearts trembled and they were all dispirited, on account of the Israelites. 
<!-- 005 001 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v006005002" id="005002" >2</span>
 It was then that the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  said to Joshua, “Make flint knives and circumcise the Israelites once more.” <span class="verse" rel="v006005003" id="005003" >3</span>
 So Joshua made flint knives and circumcised the Israelites at the Hill of Foreskins. <span class="verse" rel="v006005004" id="005004" >4</span>
 Joshua circumcised them for this reason: all who had left Egypt, all the male warriors, had died during the journey through the desert after leaving Egypt. <span class="verse" rel="v006005005" id="005005" >5</span>
 These who had left Egypt were circumcised, but none of the people who had been born in the desert after leaving Egypt had been circumcised. <span class="verse" rel="v006005006" id="005006" >6</span>
 For forty years the Israelites had journeyed in the desert until the whole nation of warriors who had left Egypt had perished, because they would not listen to what the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  said, and because the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  had sworn to them that he would not let them see the land which the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  had sworn to their ancestors that he would give us, a land abounding in milk and honey. <span class="verse" rel="v006005007" id="005007" >7</span>
 So their children, whom the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  raised up instead of them, were circumcised by Joshua, since they had not been circumcised on the journey. <span class="verse" rel="v006005008" id="005008" >8</span>
 After the circumcising was over, the whole nation remained where they were in the camp until they had recovered. <span class="verse" rel="v006005009" id="005009" >9</span>
 Then said the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  to Joshua, “And now I have rolled off you the scorn of the Egyptians.” Hence the name of the spot was called Gilgal <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">       Gilgal sounds like the Hebrew for to roll </span> , and is so called to this day. 
<!-- 005 009 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v006005010" id="005010" >10</span>
 When the Israelites were in camp at Gilgal they kept the Passover on the evening of the fourteenth day of the month, on the plains of Jericho. <span class="verse" rel="v006005011" id="005011" >11</span>
 The day after the Passover they ate some of the produce of the land, unleavened cakes and roasted grain. <span class="verse" rel="v006005012" id="005012" >12</span>
 And that very day the manna ceased, once they ate the produce of the land. The Israelites no longer had manna, but ate hereafter the food of the land of Canaan. <span class="verse" rel="v006005013" id="005013" >13</span>
 One day, when Joshua was near Jericho, he looked up and saw a man standing before him, holding a drawn sword. Joshua went up to him and said, “Are you for us, or are you for our enemies?” <span class="verse" rel="v006005014" id="005014" >14</span>
 “Neither,” he answered, “I am here as the captain of the host of the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>.” Then Joshua fell on his face to the ground and worshipped, saying, “And what has my Lord to say to his servant?” <span class="verse" rel="v006005015" id="005015" >15</span>
 The captain of the host of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  said to Joshua, “Remove your sandals from your feet, for the place where you are standing is sacred.” Joshua did so. 
<!-- 006 015 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="006001">6</span> Now Jericho had shut its gates against the Israelites. No one left the town, and no one entered it. <span class="verse" rel="v006006002" id="006002" >2</span>
 Then the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  said to Joshua, “I am putting Jericho into your hands, with its king and all its fighting men. <span class="verse" rel="v006006003" id="006003" >3</span>
 For six days you and all your men at arms must march round the town once a day, <span class="verse" rel="v006006004" id="006004" >4</span>
 with seven priests carrying seven rams’ horns as trumpets in front of the ark. On the seventh day march round the town seven times, and the priests must blow a trumpet blast. <span class="verse" rel="v006006005" id="006005" >5</span>
 As soon as they blow a long trumpet blast on the horns, when you hear the sound, then all the people must raise a mighty shout, and the wall of the town will fall down flat, until every man of you can march in, straight in front of him.” <span class="verse" rel="v006006006" id="006006" >6</span>
 So Joshua the son of Nun called the priests and told them to lift the ark of the covenant and let seven priests carry seven rams’ horns as trumpets in front of the ark of the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>. <span class="verse" rel="v006006007" id="006007" >7</span>
 Then he told the people, “Forward, march round the town, with the armed men in front of the ark of the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>. <span class="verse" rel="v006006008" id="006008" >8</span>
 Let the seven priests with the trumpets of rams’ horns go ahead in presence of the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, blowing the trumpets, and followed by the ark of the covenant of the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>. <span class="verse" rel="v006006009" id="006009" >9</span>
 Let the armed men go in front of the priests who blow the trumpets, and let the rearguard follow the ark, the trumpets blowing.’ <span class="verse" rel="v006006010" id="006010" >10</span>
 To the people Joshua said, “You must not shout nor cry, you must not say a word, until I tell you to shout. Then shout.” <span class="verse" rel="v006006011" id="006011" >11</span>
 He had the ark of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  carried round the town, going round it once. Then all retired to the camp and passed the night there. <span class="verse" rel="v006006012" id="006012" >12</span>
 Next morning Joshua rose, the priests lifted the ark of the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, <span class="verse" rel="v006006013" id="006013" >13</span>
 and the seven priests carrying the seven rams’ horns as trumpets kept on in front of the ark of the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, blowing a blast, preceded by the armed men, with the rearguard after the ark, the trumpets blowing as they went. <span class="verse" rel="v006006014" id="006014" >14</span>
 On the second day they marched round the town once, and then retired to the camp. This they did for six days. <span class="verse" rel="v006006015" id="006015" >15</span>
 On the seventh day they rose at dawn and marched round the town seven times. This was the only day they marched seven times round it. <span class="verse" rel="v006006016" id="006016" >16</span>
 The seventh time, when the priests blew their blast, Joshua said to the people, “Shout, for the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  has given you the town. <span class="verse" rel="v006006017" id="006017" >17</span>
 It will be dedicated to the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  by destruction, the town and all in it. Only Rahab the prostitute will be spared, she and all who are with her in her house, because she hid the messengers whom we sent. <span class="verse" rel="v006006018" id="006018" >18</span>
 As for you, hands off any of the spoil which has been dedicated. If you take any of it, that would be the ruin and undoing of the camp of Israel. <span class="verse" rel="v006006019" id="006019" >19</span>
 No, all the silver and gold and articles of bronze and iron are sacred to the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  and must come to the treasury of the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>.” <span class="verse" rel="v006006020" id="006020" >20</span>
 Then the people shouted, at the trumpet blast, and when the people heard the sound of the trumpet blast and raised a mighty shout, down the wall fell flat, until every man could march in, straight in front of him. In they marched and so they took the town, <span class="verse" rel="v006006021" id="006021" >21</span>
 They massacred all in the city, men and women, old and young alike, oxen, sheep, and donkeys, giving no quarter. <span class="verse" rel="v006006022" id="006022" >22</span>
 But Joshua said to the two men who had spied out the country, “Go to the prostitute’s house and fetch the woman out, with all she has, as you swore to her.” <span class="verse" rel="v006006023" id="006023" >23</span>
 So the young spies went and brought Rahab out, with her father and mother and brothers and all she had, all her family. They placed them outside the camp of Israel. <span class="verse" rel="v006006024" id="006024" >24</span>
 The town and all in it they burned up. Only the silver and gold and all the articles of bronze and iron they put into the treasury of the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>. <span class="verse" rel="v006006025" id="006025" >25</span>
 Rahab the prostitute and her family and all she had, Joshua spared. She lived among the Israelites, as do her descendants to this day, because she hid the messengers whom Joshua sent to spy out Jericho. <span class="verse" rel="v006006026" id="006026" >26</span>
 Joshua then laid this oath upon the people: 
<p class="indent1">  “Cursed before the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  be the man 
<p class="indent1">  who starts to rebuild this town of Jericho! 
<p class="indent1">  At the cost of his oldest son will he lay its foundation, 
<p class="indent1">  and at the cost of his youngest son will he erect its gates.” 
<!-- 006 026 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v006006027" id="006027" >27</span>
 The  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  was with Joshua, and the fame of him spread all over the land. 
<!-- 007 027 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="007001">7</span> But the Israelites broke faith with regard to the spoil which had been dedicated. Achan the son of Karmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, who belonged to the tribe of Judah, took some of it, and so the anger of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  blazed against the Israelites. 
<!-- 007 001 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v006007002" id="007002" >2</span>
 Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which lies close to Beth-aven on the east of Bethel, ordering them to go up and spy out the land. They went up and spied out Ai <span class="verse" rel="v006007003" id="007003" >3</span>
 and came back to Joshua, saying, “All the nation need not go up. Let only about two or three thousand men go up and attack Ai. Do not make all the nation toil up there, for there are few people at Ai.” <span class="verse" rel="v006007004" id="007004" >4</span>
 So about three thousand men marched up. But they ran away from the men of Ai. <span class="verse" rel="v006007005" id="007005" >5</span>
 The men of Ai killed about thirty-six of them, and chased them from their gates as far as Shebarim, killing some others at the descent. The hearts of Israel trembled and became weak as water, <span class="verse" rel="v006007006" id="007006" >6</span>
 and Joshua tore his clothes and fell to the ground upon his face before the ark of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  until evening, he and the elders of Israel, with dust upon their heads. <span class="verse" rel="v006007007" id="007007" >7</span>
 “Ah, Lord  <span class="nd"> God </span> ,” said Joshua, “why did you ever bring this people across the Jordan, only to hand us over to the Amorites to be killed? Would that we had been content to stay on the other side of the Jordan. <span class="verse" rel="v006007008" id="007008" >8</span>
 O Lord, what can I say, after Israel has run away from its enemies? <span class="verse" rel="v006007009" id="007009" >9</span>
 The Canaanites and all who live in the land will hear of it and surround us and wipe us off the earth. Then what will you do for your great honor?” <span class="verse" rel="v006007010" id="007010" >10</span>
 “Get up,” said the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  to Joshua, “why are you lying on your face there? <span class="verse" rel="v006007011" id="007011" >11</span>
 Israel has sinned. They have broken my covenant which I commanded them to keep, they have taken some of the spoil which had been dedicated to me, stolen it, acted deceitfully, and hidden it among their own goods. <span class="verse" rel="v006007012" id="007012" >12</span>
 That is why the Israelites cannot stand up against their enemies and why they run from their enemies, because they have brought themselves under the dedication by destruction! I will never be with you again, unless you remove everything from among you which was dedicated to me. <span class="verse" rel="v006007013" id="007013" >13</span>
 Go and consecrate the people. Tell them to consecrate themselves for tomorrow. Tell them this from the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  the God of Israel: There is a thing dedicated to me among you, O Israel. You cannot hold your own against your enemies until you put that thing away from you. <span class="verse" rel="v006007014" id="007014" >14</span>
 So in the morning you will be brought before me by your tribes, and the tribe which the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  takes by lot must come with its clans, and the clan which the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  takes by lot must come with its families, and the men from the family which the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  takes by lot must come one by one. <span class="verse" rel="v006007015" id="007015" >15</span>
 Then he who is taken by lot, in possession of the object dedicated to me, must be killed, he and all his family, and their bodies burned, because he has broken the covenant of the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, because he has committed a scandal in Israel.” <span class="verse" rel="v006007016" id="007016" >16</span>
 In the morning Joshua rose and brought Israel before the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  by their tribes. The tribe of Judah was taken by lot. <span class="verse" rel="v006007017" id="007017" >17</span>
 Then the clans of Judah were brought, and the clan of the Zerahites was taken by lot. The clan of the Zerahites was brought by heads of families <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">       Heb. MT *man by man*, some ancient versions *family by family* </span> , and the family of Zabdi was taken by lot. <span class="verse" rel="v006007018" id="007018" >18</span>
 Then Zabdi brought his family man by man, and Achan the son of Karmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, belonging to the tribe of Judah, was taken by lot. <span class="verse" rel="v006007019" id="007019" >19</span>
 Joshua said to Achan, “My son, confess to the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, the God of Israel, own up to him. Tell me what you have done, do not hide it from me.” <span class="verse" rel="v006007020" id="007020" >20</span>
 Achan answered, “Truly I have sinned against the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, the God of Israel. This is what I did. <span class="verse" rel="v006007021" id="007021" >21</span>
 When I saw among the spoil a splendid robe from Shinar and two hundred shekels in silver and a bar of gold weighing fifty shekels, I coveted them and took them. The robe is hidden in the ground inside my tent, with the money under it.” <span class="verse" rel="v006007022" id="007022" >22</span>
 So Joshua sent messengers, who ran to the tent, and there was the robe hidden inside the tent, with the money under it! <span class="verse" rel="v006007023" id="007023" >23</span>
 They took them from the tent and brought them to Joshua and all the Israelites, who laid them before the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>. <span class="verse" rel="v006007024" id="007024" >24</span>
 Then Joshua and all the Israelites took Achan the son of Zerah and the silver and the robe and the bar of gold and his sons and his daughters and his oxen and his donkeys and his sheep and his tent and all that he had. They brought them to the valley of Achor. <span class="verse" rel="v006007025" id="007025" >25</span>
 “Why have you undone us?” said Joshua. “The  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  will undo you this day.” Then all Israel stoned him and his family to death. They burned the bodies with fire and stoned them with stones, <span class="verse" rel="v006007026" id="007026" >26</span>
 and over them they raised a great cairn of stones. It stands there to this day. Then the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  relented from his fierce anger. So the name of the place is called the Valley of Achor <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">       That is, Trouble </span>  down to this day. 
<!-- 008 026 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="008001">8</span> Then said the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  to Joshua, “Don’t be afraid or dismayed. Take all the warriors with you and march up to Ai. I put into your hands the king of Ai with his people and his town and his country. <span class="verse" rel="v006008002" id="008002" >2</span>
 Treat Ai and its king as you treated Jericho and its king, except that you may take the spoils and cattle in it for yourselves. Lay an ambush for the town to the west of it.” <span class="verse" rel="v006008003" id="008003" >3</span>
 So Joshua and all the warriors started off for Ai. Joshua picked out three thousand veterans and despatched them by night <span class="verse" rel="v006008004" id="008004" >4</span>
 with orders to “Lie in ambush to the west of the town at its rear. Do not go too far away but be all ready. <span class="verse" rel="v006008005" id="008005" >5</span>
 I and all the troops who are with me will move against the town, and when they come out against us, as before, we will run off, <span class="verse" rel="v006008006" id="008006" >6</span>
 until we draw them away from the town, for they will think we are running from them as before. Then, as we run away, <span class="verse" rel="v006008007" id="008007" >7</span>
 you must start out of your ambush and seize the town. The  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  your God will put it into your hands. <span class="verse" rel="v006008008" id="008008" >8</span>
 As soon as you have seized the town, set it on fire, and carry out the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span> ’s command. These are my orders.” <span class="verse" rel="v006008009" id="008009" >9</span>
 So Joshua despatched them, and they went to the place of ambush, remaining between Bethel and Ai, to the west of Ai. Joshua spent the night in the camp in the valley. 
<!-- 008 009 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v006008010" id="008010" >10</span>
 Joshua rose in the morning and mustered the nation. Then he and the elders of Israel led them against Ai. <span class="verse" rel="v006008011" id="008011" >11</span>
 All the nation, that is, the armed men who were with him, marched up close to the town and camped on the north of Ai. Between him and Ai lay a valley, <span class="verse" rel="v006008012" id="008012" >12</span>
 so Joshua took about five thousand men and put them in ambush between Bethel and Ai, to the west of the town. <span class="verse" rel="v006008013" id="008013" >13</span>
 The main army were thus stationed to the north of the town, with the ambush laid to the west. Joshua passed that night in the middle of the valley. <span class="verse" rel="v006008014" id="008014" >14</span>
 When the king of Ai saw this, he and his men made an early start. In the morning they rose and marched out to fight Israel at the expected place near the Arabah, not knowing that an ambush had been laid behind the town. <span class="verse" rel="v006008015" id="008015" >15</span>
 They beat Joshua and all Israel, who fled in the direction of the desert. <span class="verse" rel="v006008016" id="008016" >16</span>
 All the townsmen of Ai were called out to pursue them. They allowed themselves to be drawn away from the town. <span class="verse" rel="v006008017" id="008017" >17</span>
 Not a man was left in Ai or Bethel who did not go out after Israel, and in their pursuit of the Israelites they left the town unguarded. <span class="verse" rel="v006008018" id="008018" >18</span>
 Then said the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  to Joshua, “Stretch out the javelin in your hand towards Ai, for I put Ai in your power.” <span class="verse" rel="v006008019" id="008019" >19</span>
 And as soon as Joshua stretched out the javelin towards the town, the men in ambush rushed into the town and captured it, and hurried to set the town on fire. <span class="verse" rel="v006008020" id="008020" >20</span>
 So that when the men of Ai turned round to look, there was smoke rising from the town! They had no chance to flee this way or that, for the Israelites who were flying towards the desert turned upon their pursuers. <span class="verse" rel="v006008021" id="008021" >21</span>
 Seeing that the men in ambush had captured the town and seeing the smoke rise up from it, Joshua and the Israelites turned and attacked the men of Ai, <span class="verse" rel="v006008022" id="008022" >22</span>
 and the men in ambush rushed from the town to join them, so that the men of Ai were caught between Israelites, some on one side and some on the other. They were slaughtered until not a man escaped or remained alive. <span class="verse" rel="v006008023" id="008023" >23</span>
 The king of Ai was taken alive and brought to Joshua. 
<!-- 008 023 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v006008024" id="008024" >24</span>
 When the Israelite had finished slaughtering the townsmen of Ai who had run into the desert and when they had cut them down, giving no quarter, all Israel then returned to Ai and sacked it. <span class="verse" rel="v006008025" id="008025" >25</span>
 All the population of Ai fell that day, both men and women, twelve thousand in all. <span class="verse" rel="v006008026" id="008026" >26</span>
 Joshua never withdrew the hand that held his javelin until he had massacred all who lived in Ai. <span class="verse" rel="v006008027" id="008027" >27</span>
 Only the Israelites took the spoils and cattle of the town for themselves, as the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  had given orders to Joshua. <span class="verse" rel="v006008028" id="008028" >28</span>
 Ai itself Joshua burned, and made it a heap of ruins. To this day it lies desolate. <span class="verse" rel="v006008029" id="008029" >29</span>
 Joshua hung the king of Ai on a tree until evening. At sunset Joshua ordered his body to be taken down from the tree and thrown down at the entrance to the town-gate. They raised a cairn of stones over it, which is there to this day. <span class="verse" rel="v006008030" id="008030" >30</span>
 Then Joshua built an altar to the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, the God of Israel, on mount Ebal, <span class="verse" rel="v006008031" id="008031" >31</span>
 as Moses the servant of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  had commanded the Israelites, according to the directions written in the law book of Moses. It was an altar of undressed stones, to which no man had ever taken an iron tool. They sacrificed burnt-offerings to the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  upon it, and recompense offerings. <span class="verse" rel="v006008032" id="008032" >32</span>
 Also he wrote on the stones there a copy of the law of Moses, writing it in presence of the Israelites. <span class="verse" rel="v006008033" id="008033" >33</span>
 All Israel, both native Israelites and foreigners, with their elders, their officials, and their judges, stood on each side of the ark in presence of the priestly Levites who carried the ark of the covenant of the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>. Half of them stood in front of mount Gerizim and half in front of mount Ebal, as Moses the servant of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  had previously commanded the people to be blessed. <span class="verse" rel="v006008034" id="008034" >34</span>
 Then Joshua read aloud all the terms of the law, the blessing and the curse, exactly as it was written in the law book. <span class="verse" rel="v006008035" id="008035" >35</span>
 There was not a word of the orders of Moses which Joshua did not read aloud before all the assembled Israelites, with the women, the children, and the foreigners who accompanied them.

<p><span class="chapter" id="009001">9</span> When this was heard by all the kings west of the Jordan, in the highlands and the lowlands and all along the coast of the Mediterranean as far as Lebanon, then Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites, <span class="verse" rel="v006009002" id="009002" >2</span>
 gathered as one to attack Joshua and Israel. <span class="verse" rel="v006009003" id="009003" >3</span>
 When the citizens of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done to Jericho and Ai, <span class="verse" rel="v006009004" id="009004" >4</span>
 they went to work craftily. They took provisions in old sacks on their donkeys, and old mended wineskins, <span class="verse" rel="v006009005" id="009005" >5</span>
 with old patched sandals on their feet and old clothes on their bodies. The bread they took was all dry and crumbling. <span class="verse" rel="v006009006" id="009006" >6</span>
 They went to Joshua at the camp in Gilgal and said to him and to the Israelites, “We have come from a far country. Please make a treaty with us.” <span class="verse" rel="v006009007" id="009007" >7</span>
 ‘The Israelites said to these Hivites, “Perhaps you live in our country, so why should we make a treaty with you?” <span class="verse" rel="v006009008" id="009008" >8</span>
 “We are at your service,” they said to Joshua. “But who are you,” Joshua asked, “and where do you come from?” <span class="verse" rel="v006009009" id="009009" >9</span>
 “From a country very far away,” they said, “and we have come on account of the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, your God, for we have heard of his fame, of all he did in Egypt, <span class="verse" rel="v006009010" id="009010" >10</span>
 and of all he did to the two Amorite kings east of the Jordan, King Sihon of Heshbon and King Og of Bashan who reigned at Ashtaroth. <span class="verse" rel="v006009011" id="009011" >11</span>
 Our elders and all our people told us to take provisions with us for the journey and to go and meet you and say, ‘We are at your service. Please make a treaty with us.’ <span class="verse" rel="v006009012" id="009012" >12</span>
 This bread we took hot out of our houses on the day we started, and there, you see, it is dry and crumbling by this time! <span class="verse" rel="v006009013" id="009013" >13</span>
 These wineskins were new when we filled them, and you see they are torn. These clothes and shoes of ours are worn out, owing to the long journey.” <span class="verse" rel="v006009014" id="009014" >14</span>
 So the Israelites tried some of their provisions, never asking the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  for advice. <span class="verse" rel="v006009015" id="009015" >15</span>
 Joshua made peace with them and made a treaty with them to spare their lives, and the leaders of the community swore an oath to them. <span class="verse" rel="v006009016" id="009016" >16</span>
 Three days after they had made the treaty, they heard that the men were neighbours, living in the same country! <span class="verse" rel="v006009017" id="009017" >17</span>
 On the third day, as the Israelites marched forward, they came to their towns, Gibeon, Kefirah, Beeroth, and Kiriath Jearim. <span class="verse" rel="v006009018" id="009018" >18</span>
 The Israelites did not kill them, because the leaders of the community had sworn an oath to them by the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, the God of Israel. The community all grumbled against the leaders, <span class="verse" rel="v006009019" id="009019" >19</span>
 but the leaders all replied, “We swore an oath to them by the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  the God of Israel! We cannot touch them now. <span class="verse" rel="v006009020" id="009020" >20</span>
 We must grant them the favour of their lives, or wrath will come upon us over the oath we took to them. <span class="verse" rel="v006009021" id="009021" >21</span>
 Let them live,” said the leaders. So they became woodcutters and watercarriers to all the community, as the leaders directed. <span class="verse" rel="v006009022" id="009022" >22</span>
 Then Joshua called for them and asked them, “Why have you deceived us by saying you came from far, far away, when you live in the same country as ourselves? <span class="verse" rel="v006009023" id="009023" >23</span>
 A curse on you! You will forever provide us with slaves for the temple of my God, woodcutters and watercarriers.” <span class="verse" rel="v006009024" id="009024" >24</span>
 They answered Joshua, “It was because we, your servants, were assured that the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  your God had ordered his servant Moses to assign you all the land and to destroy all the people living in it. That put us in terror of our lives before you, and so we did this. <span class="verse" rel="v006009025" id="009025" >25</span>
 Well, we are in your power! Whatever you think right and fair to do to us, do it.” <span class="verse" rel="v006009026" id="009026" >26</span>
 This then, was how Joshua treated them: he saved them from the Israelites and kept them from being murdered, <span class="verse" rel="v006009027" id="009027" >27</span>
 but he made them that day woodcutters and watercarriers for the community and for the altar of the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, wherever the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  chooses. As they still are. 
<!-- 010 027 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="010001">10</span> When King Adoni-zedek of Jerusalem heard that Joshua had captured Ai and sacked it, treating Ai and its king as he had treated Jericho and its king, and that the citizens of Gibeon had made terms with Israel, <span class="verse" rel="v006010002" id="010002" >2</span>
 he and his men were in terror. For Gibeon was a large town, like a royal city, larger than Ai, and all its men were stout fighters. <span class="verse" rel="v006010003" id="010003" >3</span>
 So King Adoni-zedek of Jerusalem sent to Hoham the king of Hebron, to Piram the king of Jarmuth, to Japhia the king of Lachish, and to Debir the king of Eglon, saying, <span class="verse" rel="v006010004" id="010004" >4</span>
 “Join me and help me to storm Gibeon, for it has made terms with Joshua and the Israelites.” <span class="verse" rel="v006010005" id="010005" >5</span>
 So the five Amorite kings – the king of Jerusalem and the king of Hebron and the king of Jarmuth and the king of Lachish and the king of Eglon – all mustered and marched up with all their armies to besiege Gibeon and attack it. <span class="verse" rel="v006010006" id="010006" >6</span>
 The Gibeonites sent a message to Joshua at the camp in Gilgal, telling him, “Don’t abandon your servants! Quick, come up to rescue us, help us, for all the Amorite kings of the highlands have mustered to attack us.” <span class="verse" rel="v006010007" id="010007" >7</span>
 Joshua marched up from Gilgal with all the troops and all the veterans. <span class="verse" rel="v006010008" id="010008" >8</span>
 The  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  said to Joshua, “Don’t be afraid of them, for I put them into your hands. Not a man of them will hold his own against you.” <span class="verse" rel="v006010009" id="010009" >9</span>
 So Joshua made a sudden attack: he made a night march from Gilgal, <span class="verse" rel="v006010010" id="010010" >10</span>
 and the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  threw them into a panic before the Israelites, until the Israelites routed them with heavy slaughter at Gibeon and then chased them along the road to the ascent of Beth-horon, routing them all the way to Azekah and Makkedah. <span class="verse" rel="v006010011" id="010011" >11</span>
 As they ran from the Israelites, at the descent from Beth-horon the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  rained huge hailstones from heaven upon them, all the way to Azekah. They died of these. Indeed, more died by the hailstones than by the swords of the Israelites. 
<!-- 010 011 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v006010012" id="010012" >12</span>
 It was on the day when the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  handed over the Amorites to the Israelites that Joshua said to the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  before Israel, 
<p class="indent1">  “Sun, stand still over Gibeon! 
<p class="indent2">  Move not, moon, from Aijalon vale!” 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v006010013" id="010013" >13</span>
 And the sun stood still, 
<p class="indent2">  the moon moved not, 
<p class="indent1">  until the nation had taken vengeance on their enemies, 
<!-- 010 013 -->


<p>  (Isn’t this the song written in the book of Jashar? <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">       or   the Book of the Upright </span>  ) The sun stood still in the middle of the sky, and was in no hurry to set for nearly a day. <span class="verse" rel="v006010014" id="010014" >14</span>
 Never was there a day like that, before or since, when the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  listened to the cry of a mortal man. For the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  was fighting for Israel. <span class="verse" rel="v006010015" id="010015" >15</span>
 Then Joshua returned with all the Israelites to the camp at Gilgal. 
<!-- 010 015 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v006010016" id="010016" >16</span>
 The five kings fled, and hid themselves in the cave at Makkedah. <span class="verse" rel="v006010017" id="010017" >17</span>
 When Joshua was told that the five kings had been discovered, hiding in the cave at Makkedah, <span class="verse" rel="v006010018" id="010018" >18</span>
 he said, “Roll some large stones at the mouth of the cave and post men to guard it, <span class="verse" rel="v006010019" id="010019" >19</span>
 but you must not stop pursuing your enemies. Strike down their rear, let none of them get into their towns, for the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  has put them into your power.” <span class="verse" rel="v006010020" id="010020" >20</span>
 When Joshua and the Israelites had finished slaughtering them, until they were wiped out, and the survivors had got away into the fortified towns, <span class="verse" rel="v006010021" id="010021" >21</span>
 the army all safely returned to Joshua at the camp at Makkedah. And no one from that area dared say a word against any of the Israelites. <span class="verse" rel="v006010022" id="010022" >22</span>
 Then Joshua ordered the mouth of the cave to be opened and the five kings brought out to him. <span class="verse" rel="v006010023" id="010023" >23</span>
 This was done. The five kings were brought out, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon. <span class="verse" rel="v006010024" id="010024" >24</span>
 When these kings had been brought before Joshua, he called for all the men of Israel and told the army commanders present to come forward and put their feet on the necks of the kings. They came forward and did put their feet on the necks of the kings. <span class="verse" rel="v006010025" id="010025" >25</span>
 “Don’t be afraid,” said Joshua, “neither be dismayed. Be firm and brave, for so will the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  treat all the enemies against whom you fight.” <span class="verse" rel="v006010026" id="010026" >26</span>
 Then Joshua struck them and killed them. He hung their bodies on five trees, and on the trees they remained hanging until evening. <span class="verse" rel="v006010027" id="010027" >27</span>
 At sunset Joshua ordered the kings’ bodies to be taken down from the trees and thrown into the cave where they had hidden themselves. Some large stones were laid at the mouth of the cave, and are there to this day. <span class="verse" rel="v006010028" id="010028" >28</span>
 The same day Joshua stormed and sacked Makkedah, killing its king and utterly destroying it and all it contained, until not a single person was left. He treated the king of Makkedah as he had treated the king of Jericho, <span class="verse" rel="v006010029" id="010029" >29</span>
 From Makkedah Joshua and all Israel passed on to Libnah. They attacked Libnah, <span class="verse" rel="v006010030" id="010030" >30</span>
 and the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  put Libnah and its king also into the hands of Israel. Joshua sacked the place and massacred all within it, leaving not a single person alive. He treated the king of Libnah as he had treated the king of Jericho. <span class="verse" rel="v006010031" id="010031" >31</span>
 From Libnah, Joshua and the Israelites went on to Lachish, besieged it and attacked it. <span class="verse" rel="v006010032" id="010032" >32</span>
 The  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  put Lachish and its king also into their hands, and on the second day Joshua captured it, sacking it and massacring all within it, as he had done to Libnah. <span class="verse" rel="v006010033" id="010033" >33</span>
 King Horam of Gezer advanced to relieve Lachish, but Joshua defeated him and his army until not a survivor was left to him. <span class="verse" rel="v006010034" id="010034" >34</span>
 From Lachish Joshua and all the Israelites continued on to Eglon, besieged it and attacked it, <span class="verse" rel="v006010035" id="010035" >35</span>
 and captured it the same day. They sacked the place and massacred everyone within it, exactly as he had done to Lachish. <span class="verse" rel="v006010036" id="010036" >36</span>
 From Eglon Joshua and the Israelite army passed on to Hebron and attacked it. <span class="verse" rel="v006010037" id="010037" >37</span>
 They captured it and sacked it, killed the king, destroyed the townships and every living person in them, leaving not one alive, exactly as at Eglon. He wiped the place out and everyone within it. <span class="verse" rel="v006010038" id="010038" >38</span>
 Then Joshua and the Israelites wheeled round to Debir and attacked it. <span class="verse" rel="v006010039" id="010039" >39</span>
 He captured it with its king and all its townships, sacking them all and massacring every living person, until not one remained. As he had treated Hebron, so he treated Debir and its king, just as he had treated Libnah and its king. 
<!-- 010 039 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v006010040" id="010040" >40</span>
 Thus Joshua captured the whole country, the highlands, the Negeb, the lowlands, and the slopes, with all their kings. He left no one alive, but massacred every living creature, as the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, the God of Israel, had commanded. <span class="verse" rel="v006010041" id="010041" >41</span>
 Joshua routed them all from Kadesh-barnea to Gaza, with all the land of Goshen, as far as Gibeon. <span class="verse" rel="v006010042" id="010042" >42</span>
 All these kings and their country Joshua captured in a single campaign, because the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, the God of Israel, fought for Israel. <span class="verse" rel="v006010043" id="010043" >43</span>
 Then Joshua and the Israelites returned to camp at Gilgal. 
<!-- 011 043 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="011001">11</span> When Jabin the king of Hazor heard this, he sent to King Jobab of Madon and to the kings of Shimron and Achshaph <span class="verse" rel="v006011002" id="011002" >2</span>
 and to the kings in the north, in the highlands, in the Arabah south of Chinneroth, in the lowlands, and in Naphoth-Dor to the west, <span class="verse" rel="v006011003" id="011003" >3</span>
 to the Canaanites on the east and on the west, to the Amorites, the Hivites, the Perizzites, and the Jebusites in the highlands, and to the Hittites at the foot of Hermon in the land of Mizpah. <span class="verse" rel="v006011004" id="011004" >4</span>
 They all sallied out, with all their forces, a huge host, as numerous as the sand on the seashore, with a multitude of horses and chariots. <span class="verse" rel="v006011005" id="011005" >5</span>
 All these kings joined forces and went to encamp at the waters of Merom, to attack Israel. <span class="verse" rel="v006011006" id="011006" >6</span>
 But the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  said to Joshua, “Do not be afraid of them. Tomorrow about this time I will hand them over to Israel all dead men. You will hamstring their horses and burn their chariots.” <span class="verse" rel="v006011007" id="011007" >7</span>
 Joshua and all his troops made a sudden attack upon them beside the waters of Merom. They made an onset, <span class="verse" rel="v006011008" id="011008" >8</span>
 and the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  put them into the hands of Israel, who routed them, chasing them to Great Sidon and Misrephoth-maim and the valley of Mizpeh eastward. They routed them and left not one alive. <span class="verse" rel="v006011009" id="011009" >9</span>
 Joshua treated them as the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  instructed him. He hamstrung their horses and burned their chariots. <span class="verse" rel="v006011010" id="011010" >10</span>
 Joshua then wheeled round and captured Hazor, cutting down the king of the place (for Hazor was formerly the most powerful of these realms). <span class="verse" rel="v006011011" id="011011" >11</span>
 They massacred everyone in the place, wiping them out, until not a living person was left, and Hazor was burned to the ground. <span class="verse" rel="v006011012" id="011012" >12</span>
 All the towns of these kings and all the kings themselves Joshua captured and massacred, wiping them all out, as Moses the servant of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  had ordered. <span class="verse" rel="v006011013" id="011013" >13</span>
 (Towns standing on their own mounds of earth, however, the Israelites did not burn, except Hazor alone, which Joshua burned.) <span class="verse" rel="v006011014" id="011014" >14</span>
 All the spoil and cattle of these towns the Israelites took for themselves. But they massacred all the people until they were wiped out, and not a living person was left. <span class="verse" rel="v006011015" id="011015" >15</span>
 As the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  had commanded Moses his servant, so Moses had commanded Joshua, and Joshua obeyed. Of all that the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  had commanded Moses, Joshua left not a thing undone. <span class="verse" rel="v006011016" id="011016" >16</span>
 In this way Joshua captured all that country, the highlands, all the Negeb, all the land of Goshen, the lowlands, the Arabah, the highlands and the lowlands of Israel, <span class="verse" rel="v006011017" id="011017" >17</span>
 from Mount Halak that rises to Seir, as far as to Baal-gad in the valley of Lebanon at the foot of Mount Hermon. He captured all the kings and put them to death. <span class="verse" rel="v006011018" id="011018" >18</span>
 Joshua waged war with all these kings for a long time. <span class="verse" rel="v006011019" id="011019" >19</span>
 Not a single town would make peace with the Israelites, except the Hivites who inhabited Gibeon. All the rest had to be captured by fighting. <span class="verse" rel="v006011020" id="011020" >20</span>
 It was the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  who made their hearts stubborn enough to battle with Israel, so they were all wiped out, destroyed without mercy as the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  had commanded Moses. <span class="verse" rel="v006011021" id="011021" >21</span>
 It was then that Joshua went and wiped out the Anakim from the hills, from Hebron, Debir, Anab, and all the highlands of Israel and of Judah. Joshua massacred them and sacked their towns. <span class="verse" rel="v006011022" id="011022" >22</span>
 None of the Anakim was left in the land of Israel. It was only in Gaza, Gath, and Ashdod, that some still lived. <span class="verse" rel="v006011023" id="011023" >23</span>
 In this way Joshua captured the whole country, as the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  had told Moses. Joshua assigned it to the tribes of Israel by their divisions as their own property. And so the land had rest from war. 
<!-- 012 023 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="012001">12</span> The following are the kings of the country who were routed by the Israelites and whose land was seized east of the Jordan from the Arnon Gorge east to Mount Hermon, with all the Arabah eastward: <span class="verse" rel="v006012002" id="012002" >2</span>
 King Sihon of the Amorites, who lived at Heshbon and ruled from Aroer on the edge of the Arnon Gorge and over half of Giliad – down the gorge as far as the Jabbok River, which is the frontier of the Ammonites, <span class="verse" rel="v006012003" id="012003" >3</span>

 These kings were routed by Moses the servant of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  and the Israelites.

 The following are the kings whom Joshua and the Israelites routed west of the Jordan, from Baal-gad in the valley of Lebanon to Mount Halak that rises to Seir.

<h6>The Division of the Land Among the Tribes of Israel</h6>
<!-- 013 024 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="013001">13</span> When Joshua was old, well advanced in years, the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  said to him, “You are old, well advanced in years, and yet much land still remains to be occupied. <span class="verse" rel="v006013002" id="013002" >2</span>
 This is the land still left to be occupied: all the Philistine districts and all the Geshurite territory <span class="verse" rel="v006013003" id="013003" >3</span>
 from Shibor east of Egypt to the northern frontier of Ekron (which is counted Canaanite), the five Philistine capitals, Gaza, Ashdod, Ashkelon, Gath, and Ekron, also the territory of the Avim <span class="verse" rel="v006013004" id="013004" >4</span>
 to the south, all the Canaanite country from Mearah (which is Sideonian) as far as Aphek on the Amorite frontier, <span class="verse" rel="v006013005" id="013005" >5</span>
 the land of the Gebalites and all that borders on the eastern Lebanon, from Baal-gad at the foot of Mount Hermon to Lebo-hamath, <span class="verse" rel="v006013006" id="013006" >6</span>
 with everyone who lives in the highlands from Lebanon to Misrephoth-maim, all the Sidonians, whom I will evict before the Israelites, while you must allot this country to Israel as its inheritance, as I command you. <span class="verse" rel="v006013007" id="013007" >7</span>
 Now, then, divide up this land of Canaan among the nine tribes and the half tribe of Manasseh as their inheritance.” <span class="verse" rel="v006013008" id="013008" >8</span>
 The other half of the tribe of Manasseh, the Reubenites, and the Gadites, had already received their inheritance from Moses to the east of the Jordan, as assigned by Moses the servant of the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, <span class="verse" rel="v006013009" id="013009" >9</span>
 stretching from Aroer on the edge of the Arnon Gorge and the town in the middle of the gorge, all the tableland of Medeba as far as Dibon, <span class="verse" rel="v006013010" id="013010" >10</span>
 with all the towns of King Sihon of the Amorites who reigned in Heshbon, as far as the frontier of the Ammonites, <span class="verse" rel="v006013011" id="013011" >11</span>
 with Gilead, the territory of the Geshurites and the Maacathites, all Mount Hermon and all Bashan as far as Salecah, <span class="verse" rel="v006013012" id="013012" >12</span>
 all the realm of King Og of Bashan who reigned in Ashtaroth and in Edrei (a survivor of the Rephaim) – these kings Moses defeated and drove out, <span class="verse" rel="v006013013" id="013013" >13</span>
 though the Israelites never expelled the Geshurites or the Maacathites, who live among the Israelites to this day. <span class="verse" rel="v006013014" id="013014" >14</span>
 Only the tribe of Levi were assigned no property, for the Levites’ inheritance is the sacrificial offerings made by fire to the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  God of Israel, as he told Moses. <span class="verse" rel="v006013015" id="013015" >15</span>
 Moses assigned land to the tribe of Reuben by their clans. <span class="verse" rel="v006013016" id="013016" >16</span>
 Their frontier ran from Aroer on the edge of the Arnon Gorge and the town in the middle of the gorge, covering all the tableland near Medeba, <span class="verse" rel="v006013017" id="013017" >17</span>
 Heshbon, and all its townships on the tableland, Dibon, Bamoth-baal, Beth-baal-meon, <span class="verse" rel="v006013018" id="013018" >18</span>
 Jahaz, Kedemoth, Mephaath, <span class="verse" rel="v006013019" id="013019" >19</span>
 Kiriathaim, Sibmah, and Zereth-shahar on the hill of the valley, <span class="verse" rel="v006013020" id="013020" >20</span>
 Beth-peor, the slopes of Pisgah, Beth-jeshimoth, <span class="verse" rel="v006013021" id="013021" >21</span>
 that is, all the towns on the tableland, all the realm of Sihon, the Amorite king who reigned in Heshbon and was defeated by Moses along with the Midianite leaders Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur, and Reba, Sihon’s princes throughout the land. <span class="verse" rel="v006013022" id="013022" >22</span>
 Balaam the son of Beor, who used magic to divine the future, was also slaughtered by the Israelites among the rest of the slain. <span class="verse" rel="v006013023" id="013023" >23</span>
 The bank of the Jordan formed the western frontier of the Reubenites. Such was their allotted country, with its towns and villages, according to their clans. <span class="verse" rel="v006013024" id="013024" >24</span>
 Moses also assigned land to the tribe of Gad according to their clans. <span class="verse" rel="v006013025" id="013025" >25</span>
 Their territory was Jazer, all the towns of Gilead, and half the country of the Ammonites, as far as Aroer east of Rabbah. <span class="verse" rel="v006013026" id="013026" >26</span>
 It reached from Heshbon to Ramath-mizpeh and Betonim, from Mahanaim to the district of Lidebir, <span class="verse" rel="v006013027" id="013027" >27</span>
 with Beth-haram, Beth-nimrah, Succoth, and Zaphon in the valley, the rest of the realm of King Sihon of Heshbon, the frontier being the line of the Jordan to the south end of the lake of Chinnereth on the east of the Jordan. <span class="verse" rel="v006013028" id="013028" >28</span>
 Such was the allotted territory of the Gadites, with its towns and villages, according to their clans. <span class="verse" rel="v006013029" id="013029" >29</span>
 Moses also assigned land to the half tribe of Manasseh, according to its clans. <span class="verse" rel="v006013030" id="013030" >30</span>
 Their territory covered Mahanaim, all Bashan, all the realm of King Og of Bashan, all Havvoth-jair in Bashan (sixty towns in all), <span class="verse" rel="v006013031" id="013031" >31</span>
 half of Gilead, with Ashtaroth and Edrei, the towns of King Og of Bashan. All this was for the descendants of Machir, who was the son of Manasseh, for the half tribe of the Machirites by their clans. <span class="verse" rel="v006013032" id="013032" >32</span>
 Such were the properties allotted by Moses in the plains of Moab to the east of the Jordan, opposite Jericho. <span class="verse" rel="v006013033" id="013033" >33</span>
 Only to the tribe of Levi he assigned no property, for the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, the God of Israel, is Levi’s inheritance, as he told Moses. 
<!-- 014 033 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="014001">14</span> And these are the properties occupied in Canaan by the Israelites, and assigned to them by lot as their own, by Eleazar the priest and Joshua the son of Nun and the heads of the households in the tribes of Israel, <span class="verse" rel="v006014002" id="014002" >2</span>
 as the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  had commanded by Moses, for the nine and a half tribes. <span class="verse" rel="v006014003" id="014003" >3</span>
 Moses had assigned the other two and a half tribes their property and inheritance to the east of the Jordan, and assigned nothing to the Levites. <span class="verse" rel="v006014004" id="014004" >4</span>
 The two tribes of the Josephites were Manasseh and Ephraim. The Levites received no share of the land, except some towns to live in, with their pastures for cattle and livestock. <span class="verse" rel="v006014005" id="014005" >5</span>
 The Israelites, in dividing up the land, acted according to the orders given by the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  to Moses. <span class="verse" rel="v006014006" id="014006" >6</span>
 The Judahites came before Joshua at Gilgal, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite said to him, “You know what the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  said to Moses the man of God about me and yourself at Kadesh-barnea. <span class="verse" rel="v006014007" id="014007" >7</span>
 I was forty years old when Moses the servant of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  sent me from Kadesh-barnea to spy out the country, and I reported to him as best I could. <span class="verse" rel="v006014008" id="014008" >8</span>
 My kinsmen and companions made the heart of the people tremble, but I was devoted to the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  my God, <span class="verse" rel="v006014009" id="014009" >9</span>
 and Moses swore that day that the land my feet had trodden should belong to me and to my children for all time, because I had been devoted to the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  my God. <span class="verse" rel="v006014010" id="014010" >10</span>
 Well now, the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  has kept me alive as he promised, all these forty-five years, ever since the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  said that word to Moses, all the time of Israel’s wandering in the desert. Today I am eighty-five, <span class="verse" rel="v006014011" id="014011" >11</span>
 11 and I am as strong today as I was when Moses sent me on that mission. As my strength was then, so my strength is now, for war or any enterprise. <span class="verse" rel="v006014012" id="014012" >12</span>
 So let me have this hill country of which the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  spoke that day. As you heard that day, the Anakim are there with great, fortified towns. But perhaps the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  will be with me and I will evict them, as he promised.” <span class="verse" rel="v006014013" id="014013" >13</span>
 So Joshua blessed him, and gave Hebron to Caleb the son of Jephunneh as his property. <span class="verse" rel="v006014014" id="014014" >14</span>
 Hebron became the property of Caleb the son of Jephunneh, the Kenizzite, and still is in his family – for he was devoted to the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, the God of Israel. <span class="verse" rel="v006014015" id="014015" >15</span>
 Hebron was formerly called Kiriath-arba, or the city of Arba, Arba being the greatest among the Anakim. So the land had rest from war. 
<!-- 015 015 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="015001">15</span> The land allotted to the tribe of Judah, by clans, reached to the frontier of Edom, far south to the desert of Zin. <span class="verse" rel="v006015002" id="015002" >2</span>
 The southern frontier ran from the foot of the Dead Sea, from the bay facing south. <span class="verse" rel="v006015003" id="015003" >3</span>
 It went south of the Ascent of Akrabbim, right along to Zin, then up to the south of Kadesh-barnea as far as Hezron, up to Adar, round to Karka, <span class="verse" rel="v006015004" id="015004" >4</span>
 and on to Azmon, ending at the Stream of Egypt. Their southern frontier thus ended at the sea. <span class="verse" rel="v006015005" id="015005" >5</span>
 To the east their frontier was the Dead Sea up to the mouth of the Jordan. The northern frontier ran from the bay at the mouth of the Jordan <span class="verse" rel="v006015006" id="015006" >6</span>
 up to Beth-hoglah and north of Beth-arabah, on to the Stone of Bohan, who was Reuben’s son, <span class="verse" rel="v006015007" id="015007" >7</span>
 then to Debir from the valley of Achor and so north in the direction of Gilgal opposite the ascent to Adummim on the south side of the river, then along to the waters of En-shemesh, ending at En-rogel. <span class="verse" rel="v006015008" id="015008" >8</span>
 Then the frontier ran by the valley of Ben-Hinnom to the southern side of the Jebusite ridge (that is, Jerusalem), westward to the top of the hill that lies in front of the valley of Ben-Hinnom at the northern end of the valley of Rephaim. <span class="verse" rel="v006015009" id="015009" >9</span>
 From the top of this hill it ran to the spring of the Waters of Nephtoah and on to the towns of Mount Ephron. It also extended to Baalah (that is, Kiriath-jearim) <span class="verse" rel="v006015010" id="015010" >10</span>
 and west of Baalah round to Mount Seir, going on to the north of the ridge of Mount Jeadrim (that is, Chesalon), down to Beth-shemesh, and on to Timnah. <span class="verse" rel="v006015011" id="015011" >11</span>
 It ran on to the ridge of Ekron on the north, extending to Shikkeron and on to Mount Baalah, ending at Jabneel. Thus the frontier ended at the sea. <span class="verse" rel="v006015012" id="015012" >12</span>
 The western frontier was the Mediterranean. Such were the entire frontiers of the Judahites, by their clans. <span class="verse" rel="v006015013" id="015013" >13</span>
 He allotted Caleb the son of Jephunneh a share among the Judahites, by order of the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>. It was Kiriath-arba or the city of Arba (Arba being the father of Anak), otherwise Hebron. <span class="verse" rel="v006015014" id="015014" >14</span>
 Caleb drove out the three groups of of Anakites, the Sheshai, Ahiman, and Talmai, who were the descendants of Anak. <span class="verse" rel="v006015015" id="015015" >15</span>
 Then he marched against the people living in Debir (formerly called Kiriath-sepher). <span class="verse" rel="v006015016" id="015016" >16</span>
 Caleb declared, “Whoever attacks Kiriath-sepher and captures it, I will give him my daughter Achsah in marriage.” <span class="verse" rel="v006015017" id="015017" >17</span>
 Othniel, the son of Caleb’s brother Kenaz, captured it. So Caleb gave him his daughter Achsah in marriage. <span class="verse" rel="v006015018" id="015018" >18</span>
 On the wedding day, Othniel induced her <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">       Heb. uncertain. </span>  to ask her father for a tract of land as her dowry. So she alighted from her donkey, and when Caleb asked her what she wanted, <span class="verse" rel="v006015019" id="015019" >19</span>
 she said to him, “Give me a parting present. As you have settled me in the dry south country, let me have some springs of water.” Then Caleb gave her the upper springs and the lower springs.

<p><span class="chapter" id="016001">16</span> The land allotted to the Josephites had a frontier starting from the Jordan at Jericho, east of the Waters of Jericho, near the desert, extending from Jericho up through the highlands to Bethel, <span class="verse" rel="v006016002" id="016002" >2</span>
 then from Bethel to Luz, and along to Ataroth on the frontier of the Archites, <span class="verse" rel="v006016003" id="016003" >3</span>

 They did not evict the Canaanites who lived in Gezer. The Canaanites lived among the Ephraimites, as they do to this day, though they have had to slave for them.

Manasseh was the eldest son of Joseph, and as Machir the eldest son of Manasseh and the father of Gilead was a famous soldier, he was allotted Gilead and Bashan. <span class="verse" rel="v006017002" id="017002" >2</span>
 The rest of the Manassites, according to their clans, were the descendants of Abiezer, Helek, Asriel, Shechem, Hepher and Shemida, the male descendants of Manasseh the son of Joseph. <span class="verse" rel="v006017003" id="017003" >3</span>
 However, Zelophehad the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, had no sons, only daughters. His daughters were called Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah. <span class="verse" rel="v006017004" id="017004" >4</span>
 They came before Eleazar the priest and Joshua the son of Nun and the chiefs, urging that the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  had told Moses to grant them an inheritance along with their male relatives. So, as the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  had ordered, Joshua gave them an inheritance among the relatives of their father. <span class="verse" rel="v006017005" id="017005" >5</span>
 Ten shares fell to Manasseh, apart from the land of Gilead and Bashan on the east of the Jordan <span class="verse" rel="v006017006" id="017006" >6</span>
 (because the daughters of Manasseh inherited along with their male relatives, and the rest of the descendants of Manasseh held the land of Gilead). <span class="verse" rel="v006017007" id="017007" >7</span>
 The frontier of Manasseh ran from Asher to Michmethah east of Shechem, then south to the people living in En-tappuah <span class="verse" rel="v006017008" id="017008" >8</span>
 (the land of Tappuah belonging to Manasseh, but Tappuah on the frontier of Manasseh belonging to Ephraim). <span class="verse" rel="v006017009" id="017009" >9</span>
 The frontier went down to the south of the Kanah Valley these towns belonged to Ephraim among the towns of Manasseh, then ran along the north side of the valley as far as the sea, <span class="verse" rel="v006017010" id="017010" >10</span>
 the land to the south being Ephraim’s and the land to the north belonging to Manasseh, with the sea as the frontier to the west. They stretched to Asher on the north and to Issachar on the east. <span class="verse" rel="v006017011" id="017011" >11</span>
 In Issachar and Asher Manasseh held Beth-shean and its townships, Ibleam and its townships, the people living in Dor and its townships (the three heights of Dor), the people living in En-dor and its townships, the people living in Taanach and its townships, the people living in Megiddo and its townships <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">       Heb. uncertain. </span> . <span class="verse" rel="v006017012" id="017012" >12</span>
 But the Manassites could not evict the people of these towns. The Canaanites clung to this country. <span class="verse" rel="v006017013" id="017013" >13</span>
 When Israel became a power, they forced the Canaanites to slave for them. They never evicted them entirely. 
<!-- 017 013 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v006017014" id="017014" >14</span>
 Then the Josephites complained to Joshua, “Why have you allotted us only one part as our inheritance, when we are a large tribe, since the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  has been prospering us?” <span class="verse" rel="v006017015" id="017015" >15</span>
 Joshua replied, “If there are so many of you, go up to the Forest and clear land for yourselves there, among the Perizzites and the Rephaim, if the highlands of Ephraim are too small for you.” <span class="verse" rel="v006017016" id="017016" >16</span>
 “The highlands are not large enough for us,” said the Josephites, “and all the Canaanites who live in the valley country have iron chariots, both the people of Beth-shean and its townships and those who live in the valley of Jezreel.” <span class="verse" rel="v006017017" id="017017" >17</span>
 Then Joshua said to the Josephites, to Ephraim and Manasseh, “You are a numerous tribe, and a powerful tribe, so you will have more than one part allotted to you. <span class="verse" rel="v006017018" id="017018" >18</span>
 The hill country of Gilead will be yours, for though it is a Forest you will clear it and hold it to its full extent. For you will evict the Canaanites, though they do have iron chariots and though they are strong.” 
<!-- 018 018 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="018001">18</span> Then the whole community of the Israelites, having subdued the country, met at Shilo and set up the Tent of Meeting there. <span class="verse" rel="v006018002" id="018002" >2</span>
 As there were still seven tribes of Israel which had not yet divided their inheritance, <span class="verse" rel="v006018003" id="018003" >3</span>
 Joshua said to the Israelites, “How long will you delay to enter and occupy the land which the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, the God of your ancestors, has given you? <span class="verse" rel="v006018004" id="018004" >4</span>
 Appoint three men from each tribe. I will send them to make a survey of the land showing the proposed areas for their inheritance. Then they are to come back to me. <span class="verse" rel="v006018005" id="018005" >5</span>
 They must divide it into seven parts, with Judah in the southern territory and Joseph in the northern. <span class="verse" rel="v006018006" id="018006" >6</span>
 Mark out the land into seven divisions and bring me the plan. Then I will draw lots for you here before the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  our God. <span class="verse" rel="v006018007" id="018007" >7</span>
 The Levites do not share with you. Their share is the priesthood of the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>. Gad and Reuben and the half tribe of Manasseh have already received their inheritance on the east of the Jordan, assigned them by Moses the servant of the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>.” <span class="verse" rel="v006018008" id="018008" >8</span>
 Then the men started, ordered by Joshua to travel through the land and map it out before they returned to him. Then he would draw lots for them before the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  at Shilo. <span class="verse" rel="v006018009" id="018009" >9</span>
 The men went and traversed the country, mapping it out by towns into seven parts, and brought their written report to Joshua at the camp in Shilo. <span class="verse" rel="v006018010" id="018010" >10</span>
 Joshua then drew lots for them at Shilo before the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, where he divided the land for the Israelites according to their divisions. 
<!-- 018 010 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v006018011" id="018011" >11</span>
 When the lot was drawn for the tribe of the Benjamites according to their clans, the territory allotted to them was to lie between the Judahites and the Josephites. <span class="verse" rel="v006018012" id="018012" >12</span>
 Their frontier on the north stretched from the Jordan to the north of Jericho right through the highlands westward, ending at the desert of Beth-aven. <span class="verse" rel="v006018013" id="018013" >13</span>
 Then the frontier ran to Luz, passing below Luz (which is Bethel) to the south, down to Ataroth-addar near the hill that lies south of Lower Beth-horon. <span class="verse" rel="v006018014" id="018014" >14</span>
 The frontier then turned from the hill south of Lower Beth-horon and passed on to the south along the west, ending at Kiriath-baal (which is Kiriath-jearim), a Judahite town. This was the western frontier. <span class="verse" rel="v006018015" id="018015" >15</span>
 The southern stretched from the end of Kiriath-jearim westward on to the spring of the Waters of Nephtoah, <span class="verse" rel="v006018016" id="018016" >16</span>

 where it turned north and ran to En-shemesh, passing to Geliloth opposite the ascent to Adummim, from which it ran to the Stone of Bohan (who was Reuben’s son) <span class="verse" rel="v006018018" id="018018" >18</span>
 and on to the ridge along the north of the Arabah right down to the Arabah <span class="verse" rel="v006018019" id="018019" >19</span>
 and on to the north of the ridge of Beth-hoglah, ending at the northern bay of the Dead Sea at the southern end of the Jordan. This was the southern frontier. <span class="verse" rel="v006018020" id="018020" >20</span>
 The Jordan was the eastern frontier. Such was the inheritance of the Benjamites according to their clans, frontier by frontier. <span class="verse" rel="v006018021" id="018021" >21</span>
 Their towns were Jericho, Beth-hoglah, Emek-keziz, <span class="verse" rel="v006018022" id="018022" >22</span>

<!-- 020 051 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="020001">20</span> Then the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  told Joshua <span class="verse" rel="v006020002" id="020002" >2</span>
 to tell the Israelites to “Assign the towns of refuge of which I spoke to you by Moses, <span class="verse" rel="v006020003" id="020003" >3</span>
 so that anyone who kills another person by mistake, by accident, may run into one of them. They will serve as a refuge from the vengeance of the dead person’s next of kin. <span class="verse" rel="v006020004" id="020004" >4</span>
 The killer will flee to one of these towns and stand at the entry of the town gate, telling their case to the elders of that town. The elders must let the killer have a place to stay among them, <span class="verse" rel="v006020005" id="020005" >5</span>
 and if the next of kin comes in pursuit, they must not hand the killer over, because they killed their neighbour by accident, having had no feud with them previously. <span class="verse" rel="v006020006" id="020006" >6</span>
 The killer must stay in that town until they appear before the community for trial, and then until the death of the then high priest. After that the killer may return to their own town and their own home, from which they ran away.” 
<!-- 020 006 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v006020007" id="020007" >7</span>
 So they consecrated Kedesh in Galilee, in the highlands of Naphtali, Shechem in the highlands of Ephraim, and Kiriath-arba (that is, Hebron) in the highlands of Judah. <span class="verse" rel="v006020008" id="020008" >8</span>
 On the eastern side of the Jordan they assigned Bezer in the desert, on the tableland belonging to the tribe of Reuben, Ramoth in Gilead from the tribe of Gad, and Golan in Bashan from the tribe of Manasseh. <span class="verse" rel="v006020009" id="020009" >9</span>

 to the descendants of Aaron, the Kohathite families, who were Levites, since the lot fell to them first. <span class="verse" rel="v006021011" id="021011" >11</span>

 These towns of the Levites within the holdings of the Israelites numbered in all forty-eight, with their pastures. <span class="verse" rel="v006021042" id="021042" >42</span>
 Every town had its own pastures round it, every one. 
<!-- 021 042 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v006021043" id="021043" >43</span>
 In this way the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  gave to Israel all the land he had sworn to give to their ancestors. They occupied it and settled in it, <span class="verse" rel="v006021044" id="021044" >44</span>
 and the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  gave them security on every side, exactly as he had sworn to their ancestors. <span class="verse" rel="v006021044" id="021044" >44</span>
 Not one of their enemies could hold their own against them, for the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  put all their enemies into their power. <span class="verse" rel="v006021045" id="021045" >45</span>
 Not one of the good promises made by the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  to the people of Israel failed. All were fulfilled. 
<h6>Epilogue</h6>
<!-- 022 045 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="022001">22</span> Then Joshua summoned the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasseh. <span class="verse" rel="v006022002" id="022002" >2</span>
 He said to them, “You have obeyed everything that Moses the servant of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  ordered you, and listened to what I have said by way of command to you. <span class="verse" rel="v006022003" id="022003" >3</span>
 You have not abandoned your fellow Israelites all this time, but have obeyed the injunctions laid down for you by the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  your God. <span class="verse" rel="v006022004" id="022004" >4</span>
 Now that the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  your God has granted rest to your fellow Israelites, as he promised, you may go home to your tents in the land of your holdings, assigned to you by Moses the servant of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  on the east of the Jordan. <span class="verse" rel="v006022005" id="022005" >5</span>
 Only be most careful to obey the commands and laws laid down for you by Moses the servant of the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, mindful to love the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  your God, always to live his life, to obey his commands, to be loyal to him, and to serve him with all your heart and mind.” <span class="verse" rel="v006022006" id="022006" >6</span>
 So Joshua blessed them and sent them away home. 
<!-- 022 006 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v006022007" id="022007" >7</span>
 To the one half tribe of Manasseh Moses had assigned territory in Bashan, but Joshua assigned the other half territory near the fellow Israelites to the west of the Jordan. When Joshua sent them home he blessed them, <span class="verse" rel="v006022008" id="022008" >8</span>
 and they returned home to their tents with great wealth, rich in cattle, silver and gold, bronze, iron, and a lot of clothing, the plunder of their enemies which they divided among their relatives. 
<!-- 022 008 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v006022009" id="022009" >9</span>
 The Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasseh went home, leaving the Israelites at Shiloh in the land of Canaan, and returning to the land of Gilead which was their holding, assigned them by Moses under orders from the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>. <span class="verse" rel="v006022010" id="022010" >10</span>
 When they reached the region near the Jordon, inside the land of Canaan, the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasseh set up an altar there beside the Jordan, a large conspicuous altar. <span class="verse" rel="v006022011" id="022011" >11</span>
 The Israelites were told that the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasseh had set up an altar at Gilgal, on the western bank belonging to Israel, <span class="verse" rel="v006022012" id="022012" >12</span>
 and on hearing this the whole community of Israel mustered at Shilo to make war upon them. 
<!-- 022 012 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v006022013" id="022013" >13</span>
 The Israelites sent a mission to the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasseh in Gilead, namely, Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, <span class="verse" rel="v006022014" id="022014" >14</span>
 and ten chieftains, each a chieftain of his tribe, a leader of his family among the clans of Israel. <span class="verse" rel="v006022015" id="022015" >15</span>
 They went to Gilead and said to the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasseh, <span class="verse" rel="v006022016" id="022016" >16</span>
 “The whole community of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  asks what you mean by breaking faith with the God of Israel and ceasing now to follow him by setting up an altar for yourselves? This is rebellion against the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>. <span class="verse" rel="v006022017" id="022017" >17</span>
 Was it not enough to sin at Peor? A sin from which we have not even yet cleansed ourselves, though a plague fell upon the community of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  then! <span class="verse" rel="v006022018" id="022018" >18</span>
 And here you cease to follow the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  now! You rebel today against the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, and tomorrow he will be angry with the whole community of Israel. <span class="verse" rel="v006022019" id="022019" >19</span>
 If the land you hold is unclean, then cross over to the land which the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  himself holds, where his dwelling stands, and occupy a holding among us. But do not rebel against the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, do not make us rebels against the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, by setting up for yourselves an altar other than the altar of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  our God. <span class="verse" rel="v006022020" id="022020" >20</span>
 Wasn’t Achan the son of Zerah guilty of a breach of faith in the matter of the spoil which was dedicated to God, until God’s anger fell upon the whole community? He was not the only one to die for his crime.” 
<!-- 022 020 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v006022021" id="022021" >21</span>
 The Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasseh replied to the leaders of Israel: <span class="verse" rel="v006022022" id="022022" >22</span>
 “The Mighty One, God, the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, the Mighty One, God, the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, knows well, and Israel will know, if we were rebels or broke faith (if we did, do not spare us!) <span class="verse" rel="v006022023" id="022023" >23</span>
 when we set up an altar for ourselves, if we meant to cease following the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, or to sacrifice burnt offerings, cereal offerings, and recompense offerings. <span class="verse" rel="v006022024" id="022024" >24</span>
 Let the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  himself punish us, if we did not do this in the fear that, later, descendants might say to our descendants, ‘What relationship do you have with the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  the God of Israel? <span class="verse" rel="v006022025" id="022025" >25</span>
 The  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  made the Jordan the boundary between us and you, you Reubenites and Gadites. You have no share in the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>.’ Your descendants would make descendants give up the religion of the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>. <span class="verse" rel="v006022026" id="022026" >26</span>
 So we thought we would prepare to build an altar for ourselves, not to sacrifice burnt offerings or any sacrifice at all, <span class="verse" rel="v006022027" id="022027" >27</span>
 but to stand as a witness between us and you, and between our descendants and yours, attesting that we are to worship before the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  with our burnt offerings and recompense offerings, so that your descendants may never claim in time to come that we have no share in the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>. <span class="verse" rel="v006022028" id="022028" >28</span>
 If ever that is claimed to us or to our descendants in time to come, we thought the answer would be, ‘There is the replica of the altar of the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, the replica made by our ancestors, though not for burnt offering nor for sacrifice. It stands as a witness between us and you!’ <span class="verse" rel="v006022029" id="022029" >29</span>
 Far be it from us to rebel against the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  and cease now to follow him by setting up any altar for burnt offerings, cereal offerings, or any sacrifice, apart from the altar of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  our God in front of his own Tent.” 
<!-- 022 029 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v006022030" id="022030" >30</span>
 When Phinehas the priest and the leaders of the community, the chieftains of the clans of Israel who were with him, heard what the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the Manassites said, they were quite satisfied. <span class="verse" rel="v006022031" id="022031" >31</span>
 Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest said to the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the Manassites, “Now we know that the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  is among us, since you have not broken faith here with the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>. You have delivered the Israelites from the hand of the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>.” <span class="verse" rel="v006022032" id="022032" >32</span>
 Then Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest and the chieftains left the Reubenites and the Gadites in the land of Gilead and returned to the land of Canaan, and reported the news to the Israelites. <span class="verse" rel="v006022033" id="022033" >33</span>
 The Israelites were satisfied. They blessed God and said no more about waging war against them and destroying the land where the Reubenites and the Gadites lived. <span class="verse" rel="v006022034" id="022034" >34</span>
 The Reubenites and the Gadites named the altar, saying “it is a witness between us that the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  is God.” 
<!-- 023 034 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="023001">23</span> A long time afterwards, when the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  had given Israel rest from all its surrounding enemies, and when Joshua was old, far advanced in years, <span class="verse" rel="v006023002" id="023002" >2</span>
 he summoned all Israel, their elders, their leaders, their judges, and their officers. “I am an old man,” he said, “well advanced in years. <span class="verse" rel="v006023003" id="023003" >3</span>
 You have seen all that the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  your God has done for your sake to all these nations. It is the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  your God who has been fighting for you. <span class="verse" rel="v006023004" id="023004" >4</span>
 I have allotted you to the remaining nations, after those which I have wiped out, and you will hold the land of these nations from the Jordan to the Mediterranean in the west. <span class="verse" rel="v006023005" id="023005" >5</span>
 The  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  your God will drive them out before you and evict them out of your sight, until you occupy their land, as the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  your God promised you. <span class="verse" rel="v006023006" id="023006" >6</span>
 Be resolute, then, in carrying out and obeying all that is written in the law book of Moses, never swerving from it to the right or to the left, <span class="verse" rel="v006023007" id="023007" >7</span>
 never mixing with those nations that remain beside you, never mentioning the names of their gods, never swearing by them nor serving them nor bowing down to them. <span class="verse" rel="v006023008" id="023008" >8</span>
 Be loyal to the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  your God as you have been up until now. <span class="verse" rel="v006023009" id="023009" >9</span>
 The  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  has evicted great, powerful nations in front of you. To this day, no one has been able to hold their own against you. <span class="verse" rel="v006023010" id="023010" >10</span>
 One of you routs a thousand men, for it is the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  your God who fights for you, as he promised you. <span class="verse" rel="v006023011" id="023011" >11</span>
 Be careful, then, always to love the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  your God. <span class="verse" rel="v006023012" id="023012" >12</span>
 Otherwise, if you turn to ally yourselves with the remnant of nations left beside you, and intermarry with them, and join with them and they with you, <span class="verse" rel="v006023013" id="023013" >13</span>
 be sure of this, that the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  your God will no longer evict these nations before your eyes. They will be a danger to you, they will entrap you, they will be a scourge for your sides and thorns in your eyes, until you perish off this fine country which the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  your God has assigned you. <span class="verse" rel="v006023014" id="023014" >14</span>
 I am now going the way of all the earth. But you know in your own hearts and minds, all of you, that not one good promise made by the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  about you has ever failed. All have been fulfilled, and not one has failed. <span class="verse" rel="v006023015" id="023015" >15</span>
 Well, as all the good promises have been fulfilled to you, of which the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  your God told you, so will the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  fulfil all his threats to you until he wipes you off this fine country which the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  your God has given you. <span class="verse" rel="v006023016" id="023016" >16</span>
 Whenever you break the covenant of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  your God, which he has laid upon you, and go to serve other gods, bowing down to them, then will the anger of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  blaze against you, until you perish quickly off the fine country which he has given you.” 
<!-- 024 016 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="024001">24</span> Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to Shechem, summoning the elders of Israel and their leaders, their judges, and their officers. They presented themselves before God, <span class="verse" rel="v006024002" id="024002" >2</span>
 and Joshua said to all the people, “This is the message of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  the God of Israel: In days of old your ancestors lived east of the Euphrates, Terah, the father of Abraham and the father of Nahor, worshipping other gods. <span class="verse" rel="v006024003" id="024003" >3</span>
 But I took your ancestor Abraham from the other side of the Euphrates, I led him through all the land of Canaan, multiplying his family, and giving him Isaac. <span class="verse" rel="v006024004" id="024004" >4</span>
 To Isaac I gave Jacob and Esau. To Esau I gave Mount Seir as his holding, while Jacob and his sons went down to Egypt. <span class="verse" rel="v006024005" id="024005" >5</span>
 Later I sent Moses and Aaron, and I plagued Egypt with wonders which I wrought among them. Afterwards I brought you out, <span class="verse" rel="v006024006" id="024006" >6</span>
 I brought out your ancestors from Egypt, and when you reached the sea the Egyptians pursued your ancestors with chariots and cavalry as far as the Reed Sea. <span class="verse" rel="v006024007" id="024007" >7</span>
 But when your ancestors cried to the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, he put darkness between you and the Egyptians, and brought the sea over them. You saw with your own eyes what I did in Egypt. You lived many days in the desert, <span class="verse" rel="v006024008" id="024008" >8</span>
 but I brought you to the land of the Amorites on the eastern side of the Jordan, and when they fought you I put them into your hands and you occupied their land, until I destroyed them before you. <span class="verse" rel="v006024009" id="024009" >9</span>
 Then Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, made an attack upon Israel. He sent for Balaam the son of Beer to curse you, <span class="verse" rel="v006024010" id="024010" >10</span>
 but I would not listen to Balaam. He had to bless you instead, and so I saved you from him. <span class="verse" rel="v006024011" id="024011" >11</span>
 You crossed the Jordan and reached Jericho, where the men of Jericho fought you, as did the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Girgashites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites. But I put them all into your hands. <span class="verse" rel="v006024012" id="024012" >12</span>
 I sent panic <span class="rightnotemarker">*</span><span class="rightnote">    Heb. uncertain. Often rendered ’the hornet’ </span>  before you to drive out these nations, even the two kings of the Amorites. It was not your sword nor your bow that beat them. <span class="verse" rel="v006024013" id="024013" >13</span>
 I gave you a land on which you had never laboured, you live in towns you never built, and you now eat from vineyards and olive groves that you never planted. <span class="verse" rel="v006024014" id="024014" >14</span>
 So revere the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  and serve him honestly and loyally, put away the gods your ancestors served on the east of the Euphrates and in Egypt, and serve the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  yourselves. <span class="verse" rel="v006024015" id="024015" >15</span>
 If you are unwilling to serve the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, then choose today whom you will serve, either the gods your ancestors served on the east of the Euphrates or the gods of the Amorites in whose land you are living. But as for me and my house, we will serve the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>.” <span class="verse" rel="v006024016" id="024016" >16</span>
 The people replied, “Far be it from us to forsake the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  and serve other gods! <span class="verse" rel="v006024017" id="024017" >17</span>
 It is the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  our God who has brought us and our ancestors out of the land of Egypt, out of that slave-pen, who wrought these great portents before our eyes, who preserved us wherever we went and among all the nations through whom we passed. <span class="verse" rel="v006024018" id="024018" >18</span>
 The  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  drove out all the nations before us, all the Amorites who lived in the land. So we will serve the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, for he is our God.” <span class="verse" rel="v006024019" id="024019" >19</span>
 Joshua said to the people, “You may not be able to serve the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>. He is a holy God, a jealous God, he will not forgive any sinful disloyalty of yours. <span class="verse" rel="v006024020" id="024020" >20</span>
 If you forsake the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  and serve foreign gods, he will turn to do evil to you and consume you after he has been doing you good.” <span class="verse" rel="v006024021" id="024021" >21</span>
 “No,” said the people, “we will serve the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>.” <span class="verse" rel="v006024022" id="024022" >22</span>
 So Joshua said to the people, “You are witnesses against yourselves that you have chosen the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  to serve him.” “Yes, we are!” they responded. <span class="verse" rel="v006024023" id="024023" >23</span>
 “Then here and now,” he said, “put away the foreign gods which are among you and give your hearts to the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  the God of Israel.” <span class="verse" rel="v006024024" id="024024" >24</span>
 The people answered, “The  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  our God will we serve, and we will listen to his voice.” <span class="verse" rel="v006024025" id="024025" >25</span>
 So Joshua made a covenant that day with the people, fixing rules and laws for them at Shechem. <span class="verse" rel="v006024026" id="024026" >26</span>
 Joshua wrote these terms in the law book of God. He took a large boulder and set it up there under the sacred oak in the sanctuary of the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, <span class="verse" rel="v006024027" id="024027" >27</span>
 saying to all the people, “This stone will be a witness against us, for it has heard all that the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  has said to us. It will be a witness against you if you break faith with your God.” <span class="verse" rel="v006024028" id="024028" >28</span>
 Then Joshua sent the people away home, every man to his own inheritance. <span class="verse" rel="v006024029" id="024029" >29</span>
 After this Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, died, at the age of a hundred and ten. <span class="verse" rel="v006024030" id="024030" >30</span>
 They buried him in his own estate at Timnath-serah in the highlands of Ephraim, north of Mount Gaash.

 The bones of Joseph, which the Israelites had brought up from Egypt, were buried at Shechem in the piece of ground which Jacob had bought for a hundred silver pieces from the sons of Hamer, the father of Shechem, and presented to the descendants of Joseph as their own.

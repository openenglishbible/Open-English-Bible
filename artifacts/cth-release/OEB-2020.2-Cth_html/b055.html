<h2>Paul’s Second Letter to</h2>
<h1>Timothy</h1>
<h6>Introduction</h6>
<!-- 001 001 -->


<p class="smallcappara"><span class="chapter" id="001001">1</span><span class="dropcap">F</span>rom Paul who, by the will of God, is an apostle of Christ Jesus, charged to proclaim the life that comes from union with Christ Jesus, <span class="verse" rel="v055001002" id="001002" >2</span>
 to Timothy, my dear child: may God, the Father, and Christ Jesus, our Lord, bless you, and be merciful to you, and give you peace. <p>
<!-- 001 002 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v055001003" id="001003" >3</span>
 I am thankful to God, whom I serve, as my ancestors did, with a clear conscience, when I remember you, as I never fail to do, in my prayers – night and day alike, <span class="verse" rel="v055001004" id="001004" >4</span>
 as I think of your tears, longing to see you, that my happiness may be completed, <span class="verse" rel="v055001005" id="001005" >5</span>
 now that I have been reminded of the sincere faith that you have shown. That faith was seen first in your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice, and is now, I am convinced, in you also. <span class="verse" rel="v055001006" id="001006" >6</span>
 And that is my reason for reminding you to stir into flame that gift of God, which is yours through your ordination at my hands. <span class="verse" rel="v055001007" id="001007" >7</span>
 For the Spirit which God gave us was not a spirit of cowardice, but a spirit of power, love, and self-control. <span class="verse" rel="v055001008" id="001008" >8</span>
 Do not, therefore, be ashamed of the testimony which we have to bear to our Lord, or of me imprisoned for his sake; but join with me in suffering for the good news, as far as God enables you. <span class="verse" rel="v055001009" id="001009" >9</span>
 It was God who saved us, and from him we received our solemn call – not as a reward for anything that we had done, but in fulfilment of his own loving purpose. For that love was extended to us, through Christ Jesus, before time began, <span class="verse" rel="v055001010" id="001010" >10</span>
 and has now been made apparent through the appearing of our Saviour, Christ Jesus; who has made an end of death, and has brought life and immortality to light by that good news, <span class="verse" rel="v055001011" id="001011" >11</span>
 of which I was myself appointed a herald, apostle, and teacher. <span class="verse" rel="v055001012" id="001012" >12</span>
 That is why I am undergoing these sufferings; yet I feel no shame, for I know in whom I have put my faith, and am convinced that he is able to guard what I have entrusted to him until that day. <span class="verse" rel="v055001013" id="001013" >13</span>
 Keep before you, as an example of sound teaching, all that you learnt from me as you listened with that faith and love which come from union with Christ Jesus. <span class="verse" rel="v055001014" id="001014" >14</span>
 Guard by the help of the Holy Spirit, who is within us, the glorious trust that has been committed to you. 
<!-- 001 014 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v055001015" id="001015" >15</span>
 You know, of course, that all our friends in Roman Asia turned their backs on me, including Phygellus and Hermogenes. <span class="verse" rel="v055001016" id="001016" >16</span>
 May the Lord show mercy to the household of Onesiphorus; for he often cheered me and was not ashamed of my chains. <span class="verse" rel="v055001017" id="001017" >17</span>
 On the contrary, when he arrived in Rome, he sought eagerly for me until he found me. <span class="verse" rel="v055001018" id="001018" >18</span>
 The Lord grant that he may find mercy at the hands of the Lord on that day. The many services that he rendered at Ephesus you have the best means of knowing. 
<h6>Injunctions to Timothy</h6>
<!-- 002 018 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="002001">2</span> You must, then, my child, find strength in the help which comes from the union with Christ Jesus; <span class="verse" rel="v055002002" id="002002" >2</span>
 and what you learnt from me, in the presence of many listeners, entrust to reliable people, who will be able in their turn to teach others. <span class="verse" rel="v055002003" id="002003" >3</span>
 Share hardships with me, as a true soldier of Christ Jesus. <span class="verse" rel="v055002004" id="002004" >4</span>
 A soldier on active service, to please his superior officer, always avoids entangling himself in the affairs of ordinary life. <span class="verse" rel="v055002005" id="002005" >5</span>
 No athlete is ever awarded the wreath of victory unless they have kept the rules. <span class="verse" rel="v055002006" id="002006" >6</span>
 The labourer who does the work should be the first to receive a share of the fruits of the earth. <span class="verse" rel="v055002007" id="002007" >7</span>
 Reflect on what I say; the Lord will always help you to understand. <span class="verse" rel="v055002008" id="002008" >8</span>
 Keep before your mind Jesus Christ, raised from the dead, a descendant of David, as told in the good news entrusted to me; <span class="verse" rel="v055002009" id="002009" >9</span>
 in the service of which I am suffering hardships, even to being put in fetters as a criminal. But the message of God is not fettered; <span class="verse" rel="v055002010" id="002010" >10</span>
 and that is why I submit to anything for the sake of God’s people: so that they also may obtain the salvation which comes from union with Christ Jesus, and imperishable glory. <span class="verse" rel="v055002011" id="002011" >11</span>
 How true this saying is – “If we have shared his death, we will also share his life. <span class="verse" rel="v055002012" id="002012" >12</span>
 If we continue to endure, we will also share his throne. If we should ever disown him, he, too, will disown us. <span class="verse" rel="v055002013" id="002013" >13</span>
 If we lose our trust, he is still to be trusted, for he cannot be false to himself!” 
<!-- 002 013 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v055002014" id="002014" >14</span>
 Remind people of all this; tell them solemnly, as in the sight of God, to avoid controversy, a useless thing and the ruin of those who listen to it. <span class="verse" rel="v055002015" id="002015" >15</span>
 Do your utmost to show yourself true to God, a worker with no reason to be ashamed, accurate in delivering the message of the truth. <span class="verse" rel="v055002016" id="002016" >16</span>
 Avoid profane prattle. Those who indulge in it only get deeper into irreligious ways, <span class="verse" rel="v055002017" id="002017" >17</span>
 and their teaching will spread like a cancer. Hymenaeus and Philetus are instances of this. <span class="verse" rel="v055002018" id="002018" >18</span>
 They have gone completely astray as regards the truth; they say that a resurrection has already taken place, and so upset some people’s faith. <span class="verse" rel="v055002019" id="002019" >19</span>
 Yet God’s firm foundation still stands unmoved, and it bears this inscription – 
<p class="indent1"> “THE LORD KNOWS THOSE WHO ARE HIS”; 
<!-- 002 019 -->


<p> and this – 
<p class="indent1"> “LET ALL THOSE WHO USE THE NAME OF THE LORD TURN AWAY FROM WICKEDNESS.” 
<!-- 002 019 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v055002020" id="002020" >20</span>
 Now in a large house there are not only things of gold and silver, but also others of wood and earthenware, some for better and some for common use. <span class="verse" rel="v055002021" id="002021" >21</span>
 If, then, a person has escaped from the pollution of such errors as I have mentioned, they will be like a thing kept for better use, set apart, serviceable to its owner, ready for any good purpose. <span class="verse" rel="v055002022" id="002022" >22</span>
 Flee from the passions of youth, but pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace, in the company of those who, with a pure heart, invoke the Lord. <span class="verse" rel="v055002023" id="002023" >23</span>
 Shun foolish and ignorant discussions, for you know that they only breed quarrels; <span class="verse" rel="v055002024" id="002024" >24</span>
 and a servant of the Lord should never quarrel. They ought, on the contrary, to be courteous to everyone, skilful teachers, and forbearing. <span class="verse" rel="v055002025" id="002025" >25</span>
 They should instruct their opponents in a gentle spirit; for, possibly, God may give those opponents a repentance that will lead to a fuller knowledge of truth, <span class="verse" rel="v055002026" id="002026" >26</span>
 and they may yet come to a sober mind, and escape from the devil’s net, when captured by the Lord’s servant to do the will of God. <p>
<!-- 003 026 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="003001">3</span> Be sure of this, that in the last days difficult times will come. <span class="verse" rel="v055003002" id="003002" >2</span>
 People will be selfish, mercenary, boastful, haughty, and blasphemous; disobedient to their parents, ungrateful, impure, <span class="verse" rel="v055003003" id="003003" >3</span>
 incapable of affection, merciless, slanderous, wanting in self-control, brutal, careless of the right, <span class="verse" rel="v055003004" id="003004" >4</span>
 treacherous, reckless, and puffed up with pride; they will love pleasure more than they love God; <span class="verse" rel="v055003005" id="003005" >5</span>
 and while they retain the outward form of religion, they will not allow it to influence them. Turn your back on such people as these. <span class="verse" rel="v055003006" id="003006" >6</span>
 For among them are to be found those who creep into homes and captivate weak women – women who, loaded with sins, and slaves to all kinds of passions, <span class="verse" rel="v055003007" id="003007" >7</span>
 are always learning, and yet never able to attain to a real knowledge of the truth. <span class="verse" rel="v055003008" id="003008" >8</span>
 Just as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so do these people, in their turn, oppose the truth. Their minds are corrupted, and, as regards the faith, they are utterly worthless. <span class="verse" rel="v055003009" id="003009" >9</span>
 They will not, however, make further progress; for their wicked folly will be plain to everyone, just as the folly Jannes and Jambres was. <span class="verse" rel="v055003010" id="003010" >10</span>
 But you, Timothy, were a close observer of my teaching, my conduct, my purposes, my faith, my forbearance, my love, and my patient endurance, <span class="verse" rel="v055003011" id="003011" >11</span>
 as well as of my persecutions, and of the sufferings which I met with at Antioch, Iconium, and Lystra. You know what persecutions I underwent; and yet the Lord brought me safe out of all! <span class="verse" rel="v055003012" id="003012" >12</span>
 Yes, and all who aim at living a religious life in union with Christ Jesus will have to suffer persecution; <span class="verse" rel="v055003013" id="003013" >13</span>
 but wicked people and impostors will go from bad to worse, deceiving others and deceived themselves. <span class="verse" rel="v055003014" id="003014" >14</span>
 You, however, must stand by what you learnt and accepted as true. You know who they were from whom you learnt it; <span class="verse" rel="v055003015" id="003015" >15</span>
 and that, from your childhood, you have known the sacred writings, which can give you the wisdom that, through belief in Christ Jesus, leads to salvation. <span class="verse" rel="v055003016" id="003016" >16</span>
 All scripture is God-breathed: helpful for teaching, for refuting error, for giving guidance, and for training others in righteousness; <span class="verse" rel="v055003017" id="003017" >17</span>
 so that God’s people may be capable and equipped for good work of every kind. 
<!-- 004 017 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="004001">4</span> I solemnly charge you – in the sight of God and of Christ Jesus, who will one day judge the living and the dead – I charge you by his appearing and by his kingdom: <span class="verse" rel="v055004002" id="004002" >2</span>
 Proclaim the message, be ready in season and out of season, convince, rebuke, encourage, never failing to instruct with forbearance. <span class="verse" rel="v055004003" id="004003" >3</span>
 For a time will come when people will not tolerate sound teaching. They will follow their own wishes, and, in their itching for novelty, procure themselves a crowd of teachers. <span class="verse" rel="v055004004" id="004004" >4</span>
 They will turn a deaf ear to the truth, and give their attention to legends instead. <span class="verse" rel="v055004005" id="004005" >5</span>
 But you, Timothy, must always be temperate. Face hardships; do the work of a missionary; discharge all the duties of your office. 
<!-- 004 005 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v055004006" id="004006" >6</span>
 As for me, my life blood is already being poured out; the time of my departure is close at hand. <span class="verse" rel="v055004007" id="004007" >7</span>
 I have run the great race; I have finished the course; I have kept the faith. <span class="verse" rel="v055004008" id="004008" >8</span>
 And now the crown of righteousness awaits me, which the Lord, the just judge, will give me on that day – and not only to me, but to all who have loved his appearing. 
<h6>Conclusion</h6>
<!-- 004 008 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v055004009" id="004009" >9</span>
 Do your utmost to come to me soon, <span class="verse" rel="v055004010" id="004010" >10</span>
 for Demas, in his love for the world, has deserted me. He has gone to Thessalonica, Crescens to Galatia, and Titus to Dalmatia. <span class="verse" rel="v055004011" id="004011" >11</span>
 There is no one but Luke with me. Pick up Mark on your way, and bring him with you, for he is useful to me in my work. <span class="verse" rel="v055004012" id="004012" >12</span>
 I have sent Tychicus to Ephesus. <span class="verse" rel="v055004013" id="004013" >13</span>
 Bring with you, when you come, the cloak which I left at Troas with Carpus, and the books, especially the parchments. <span class="verse" rel="v055004014" id="004014" >14</span>
 Alexander, the coppersmith, showed much ill feeling towards me. The Lord will give him what his actions deserve. <span class="verse" rel="v055004015" id="004015" >15</span>
 You must also be on your guard against him, for he is strongly opposed to our teaching. <span class="verse" rel="v055004016" id="004016" >16</span>
 At my first trial no one stood by me. They all deserted me. May it never be counted against them! <span class="verse" rel="v055004017" id="004017" >17</span>
 But the Lord came to my help and strengthened me, in order that, through me, the proclamation should be made so widely that all the Gentiles should hear it; and I was rescued out of the lion’s mouth. <span class="verse" rel="v055004018" id="004018" >18</span>
 The Lord will rescue me from all evil, and bring me safe into his Heavenly kingdom. All glory to him for ever and ever! Amen. <p>
<!-- 004 018 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v055004019" id="004019" >19</span>
 Give my greeting to Prisca and Aquila, and to the household of Onesiphorus. <span class="verse" rel="v055004020" id="004020" >20</span>
 Erastus remained at Corinth, and I left Thophimus ill at Miletus. <span class="verse" rel="v055004021" id="004021" >21</span>
 Do your utmost to come before winter. Eubulus, Pudens, Linus and Claudia send you their greetings, and so do the rest of the Lord’s followers. <p>
<!-- 004 021 -->


<p><span class="verse" rel="v055004022" id="004022" >22</span>
 May the Lord be with your soul. God bless you all.

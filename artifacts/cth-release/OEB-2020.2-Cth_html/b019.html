<h1>Psalms</h1>
<h4>Book One</h4>
<h6>Psalm 1 – The Way of Happiness</h6>
<p class="indent1"><span class="chapter" id="001001">1</span><span class="dropcap">H</span>appy are those 
<p class="indent2"> who do not follow the counsel of the wicked, 
<p class="indent1"> not halting in ways frequented by sinners, 
<p class="indent2"> nor taking a seat in a gathering of scoffers. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019001002" id="001002" >2</span>
 But the law of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  is their joy, 
<p class="indent2"> they study it day and night. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019001003" id="001003" >3</span>
 They are like trees 
<p class="indent2"> planted by runlets of water, 
<p class="indent1"> yielding fruit in due season, 
<p class="indent2"> leaves never fading. 
<p class="indent2"> In all that they do, they prosper. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019001004" id="001004" >4</span>
 Not so fare the wicked, not so; 
<p class="indent2"> like chaff are they, blown by the wind. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019001005" id="001005" >5</span>
 So the wicked will not stand firm in the judgment, 
<p class="indent2"> nor sinners appear, when the righteous are gathered. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019001006" id="001006" >6</span>
 For the way of the righteous is dear to the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, 
<p class="indent2"> but the way of the wicked will end in ruin. 
<h6>Psalm 2 – The Lord’s Chosen King</h6>
<p class="indent1"><span class="chapter" id="002001">2</span> Why this turmoil of nations, 
<p class="indent2"> this futile plotting of peoples, 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019002002" id="002002" >2</span>
 with kings of the earth conspiring, 
<p class="indent2"> and rulers consulting together, 
<p class="indent2"> against the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  and against his anointed, 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019002003" id="002003" >3</span>
 to snap their bonds 
<p class="indent2"> and fling their cords away? <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019002004" id="002004" >4</span>
 He whose throne is in heaven laughs, 
<p class="indent2"> the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  mocks them. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019002005" id="002005" >5</span>
 Then he speaks to them in his wrath, 
<p class="indent2"> and in his hot anger confounds them. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019002006" id="002006" >6</span>
 ‘This my king is installed by me, 
<p class="indent2"> on Zion my holy mountain.’ <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019002007" id="002007" >7</span>
 I will tell of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span> ’s decree. 
<p class="indent1"> He said to me: ‘You are my son, 
<p class="indent2"> this day I became your father. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019002008" id="002008" >8</span>
 Only ask, and I make you the heir of the nations, 
<p class="indent2"> and lord of the world to its utmost bounds. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019002009" id="002009" >9</span>
 You will break them with sceptre of iron, 
<p class="indent2"> shatter them like pottery.’ <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019002010" id="002010" >10</span>
 So now, you kings, be wise: 
<p class="indent2"> be warned, you rulers of earth. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019002011" id="002011" >11</span>
 Serve the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  in awe, 
<p class="indent2"> kiss his feet with trembling, 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019002012" id="002012" >12</span>
 lest, angry, he hurl you to ruin; 
<p class="indent2"> for soon will his fury blaze. 
<p class="indent2"> Happy all who take refuge in him. 
<h6>Psalm 3 – A Morning Prayer for Protection</h6>
<p><span class="chapter" id="003001">3</span><em>A psalm of David, when he fled from his son Absalom.</em>
<p class="indent1"> How many,  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, are my foes! 
<p class="indent2"> Those who rise up against me are many. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019003002" id="003002" >2</span>
 Many are those who say of me, 
<p class="indent2"> ‘There is no help for him in his God.’   Selah <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019003003" id="003003" >3</span>
 But you,  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, are shield about me, 
<p class="indent2"> my glory, who lifts up my head. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019003004" id="003004" >4</span>
 When loudly I call to the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, 
<p class="indent2"> from his holy hill he gives answer.   Selah <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019003005" id="003005" >5</span>
 I laid down and slept: 
<p class="indent2"> now I wake, for the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  sustains me. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019003006" id="003006" >6</span>
 I fear not the myriads of people 
<p class="indent2"> who beset me on every side. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019003007" id="003007" >7</span>
 Arise,  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>: save me, my God, 
<p class="indent2"> who strikes all my foes on the cheek, 
<p class="indent2"> and shatters the teeth of the wicked. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019003008" id="003008" >8</span>
 Victory belongs to the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>: 
<p class="indent2"> let your blessing descend on your people.   Selah 
<h6>Psalm 4 – An Evening Prayer</h6>
<p><span class="chapter" id="004001">4</span><em>For the leader, with stringed instruments. A psalm of David.</em>
<p class="indent1"> Answer my cry, 
<p class="indent2"> God, my defender. 
<p class="indent1"> Often from straits you have brought me 
<p class="indent2"> to spacious places. 
<p class="indent1"> So now show me your favour 
<p class="indent2"> and hear my prayer. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019004002" id="004002" >2</span>
 How long, you proud people, 
<p class="indent2"> will my honour be stained 
<p class="indent1"> by the slanders you love, 
<p class="indent2"> and the lies that you follow?   Selah 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019004003" id="004003" >3</span>
 See! The  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  has shown me 
<p class="indent2"> his wonderful kindness: 
<p class="indent1"> the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  hears, 
<p class="indent2"> when I call to him. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019004004" id="004004" >4</span>
 Sin not in your anger: 
<p class="indent2"> but speak in your heart 
<p class="indent2"> on your bed, and be still.   Selah 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019004005" id="004005" >5</span>
 Offer true sacrifice, 
<p class="indent2"> trust in the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019004006" id="004006" >6</span>
 Many are longing 
<p class="indent2"> for fortune to smile. 
<p class="indent1"> Lift upon us 
<p class="indent2"> the light of your face. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019004007" id="004007" >7</span>
 You have put in my heart,  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, 
<p class="indent2"> a deeper joy 
<p class="indent1"> than was theirs who had corn 
<p class="indent2"> and wine in abundance. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019004008" id="004008" >8</span>
 So in peace I will 
<p class="indent2"> lie down and sleep; 
<p class="indent1"> for you,  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, keep me 
<p class="indent2"> safe. 
<h6>Psalm 5 – A Prayer for Guidance</h6>
<p><span class="chapter" id="005001">5</span><em>For the leader: A psalm of David, to be accompanied by the flute.</em>
<p class="indent1"> Hear my words,  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>: 
<p class="indent2"> give heed to my whisper. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019005002" id="005002" >2</span>
 Attend to my loud cry for help, 
<p class="indent2"> my king and my God. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019005003" id="005003" >3</span>
 When I pray to you,  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, in the morning, 
<p class="indent2"> hear my voice. 
<p class="indent1"> I make ready for you in the morning, 
<p class="indent2"> and look for a sign. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019005004" id="005004" >4</span>
 For you are no God who takes pleasure in wickedness: 
<p class="indent2"> no one of evil can be your guest. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019005005" id="005005" >5</span>
 No braggarts can stand in your presence, 
<p class="indent2"> you hate all workers of wrong. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019005006" id="005006" >6</span>
 You destroy all speakers of lies, 
<p class="indent2"> people of blood and deceit you abhor. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019005007" id="005007" >7</span>
 But I, through your kindness abundant, 
<p class="indent2"> may enter your house, 
<p class="indent1"> and towards the shrine of your temple 
<p class="indent2"> may reverently bow. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019005008" id="005008" >8</span>
 Lead me,  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, in your righteousness 
<p class="indent2"> because of my enemies. 
<p class="indent2"> Make your way level before me. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019005009" id="005009" >9</span>
 For their mouth is a stranger to truth, 
<p class="indent2"> their heart is a pit of destruction. 
<p class="indent1"> Their throat is a wide open grave, 
<p class="indent2"> their tongue the smooth tongue of the hypocrite. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019005010" id="005010" >10</span>
 Condemn them, God; 
<p class="indent2"> let their schemes bring them down to the ground. 
<p class="indent1"> For their numberless crimes thrust them down 
<p class="indent2"> for playing the rebel against you. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019005011" id="005011" >11</span>
 But let all who take refuge in you 
<p class="indent2"> ring out their gladness forever. 
<p class="indent1"> Protect those who love your name, 
<p class="indent2"> so they may exult in you. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019005012" id="005012" >12</span>
 For you give your blessing,  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, to the godly, 
<p class="indent2"> and the shield of your favour protects them. 
<h6>Psalm 6 – A Cry for Help in Time of Trouble</h6>
<p><span class="chapter" id="006001">6</span><em>For the leader; with instrumental music on the sheminith. A psalm of David.</em>
<p class="indent1"> Rebuke me not,  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, in your anger, 
<p class="indent2"> punish me not in your wrath. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019006002" id="006002" >2</span>
<span class="nd"> Lord</span>, be gracious to me 
<p class="indent2"> in my weakness. 
<p class="indent1"> Heal me  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, 
<p class="indent2"> for racked is my body; 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019006003" id="006003" >3</span>
 all of me utterly racked. 
<p class="indent2"> Why do you wait so long,  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>? <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019006004" id="006004" >4</span>
 Turn,  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, rescue me; 
<p class="indent2"> save me, because of your love. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019006005" id="006005" >5</span>
 For in death none can call you to mind; 
<p class="indent2"> in Sheol who can praise you? <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019006006" id="006006" >6</span>
 I am so weary of sighing. 
<p class="indent2"> All the night I make my bed swim, 
<p class="indent2"> and wet my couch with my tears. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019006007" id="006007" >7</span>
 My eyes swollen with grief; 
<p class="indent2"> from weeping caused by my foes. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019006008" id="006008" >8</span>
 Begone, workers of wrong, 
<p class="indent2"> for the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  has heard my loud weeping, 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019006009" id="006009" >9</span>
 the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  has heard my entreaty, 
<p class="indent2"> the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  accepts my prayer. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019006010" id="006010" >10</span>
 My foes will be stricken with terror, 
<p class="indent2"> brought to shame and dismay in a moment. 
<h6>Psalm 7 – A Prayer to the God of Justice</h6>
<p><span class="chapter" id="007001">7</span><em>A Shiggaion of David, which he sang to the </em><span class="nd"> Lord </span>  about Cush, the Benjamite. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="nd"> Lord </span>  my God, I take refuge in you. 
<p class="indent1"> Deliver me, save me from all who pursue me; 
<p class="indent2"><span class="verse" rel="v019007002" id="007002" >2</span>
 or like lions they will tear me to pieces, 
<p class="indent2"> and rend me, past hope of rescue. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019007003" id="007003" >3</span>
<span class="nd"> Lord</span>, my God, if my life has been such 
<p class="indent2"> if my hands have been stained with guilt, 
<p class="indent2"><span class="verse" rel="v019007004" id="007004" >4</span>
 if friends I paid back with evil, 
<p class="indent2"> if I plundered my foes without cause, 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019007005" id="007005" >5</span>
 may the enemy chase and find me, 
<p class="indent2">  trample my life to the ground, 
<p class="indent2"> my honour leave in the dirt!   Selah <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019007006" id="007006" >6</span>
 Arise,  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, in anger, 
<p class="indent2"> against my foes rise in fury. 
<p class="indent1"> Awake for my help: 
<p class="indent2"> let justice be done. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019007007" id="007007" >7</span>
 Gather the nations about you, 
<p class="indent2"> and sit on your lofty throne, 
<p class="indent2"><span class="verse" rel="v019007008" id="007008" >8</span>
 as the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, the judge of the peoples. 
<p class="indent1"> Judge me,  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, in my innocence 
<p class="indent2"> and according to my integrity. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019007009" id="007009" >9</span>
 Put an end to the wrong of the wicked,

<p class="indent1"> Searcher of hearts and minds, 
<p class="indent2"> righteous God. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019007010" id="007010" >10</span>
 God is my shield:

<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019007012" id="007012" >12</span>
 He will sharpen his sword without fail,

 his deadly weapons are ready, 
<p class="indent2"> his arrows he makes of flame. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019007014" id="007014" >14</span>
 The enemy who conceives evil;

<p class="indent2"> attend to my piercing cry. 
<p class="indent1"> Give heed to my prayer 
<p class="indent2"> out of lips unfeigned. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019017002" id="017002" >2</span>
 Let my vindication come from you, 
<p class="indent2"> your eyes see the truth. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019017003" id="017003" >3</span>
 When you test my heart when you visit at night, 
<p class="indent2"> and assay me like silver – you can find no evil. 
<p class="indent1"> I am determined that my mouth should not lie. 
<p class="indent2"><span class="verse" rel="v019017004" id="017004" >4</span>
 I gave earnest heed to the words of your lips. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019017005" id="017005" >5</span>
 My steps have held fast to the paths of your precepts 
<p class="indent2"> and in your tracks have my feet never stumbled. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019017006" id="017006" >6</span>
 So I call you, O God, with assurance of answer; 
<p class="indent2"> bend down your ear to me, hear what I say. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019017007" id="017007" >7</span>
 Show your marvellous love, you who save from enemies 
<p class="indent2"> those who take refuge at your right hand. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019017008" id="017008" >8</span>
 Keep me as the apple of the eye, 
<p class="indent2"> hide me in the shelter of your wings. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019017009" id="017009" >9</span>
 From wicked people who do me violence, 
<p class="indent2"> from deadly foes who crowd around me. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019017010" id="017010" >10</span>
 They have closed their hearts to pity, 
<p class="indent2"> the words of their mouths are haughty. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019017011" id="017011" >11</span>
 Now they dog us at every step, 
<p class="indent2"> keenly watching, to hurl us to the ground, 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019017012" id="017012" >12</span>
 like a lion, longing to tear, 
<p class="indent2"> like a young lion, lurking in secret. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019017013" id="017013" >13</span>
 Arise,  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, face them and fell them. 
<p class="indent2"> By your sword set me free from the wicked, 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019017014" id="017014" >14</span>
 by your hand, O  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, from those – 
<p class="indent2"> whose portion of life is but of this world. 
<p class="indent1"> But let your treasured ones have food in plenty 
<p class="indent1"> may their children be full and their children satisfied. <p>
<p class="indent2"><span class="verse" rel="v019017015" id="017015" >15</span>
 In my innocence I will see your face, 
<p class="indent1"> awake I am filled with a vision of you. 
<h6>Psalm 18 – A King’s Song of Gratitude</h6>
<p><span class="chapter" id="018001">18</span><em>For the leader. Of David, the servant of the </em><span class="nd"> Lord</span>, who recited the words of this song to the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  after the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  had saved him from the power of all his enemies and from the hand of Saul. He said: 
<p class="indent1"> I love you, O  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, my strength. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019018002" id="018002" >2</span>
 The  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  is my rock, my fortress, deliverer, 
<p class="indent2"> my God, my rock, where I take refuge, 
<p class="indent2"> my shield, my defender, my tower. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019018003" id="018003" >3</span>
 Worthy of praise is the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  whom I call on, 
<p class="indent2"> he rescues me from all my foes. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019018004" id="018004" >4</span>
 The waves of death broke about me, 
<p class="indent2"> fearful floods of chaos. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019018005" id="018005" >5</span>
 Sheol threw cords around me, 
<p class="indent2"> snares of death came to meet me. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019018006" id="018006" >6</span>
 In distress I cried to the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, 
<p class="indent2"> and shouted for help to my God; 
<p class="indent1"> in his temple he heard my voice, 
<p class="indent2"> into his ears came my cry. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019018007" id="018007" >7</span>
 Then the earth shook and quaked, 
<p class="indent2"> mountains trembled to their foundations, 
<p class="indent2"> and quaked because of his wrath. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019018008" id="018008" >8</span>
 Smoke went up from his nostrils, 
<p class="indent2"> devouring fire from his mouth, 
<p class="indent2"> coals were kindled by it. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019018009" id="018009" >9</span>
 Then he bent the sky and came down, 
<p class="indent2"> thick darkness was under his feet. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019018010" id="018010" >10</span>
 He rode on a cherub and flew, 
<p class="indent2"> darting on wings of wind, 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019018011" id="018011" >11</span>
 with his screen of darkness about him, 
<p class="indent2"> in thick dark clouds of water. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019018012" id="018012" >12</span>
 At the radiance before him there passed 
<p class="indent2"> hailstones and coals of fire. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019018013" id="018013" >13</span>
 The  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  thundered from heaven, 
<p class="indent2"> the Most High uttered his voice. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019018014" id="018014" >14</span>
 He shot his arrows and scattered them, 
<p class="indent2"> flashed lightnings, and routed them. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019018015" id="018015" >15</span>
 The channels of the sea were revealed, 
<p class="indent2"> the world was laid bare to its base, 
<p class="indent1"> at your rebuke, O  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, 
<p class="indent2"> at the blast of the breath of your nostrils. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019018016" id="018016" >16</span>
 He stretched from on high, he seized me, 
<p class="indent2"> drew me up from the mighty waters, 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019018017" id="018017" >17</span>
 and saved me from those who hated me – 
<p class="indent2"> fierce foes, too mighty for me. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019018018" id="018018" >18</span>
 In my day of distress they assailed me, 
<p class="indent2"> but the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  proved my support. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019018019" id="018019" >19</span>
 To a spacious place he brought me, 
<p class="indent2"> and, for love of me, he saved me. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019018020" id="018020" >20</span>
 The  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  repays my innocence, 
<p class="indent2"> he rewards my cleanness of hands. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019018021" id="018021" >21</span>
 For I kept the ways of the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, 
<p class="indent2"> nor have wickedly strayed from my God. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019018022" id="018022" >22</span>
 His commandments were all before me, 
<p class="indent2"> his statutes I put not away. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019018023" id="018023" >23</span>
 And I was blameless before him, 
<p class="indent2"> guarding myself from sin. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019018024" id="018024" >24</span>
 So the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  repaid my innocence, 
<p class="indent2"> my cleanness of hands in his sight. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019018025" id="018025" >25</span>
 With the loyal you are loyal, 
<p class="indent2"> and with the blameless blameless. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019018026" id="018026" >26</span>
 With the pure you show yourself pure, 
<p class="indent2"> but shrewd with the devious. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019018027" id="018027" >27</span>
 For the lowly people you save, 
<p class="indent2"> but haughty eyes you abase. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019018028" id="018028" >28</span>
 You are my lamp,  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, 
<p class="indent2"> my God who enlightens my darkness. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019018029" id="018029" >29</span>
 With you I can storm a rampart, 
<p class="indent2"> with my God I can leap a wall. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019018030" id="018030" >30</span>
 As for God, his way is perfect; 
<p class="indent2"> the word of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  is pure. 
<p class="indent2"> He is shield to all who take refuge in him. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019018031" id="018031" >31</span>
 For who is God but the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>? 
<p class="indent2"> And who is a rock but our God? 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019018032" id="018032" >32</span>
 The God who arms me with strength, 
<p class="indent2"> who cleared and smoothed my way. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019018033" id="018033" >33</span>
 He made my feet like hinds’ feet, 
<p class="indent2"> and set me up on the heights. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019018034" id="018034" >34</span>
 He taught my hands how to fight, 
<p class="indent2"> and my arms how to bend a bronze bow. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019018035" id="018035" >35</span>
 The shield of your help you gave me, 
<p class="indent2"> your right hand supports me, 
<p class="indent2"> you stoop down to make me great. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019018036" id="018036" >36</span>
 In your strength I took giant strides, 
<p class="indent2"> and my feet never slipped. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019018037" id="018037" >37</span>
 So I chased the foe till I caught them, 
<p class="indent2"> and turned not, till I made an end of them. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019018038" id="018038" >38</span>
 I smashed them, they could not rise, 
<p class="indent2"> they fell beneath my feet. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019018039" id="018039" >39</span>
 You did arm me with strength for war, 
<p class="indent2"> you did bow my assailants beneath me. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019018040" id="018040" >40</span>
 You made my foes turn their back to me, 
<p class="indent2"> and those who did hate me I finished. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019018041" id="018041" >41</span>
 They cried for help, but none saved them; 
<p class="indent2"> to the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, but he answered them not. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019018042" id="018042" >42</span>
 I beat them like dust of the market-place, 
<p class="indent2"> stamped them like mud of the streets. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019018043" id="018043" >43</span>
 From the strife of the peoples you saved me, 
<p class="indent2"> you made me head of the nations, 
<p class="indent2"> peoples I knew not did serve me. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019018044" id="018044" >44</span>
 On the instant they hear, they obey me, 
<p class="indent2"> foreigners come to me cringing. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019018045" id="018045" >45</span>
 Foreigners lose courage, 
<p class="indent2"> and come out of their strongholds trembling. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019018046" id="018046" >46</span>
 The  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  is alive! Blest be my rock! 
<p class="indent2"> Exalted be God, my protector! 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019018047" id="018047" >47</span>
 The God who gave me revenge, 
<p class="indent2"> and brought down nations beneath me, 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019018048" id="018048" >48</span>
 who saved me from angry foes, 
<p class="indent2"> and set me above my assailants, 
<p class="indent2"> safe from the violent. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019018049" id="018049" >49</span>
 For this I will praise you among the nations, 
<p class="indent2"> making music, O  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, to your name: 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019018050" id="018050" >50</span>
 for great triumphs he grants to his king, 
<p class="indent2"> and faithful love he shows his anointed, 
<p class="indent2"> to David and his seed evermore. 
<h6>Psalm 19 – The Glory of God in the Heavens</h6>
<p><span class="chapter" id="019001">19</span><em>For the leader. A psalm of David.</em>
<p class="indent1"> The heavens declare God’s glory, 
<p class="indent2"> the sky tells what his hands have done. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019019002" id="019002" >2</span>
 Day tells it to day, 
<p class="indent2"> night reveals it to night, 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019019003" id="019003" >3</span>
 without speaking, without words; 
<p class="indent2"> without the sound of voices. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019019004" id="019004" >4</span>
 But through all the world their voice carries 
<p class="indent2"> their words to the ends of the earth. <p>
<p class="indent1"> He has pitched a tent for the sun in the sky, 
<p class="indent2"><span class="verse" rel="v019019005" id="019005" >5</span>

 From one end of the heavens it rises,

<h6>In Praise of the Law</h6>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019019007" id="019007" >7</span>
 The law of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  is perfect, 
<p class="indent2"> renewing life. 
<p class="indent1"> The decrees of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  are trusty,

<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019019008" id="019008" >8</span>
 The behests of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  are right,

<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019019009" id="019009" >9</span>
 The fear of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  is clean, 
<p class="indent2"> it endures forever. 
<p class="indent1"> The  <span class="nd"> Lord </span> ’s judgments are true 
<p class="indent2"> and right altogether. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019019010" id="019010" >10</span>
 More precious are they than gold –

<p class="indent2"> that drops from the comb. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019019011" id="019011" >11</span>

<p class="indent2"> Absolve me from those I know not. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019019013" id="019013" >13</span>
 Keep your servant from wilful sins –

<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019019014" id="019014" >14</span>

<h6>Psalm 35 – A Prayer for Deliverance from Malicious Foes</h6>
<p><span class="chapter" id="035001">35</span><em>Of David.</em>
<p class="indent1"> Contend,  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, with those who contend with me, 
<p class="indent2"> do battle with those who do battle with me. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019035002" id="035002" >2</span>
 Grasp shield and buckler,

<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019035003" id="035003" >3</span>
 Draw spear and battle-axe,

<p class="indent2"> Assure me that you will help me. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019035004" id="035004" >4</span>
 Dishonour and shame be on those

<p class="indent2"> who are planning my hurt! 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019035005" id="035005" >5</span>
 As chaff before wind may they be,

 For they wantonly hid their net for me, 
<p class="indent2"> and dug a pit to destroy me. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019035008" id="035008" >8</span>
 Upon them may ruin come unawares; 
<p class="indent1"> may the net which they hid catch themselves,

<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019035009" id="035009" >9</span>
 Then I will exult in the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>,

<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019035011" id="035011" >11</span>

<p class="indent2"> and ask of me things that I know not. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019035012" id="035012" >12</span>
 Evil for good they requite me, 
<p class="indent2"> leaving me inwardly comfortless. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019035013" id="035013" >13</span>
 But when   they   were sick,   I   put on sackcloth, 
<p class="indent2"> and chastened myself with fasting. 
<p class="indent1"> I prayed with head bowed low, 
<p class="indent2"><span class="verse" rel="v019035014" id="035014" >14</span>
 as if for my friend or my brother. 
<p class="indent1"> I went about bowed and in mourning,

<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019035015" id="035015" >15</span>
 When I stumbled, they gleefully gathered,

<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019035016" id="035016" >16</span>
 impiously mocking and mocking, 
<p class="indent2"> bearing their teeth at me. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019035017" id="035017" >17</span>
 How long,  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, will you look on? 
<p class="indent2"> Rescue me from their roaring, 
<p class="indent2"> my precious life from the lions. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019035018" id="035018" >18</span>
 I will then give you thanks in the great congregation, 
<p class="indent2"> and praise you before many people. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019035019" id="035019" >19</span>
 Suffer not those to rejoice over me

<p class="indent1"> suffer not those who without cause abhor me 
<p class="indent2"> to wink with the eye. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019035020" id="035020" >20</span>
 For it is not peace that they speak 
<p class="indent2"> of those who are quiet in the land; 
<p class="indent1"> but treacherous charges they plot. 
<p class="indent2"><span class="verse" rel="v019035021" id="035021" >21</span>
 With wide open mouths they shout,

<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019035022" id="035022" >22</span>
 But you have seen, too, O  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, 
<p class="indent2"> keep not silence, O  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, 
<p class="indent2"> be not far from me. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019035023" id="035023" >23</span>
 Bestir you, awake, for my right

<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019035024" id="035024" >24</span>
 You are just,  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>: win for me justice, 
<p class="indent2"> let them not rejoice over me, 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019035025" id="035025" >25</span>
 inwardly saying, ‘Hurrah!

<p class="indent2"> Now we have swallowed him up.’ 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019035026" id="035026" >26</span>
 Shame and confusion together

<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019035027" id="035027" >27</span>
 Let such as delight in my cause

<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019037021" id="037021" >21</span>

 For that my guilt

<h6>Psalm 39 – The Pathos of Life</h6>
<p><span class="chapter" id="039001">39</span><em>For the leader; for Jeduthun. A psalm of David.</em>
<p class="indent1"> I vowed to watch my words,

<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019039003" id="039003" >3</span>
 My heart grew hot within me;

<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019039004" id="039004" >4</span>
 ‘Teach me, O  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, my end,

 See! My days you have made but a span,

<p><span class="chapter" id="040001">40</span><em>For the leader. A psalm of David.</em>
<p class="indent1"> For the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  I waited and waited,

<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019040002" id="040002" >2</span>
 From the horrible pit he drew me,

<p class="indent2"> and my steps he made firm. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019040003" id="040003" >3</span>
 He put a new song in my mouth,

<p class="indent1"> Many see it, and, filled with awe,

 In offerings bloody or bloodless

 Well, O  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, you know

<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019040011" id="040011" >11</span>
 So do not restrain,  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>,

 For evils that cannot be numbered

 O  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, be pleased to deliver me,

<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019040014" id="040014" >14</span>
 May those who are seeking my life

 But may all who seek after you

 I am weak and needy,

<h6>Psalm 70 – A Cry for Help in Persecution</h6>
<p><span class="chapter" id="070001">70</span><em>For the leader. Of David. For commemoration.</em>
<p class="indent1"> Quickly, God, deliver me,

<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019071006" id="071006" >6</span>

 All the day long shall my mouth

<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019071016" id="071016" >16</span>

 You have taught me, O God, from my youth, 
<p class="indent2"> and till now have I told of your wonders. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019071018" id="071018" >18</span>
 Even in old age and grey hair,

 Your power and your justice, O God,

 You have caused us to see troubles many,

 So with harp I will praise you,

<p class="indent2"> O you Holy One of Israel. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019071023" id="071023" >23</span>
 My lips shall ring out their joy,

<h6>Psalm 72 – A Prayer for a Just and Glorious Reign</h6>
<p><span class="chapter" id="072001">72</span><em>Of Solomon.</em>
<p class="indent1"> Give the king, O God, your own spirit of justice 
<p class="indent2"> your spirit of right to the son of the king, 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019072002" id="072002" >2</span>

<p class="indent2"> and your downtrodden ones with justice. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019072003" id="072003" >3</span>
 May the mountains bear weal for the people, 
<p class="indent2"> and the hills yield fruits of justice. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019072004" id="072004" >4</span>
 The weak may he help to their rights,

<p class="indent2"> and crush the oppressor in pieces. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019072005" id="072005" >5</span>
 May he live as long as the sun, 
<p class="indent2"> while the moon shines – for ages and ages. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019072006" id="072006" >6</span>

<p class="indent2"> the helpless and the downtrodden. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019072013" id="072013" >13</span>
 He pities the weak and the poor,

<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019072014" id="072014" >14</span>
 He redeems them from wrong and from violence,

<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019072015" id="072015" >15</span>
 Long may he live;

<h4>Book Three</h4>
<h6>Psalm 73 – Fellowship with God Here and Hereafter</h6>
<p><span class="chapter" id="073001">73</span><em>A psalm of Asaph.</em>
<p class="indent1"> Yes, God is good to the upright, 
<p class="indent2"> the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  to the pure in heart. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019073002" id="073002" >2</span>
 But my feet were almost gone, 
<p class="indent2"> my steps had nearly slipped, 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019073003" id="073003" >3</span>
 through envy of godless braggarts, 
<p class="indent2"> when I saw how well they fared. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019073004" id="073004" >4</span>
 For never a pang have they, 
<p class="indent2"> their body is sound and sleek. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019073005" id="073005" >5</span>
 They have no trouble like mortals, 
<p class="indent2"> no share in human pain. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019073006" id="073006" >6</span>
 So they wear their pride like a necklace, 
<p class="indent2"> they put on the garment of wrong, 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019073007" id="073007" >7</span>
 their eyes stand out with fatness, 
<p class="indent2"> their heart swells with riotous fancies. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019073008" id="073008" >8</span>
 Their speech is mocking and evil, 
<p class="indent2"> condescending and crooked their speech. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019073009" id="073009" >9</span>
 They have set their mouth in the heavens, 
<p class="indent2"> while their tongue struts about on the earth. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019073010" id="073010" >10</span>
 Small wonder that people resort to them, 
<p class="indent2"> and drink deep draughts of their lore. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019073011" id="073011" >11</span>
 ‘How does God know?’ they say, 
<p class="indent2"> ‘And has the Most High any knowledge?’ 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019073012" id="073012" >12</span>
 See! These are the godless, 
<p class="indent2"> with wealth and ease ever increasing. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019073013" id="073013" >13</span>
 Yes, in vain have I kept my heart pure, 
<p class="indent2"> and washed my hands in innocence; 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019073014" id="073014" >14</span>
 for all the day long was I plagued 
<p class="indent2"> not a morning but I was chastised. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019073015" id="073015" >15</span>
 But to resolve to speak like they do 
<p class="indent2"> would be treachery to your children. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019073016" id="073016" >16</span>
 So I sought to understand it, 
<p class="indent2"> but a wearisome task it seemed: 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019073017" id="073017" >17</span>
 till I entered the holy world of God 
<p class="indent2"> and saw clearly their destiny. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019073018" id="073018" >18</span>
 Yes, you set them on slippery places; 
<p class="indent2"> down to destruction you hurl them. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019073019" id="073019" >19</span>
 One moment and then what a horror of ruin! 
<p class="indent2"> They are finished and ended in terrors. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019073020" id="073020" >20</span>
 Like a dream, when one wakes, shall they be, 
<p class="indent2"> whose phantoms the waker despises. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019073021" id="073021" >21</span>
 So my bitterness of mind 
<p class="indent2"> and the pain that stabbed my heart 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019073022" id="073022" >22</span>
 show how dull I was and stupid 
<p class="indent2"> just like a beast before you. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019073023" id="073023" >23</span>
 But I am always with you, 
<p class="indent2"> you have hold of my right hand. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019073024" id="073024" >24</span>
 By a plan of yours you guide me 
<p class="indent2"> and will afterward take me to glory. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019073025" id="073025" >25</span>
 Whom have I in the heavens but you? 
<p class="indent2"> And on earth there is none I desire beside you. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019073026" id="073026" >26</span>
 Though flesh and heart waste away, 
<p class="indent2"> yet God is the rock of my heart, 
<p class="indent2"> yet God is my portion forever. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019073027" id="073027" >27</span>
 For see! Those who are far from you must perish, 
<p class="indent2"> you destroy all who are false to you. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019073028" id="073028" >28</span>
 But I am happy when close to God; 
<p class="indent2"> the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  my God I have made my refuge, 
<p class="indent2"> that I may recount all the things you have done. 
<h6>Psalm 74 – Lament on the Devastation of the Temple</h6>
<p><span class="chapter" id="074001">74</span><em>A maskil of Asaph.</em>
<p class="indent1"> Why, O God, have you spurned us forever? 
<p class="indent2"> Why smokes your wrath against the sheep of your pasture? 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019074002" id="074002" >2</span>
 Remember the community you purchased of old 
<p class="indent2"> to become by redemption the tribe of your heritage, 
<p class="indent2"> Zion, the mountain you made your home. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019074003" id="074003" >3</span>
 Rouse yourself, visit its ruins complete. 
<p class="indent2"> In the temple the foe has made havoc of all things. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019074004" id="074004" >4</span>
 Like lions your enemies roared through your house, 
<p class="indent2"> replacing our symbols by signs of their own,

 hacking, like woodsmen who lift 
<p class="indent2"> axes on thickets of trees, 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019074006" id="074006" >6</span>
 smashing with hatchets and hammers 
<p class="indent2"> all of its carved work together. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019074007" id="074007" >7</span>
 They have set your temple on fire,

<p class="indent2"> the place where lives your name. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019074008" id="074008" >8</span>
 They have said in their heart, ‘Let us utterly crush them.’ 
<p class="indent2"> They have burned all the houses of God in the land. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019074009" id="074009" >9</span>
 No symbol of ours do we see any more: 
<p class="indent2"> no prophet is there any more, 
<p class="indent2"> none is with us who knows how long. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019074010" id="074010" >10</span>
 How long, O God, is the foe to insult? 
<p class="indent2"> Shall the enemy spurn your name forever? 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019074011" id="074011" >11</span>
 Why, O  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, do you hold back your hand,

<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019074012" id="074012" >12</span>
 Yet God is our king from the ancient days, 
<p class="indent2"> in the midst of the earth working deeds of salvation. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019074013" id="074013" >13</span>
 It was you who did cleave the sea by your might, 
<p class="indent2"> and shatter the heads of the ocean monsters. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019074014" id="074014" >14</span>
 It was you who did crush many-headed Leviathan, 
<p class="indent2"> and give him as food to the beasts of the wilderness. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019074015" id="074015" >15</span>
 It was you who did cleave the fountains and torrents; 
<p class="indent2"> it was you who did dry the perennial streams. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019074016" id="074016" >16</span>
 Yours is the day; yours, too, is the night,

<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019074017" id="074017" >17</span>
 It was you who did fix all the borders of earth:

<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019074018" id="074018" >18</span>

<h6>Psalm 75 – God the Judge</h6>
<p><span class="chapter" id="075001">75</span><em>For the leader; al tashheth. A psalm of Asaph, a song.</em>
<p class="indent1"> We praise you, God, we praise you: 
<p class="indent2"> we would call on your name and declare your wonders. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019075002" id="075002" >2</span>
 ‘At the time I choose, 
<p class="indent2"> I will judge fairly. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019075003" id="075003" >3</span>
 Though earth melt and all her inhabitants, 
<p class="indent2"> it is I who keep steady her pillars.’   Selah 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019075004" id="075004" >4</span>
 I say to the boasters, ‘Boast not’; 
<p class="indent2"> to the wicked, ‘Lift not up your horn:

<p class="indent2"> speak not boldly against the Rock.’ <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019075006" id="075006" >6</span>
 For not from east nor west, 
<p class="indent2"> not from desert nor mountains; 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019075007" id="075007" >7</span>

<p class="indent2"> humbling one and exalting another. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019075008" id="075008" >8</span>
 In the hand of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  is a cup 
<p class="indent2"> foaming wine, richly spiced. 
<p class="indent1"> Out of this he pours a draught, 
<p class="indent2"> and all the wicked of earth

<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019075009" id="075009" >9</span>
 But I will rejoice forever, 
<p class="indent2"> singing praise to the God of Jacob. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019075010" id="075010" >10</span>
 I will hew all the horns of the wicked,

<h6>Psalm 76 – A Song of Victory</h6>
<p><span class="chapter" id="076001">76</span><em>For the leader. With instrumental music. A psalm of Asaph, a song.</em>
<p class="indent1"> God has made himself known in Judah,

<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019076003" id="076003" >3</span>
 There he broke the lightning arrows,

 Despoiled were the stout of heart;

<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019076008" id="076008" >8</span>

 Vow and pay to  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  your God,

<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019076012" id="076012" >12</span>
 He lops off the courage of princes,

<h6>Psalm 77 – A Prayer for Preservation as in the Days of Old</h6>
<p><span class="chapter" id="077001">77</span><em>For the leader. On Jeduthun. Of Asaph, a psalm.</em>
<p class="indent1"> Loudly will I lift my cry to God, 
<p class="indent2"> loudly to God, so he hears to me. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019077002" id="077002" >2</span>
 In the day of my trouble I seek the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>; 
<p class="indent2"> in the night I lift my hands in prayer, 
<p class="indent2"> refusing all comfort. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019077003" id="077003" >3</span>
 When I think of God, I moan; 
<p class="indent2"> when I muse, my spirit is faint.   Selah 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019077004" id="077004" >4</span>
 When you hold my eyes awake, 
<p class="indent2"> and I am restless and speechless, 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019077005" id="077005" >5</span>
 I think of the days of old, 
<p class="indent2"> call to mind distant years. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019077006" id="077006" >6</span>
 I commune with my heart in the night,

<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019077007" id="077007" >7</span>
 ‘Will the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  cast us off forever, 
<p class="indent2"> will he be gracious no more? 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019077008" id="077008" >8</span>
 Has his love vanished forever? 
<p class="indent2"> Is his faithfulness utterly gone? 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019077009" id="077009" >9</span>
 Has God forgotten to be gracious,

<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019077010" id="077010" >10</span>
 Then I said, ‘This it is that grieves me, 
<p class="indent2"> that the hand of the Most High has changed.’ 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019077011" id="077011" >11</span>
 I will think of the deeds of the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, 
<p class="indent2"> and remember your wonders of old. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019077012" id="077012" >12</span>

<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019077013" id="077013" >13</span>
 Then your way, O God, was majestic: 
<p class="indent2"> what God was great as our God? 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019077014" id="077014" >14</span>
 You were a God who did marvels, 
<p class="indent2"> you did show your power to the world 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019077015" id="077015" >15</span>
 by your arm you rescued your people, 
<p class="indent2"> the children of Jacob and Joseph.   Selah <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019077016" id="077016" >16</span>
 The waters saw you, O God. 
<p class="indent2"> The waters saw you and shivered; 
<p class="indent2"> to their depths they trembled. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019077017" id="077017" >17</span>
 Clouds poured torrents of water,

<p class="indent2"> your arrows sped to and fro. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019077018" id="077018" >18</span>
 Loud was the roll of your thunder, 
<p class="indent2"> lightnings lit up the world. 
<p class="indent2"> Earth quaked and trembled. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019077019" id="077019" >19</span>
 In your way,  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, through the sea, 
<p class="indent2"> in your path through the mighty waters, 
<p class="indent2"> your footsteps were all unseen. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019077020" id="077020" >20</span>
 You did guide your folk like a flock 
<p class="indent2"> by the hand of Moses and Aaron. 
<h6>Psalm 78 – The Warnings of History</h6>
<p><span class="chapter" id="078001">78</span><em>A maskil of Asaph.</em>
<p class="indent1"> My people, attend to my teaching: 
<p class="indent2"> bend your ears to the words of my mouth, 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019078002" id="078002" >2</span>
 as I open my mouth in a poem 
<p class="indent2"> on the riddling story of the past. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019078003" id="078003" >3</span>
 What we have heard and known, 
<p class="indent2"> and what our ancestors have told us, 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019078004" id="078004" >4</span>
 we will not hide from their children. 
<p class="indent2"> We will tell to the next generation 
<p class="indent1"> the praises and might of the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, 
<p class="indent2"> and the wonders that he has done. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019078005" id="078005" >5</span>
 He set up a testimony in Jacob, 
<p class="indent2"> a law he appointed in Israel, 
<p class="indent1"> which he commanded our ancestors 
<p class="indent2"> to make known to their children, 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019078006" id="078006" >6</span>
 that the next generation should know it, 
<p class="indent2"> that the children yet to be born 
<p class="indent1"> should arise and tell their children; 
<p class="indent2"><span class="verse" rel="v019078007" id="078007" >7</span>
 that in God they might put their confidence, 
<p class="indent1"> and not forget God’s works; 
<p class="indent2"> but that they might keep his commandments, 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019078008" id="078008" >8</span>
 and not be like their ancestors, 
<p class="indent2"> a generation defiant and stubborn, 
<p class="indent1"> a generation with heart unsteady, 
<p class="indent2"> and spirit unfaithful towards God. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019078009" id="078009" >9</span>
 Ephraimites, armed bowmen, 
<p class="indent2"> turned back in the day of battle. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019078010" id="078010" >10</span>
 They did not keep God’s covenant, 
<p class="indent2"> they refused to walk in his law. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019078011" id="078011" >11</span>
 They forgot what he had done, 
<p class="indent2"> and the wonders he had shown them. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019078012" id="078012" >12</span>
 He did wonders before their ancestors 
<p class="indent2"> in the country of Zoan in Egypt. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019078013" id="078013" >13</span>
 Through the sea which he split he brought them, 
<p class="indent2"> making waters stand up like a heap; 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019078014" id="078014" >14</span>
 he led them by day with a cloud, 
<p class="indent2"> all the night with a light of fire. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019078015" id="078015" >15</span>
 From the rocks which he split in the wilderness, 
<p class="indent2"> he gave them to drink as of ocean’s abundance. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019078016" id="078016" >16</span>
 He brought streams out of the rock, 
<p class="indent2"> and made water run down like rivers. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019078017" id="078017" >17</span>
 Yet they still went on sinning against him, 
<p class="indent2"> they defied the Most High in the desert. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019078018" id="078018" >18</span>
 They wilfully challenged God, 
<p class="indent2"> demanding the food that they longed for. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019078019" id="078019" >19</span>
 ‘Is God able,’ such was their challenge, 
<p class="indent2"> ‘to spread in the desert a table? 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019078020" id="078020" >20</span>
 From the rock that he struck there gushed water, 
<p class="indent2"> and torrents that overflowed; 
<p class="indent1"> but can he also give bread, 
<p class="indent2"> or provide his people with meat?’ <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019078021" id="078021" >21</span>
 When the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  heard this, he was furious, 
<p class="indent2"> and fire was kindled on Jacob, 
<p class="indent2"> anger flared up against Israel. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019078022" id="078022" >22</span>
 For they put no trust in God, 
<p class="indent2"> no confidence in his help. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019078023" id="078023" >23</span>
 So he summoned the clouds above; 
<p class="indent2"> and, opening the doors of heaven, 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019078024" id="078024" >24</span>
 he rained manna upon them for food, 
<p class="indent2"> and grain of heaven he gave them. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019078025" id="078025" >25</span>
 Everyone ate the bread of angels; 
<p class="indent2"> he sent them food to the full. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019078026" id="078026" >26</span>
 He launched the east wind in the heavens, 
<p class="indent2"> and guided the south by his power. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019078027" id="078027" >27</span>
 He rained meat upon them like dust, 
<p class="indent2"> winged bird like the sand of the sea. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019078028" id="078028" >28</span>
 In the midst of their camp he dropped it, 
<p class="indent2"> all around their tents. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019078029" id="078029" >29</span>
 They ate and were more than filled; 
<p class="indent2"> he had brought them the thing they desired. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019078030" id="078030" >30</span>
 But the thing they desired became loathsome: 
<p class="indent2"> while their food was still in their mouths, 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019078031" id="078031" >31</span>
 the wrath of God rose against them. 
<p class="indent2"> He slew the stoutest among them, 
<p class="indent2"> and laid low the young men of Israel. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019078032" id="078032" >32</span>
 Yet for all this they sinned yet more, 
<p class="indent2"> and refused to believe in his wonders. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019078033" id="078033" >33</span>
 So he ended their days in a breath, 
<p class="indent2"> and their years in sudden dismay. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019078034" id="078034" >34</span>
 When he slew them, then they sought after him, 
<p class="indent2"> they turned and sought God with diligence. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019078035" id="078035" >35</span>
 They remembered that God was their rock, 
<p class="indent2"> and the Most High God their redeemer. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019078036" id="078036" >36</span>
 But they flattered him with their mouth, 
<p class="indent2"> and lied to him with their tongue. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019078037" id="078037" >37</span>
 Their heart was not steady with him, 
<p class="indent2"> they were faithless to his covenant. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019078038" id="078038" >38</span>
 But he is full of pity: 
<p class="indent2"> he pardons sin and destroys not. 
<p class="indent1"> Often he turns his anger away, 
<p class="indent2"> without stirring his wrath at all. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019078039" id="078039" >39</span>
 So he remembered that they were but flesh, 
<p class="indent2"> breath that passes and does not return. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019078040" id="078040" >40</span>
 But how often they rebelled in the desert, 
<p class="indent2"> and caused him grief in the wilderness, 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019078041" id="078041" >41</span>
 tempting God again and again, 
<p class="indent2"> provoking the Holy One of Israel. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019078042" id="078042" >42</span>
 They did not remember his strength, 
<p class="indent2"> nor the day he redeemed from the foe, 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019078043" id="078043" >43</span>
 how he set his signs in Egypt, 
<p class="indent2"> in the country of Zoan his wonders. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019078044" id="078044" >44</span>
 He turned their canals into blood, 
<p class="indent2"> their streams undrinkable. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019078045" id="078045" >45</span>
 He sent forth flies, which devoured them; 
<p class="indent2"> frogs, too, which destroyed them. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019078046" id="078046" >46</span>
 Their crops he gave to the caterpillar, 
<p class="indent2"> and the fruits of their toil to the locust. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019078047" id="078047" >47</span>
 He slew their vines with hail, 
<p class="indent2"> and their sycamore trees with frost. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019078048" id="078048" >48</span>
 He delivered their cattle to the hail, 
<p class="indent2"> and their flocks to bolts of fire. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019078049" id="078049" >49</span>
 He let loose his hot anger among them, 
<p class="indent2"> fury and wrath and distress, 
<p class="indent2"> a band of destroying angels. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019078050" id="078050" >50</span>
 He cleared a path for his anger, 
<p class="indent2"> did not spare them from death, 
<p class="indent2"> but gave them over to pestilence. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019078051" id="078051" >51</span>
 He struck down all the firstborn in Egypt, 
<p class="indent2"> the first fruits of their strength in the tents of Ham. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019078052" id="078052" >52</span>
 He led forth his people like sheep, 
<p class="indent2"> he was guide to his flock in the desert. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019078053" id="078053" >53</span>
 Securely he led them, and free from fear, 
<p class="indent2"> while their foes were drowned in the sea. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019078054" id="078054" >54</span>
 To his holy realm he brought them, 
<p class="indent2"> to the mountain his right hand had purchased. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019078055" id="078055" >55</span>
 He drove out the nations before them, 
<p class="indent2"> and allotted their land for possession, 
<p class="indent2"> and their tents for Israel to live in. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019078056" id="078056" >56</span>
 Yet they tempted and angered the Most High God, 
<p class="indent2"> they did not observe his decrees. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019078057" id="078057" >57</span>
 They drew back, false like their ancestors; 
<p class="indent2"> they failed like a treacherous bow. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019078058" id="078058" >58</span>
 Their shrines stirred him to anger, 
<p class="indent2"> their idols moved him to jealousy. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019078059" id="078059" >59</span>
 When God heard of this, he was furious, 
<p class="indent2"> and he spurned Israel utterly. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019078060" id="078060" >60</span>
 He abandoned his home in Shiloh, 
<p class="indent2"> the tent he had pitched among people. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019078061" id="078061" >61</span>
 He gave his strength up to captivity, 
<p class="indent2"> his glory to the hands of the foe. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019078062" id="078062" >62</span>
 He gave his people to the sword,

<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019104011" id="104011" >11</span>
 The wild beasts all drink from them, 
<p class="indent2"> and the wild asses quench their thirst. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019104012" id="104012" >12</span>
 The birds have their home by the banks, 
<p class="indent2"> and sing in the branches. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019104013" id="104013" >13</span>
 From his chambers above he gives drink to the mountains, 
<p class="indent2"> and satisfies earth with the vials of heaven. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019104014" id="104014" >14</span>
 He makes grass grow for the cattle, 
<p class="indent2"> and herbs for people. 
<p class="indent1"> He brings bread out of the earth; 
<p class="indent2"><span class="verse" rel="v019104015" id="104015" >15</span>
 wine, to gladden hearts; 
<p class="indent1"> oil, to make faces shine; 
<p class="indent2"> bread, to strengthen hearts. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019104016" id="104016" >16</span>
 The trees of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  drink their fill 
<p class="indent2"> the cedars he planted on Lebanon, 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019104017" id="104017" >17</span>
 where the little birds build their nest, 
<p class="indent2"> and the stork whose home is the cypress. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019104018" id="104018" >18</span>
 The high hills are for the wild goats, 
<p class="indent2"> and the rocks are for coneys to hide in. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019104019" id="104019" >19</span>
 He created the moon to mark seasons, 
<p class="indent2"> and told the sun when to set. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019104020" id="104020" >20</span>
 You make it dark: night comes, 
<p class="indent2"> when all the wild beasts creep out. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019104021" id="104021" >21</span>
 Young lions that roar for their prey, 
<p class="indent2"> seeking their meat from God. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019104022" id="104022" >22</span>
 At sunrise they slink away, 
<p class="indent2"> and lie down in their dens. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019104023" id="104023" >23</span>
 Then people go forth to their work, 
<p class="indent2"> and toil till evening. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019104024" id="104024" >24</span>
 How many, O  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, are your works, 
<p class="indent2"> all of them made in wisdom! 
<p class="indent2"> The earth is filled with your creatures. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019104025" id="104025" >25</span>
 And there is the great broad sea, 
<p class="indent2"> where are countless things in motion, 
<p class="indent2"> living creatures, both great and small. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019104026" id="104026" >26</span>
 There go the ships, 
<p class="indent2"> and the Leviathan you made to play there. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019104027" id="104027" >27</span>
 They all look in hope to you, 
<p class="indent2"> to give them their food in due season. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019104028" id="104028" >28</span>
 And you give with open hand; 
<p class="indent2"> they gather and eat to their heart’s desire. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019104029" id="104029" >29</span>
 When you hide your face, they are terrified; 
<p class="indent2"> when you take their breath away, 
<p class="indent2"> they die and go back to their dust. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019104030" id="104030" >30</span>
 But a breath from your lips creates them, 
<p class="indent2"> and renews the face of the earth. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019104031" id="104031" >31</span>
 May the glory of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  be forever,

<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019104032" id="104032" >32</span>
 A glance of his makes the earth tremble, 
<p class="indent2"> a touch of his makes the hills smoke. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019104033" id="104033" >33</span>
 I will sing to the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  while I live, 
<p class="indent2"> I will play to my God while I am. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019104034" id="104034" >34</span>
 May my musing be sweet to him, 
<p class="indent2"> for I rejoice in the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019104035" id="104035" >35</span>
 But may sinners be swept from the earth, 
<p class="indent2"> and the wicked vanish forever. 
<p class="indent2"> O my soul, bless the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>. 
<p class="indent3"> Hallelujah. 
<h6>Psalm 105 – The Inspiration of the Past</h6>
<p class="indent1"><span class="chapter" id="105001">105</span> Give thanks to the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, call on his name: 
<p class="indent2"> make known his deeds among the nations. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019105002" id="105002" >2</span>

<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019105003" id="105003" >3</span>
 Make your boast in his holy name,

<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019105004" id="105004" >4</span>
 Seek after the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  and his strength, 
<p class="indent2"> seek his face evermore. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019105005" id="105005" >5</span>
 Remember the wonders he did, 
<p class="indent2"> his portents, the judgments he uttered, 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019105006" id="105006" >6</span>
 you who are offspring of Abraham, his servant, 
<p class="indent2"> the children of Jacob, his chosen ones. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019105007" id="105007" >7</span>
 He is the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  our God: 
<p class="indent2"> in all the earth are his judgments. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019105008" id="105008" >8</span>
 He remembers forever his covenant, 
<p class="indent2"> his promise for a thousand generations 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019105009" id="105009" >9</span>
 The covenant he made with Abraham, 
<p class="indent2"> the oath he swore to Isaac, 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019105010" id="105010" >10</span>
 and confirmed as a statute to Jacob, 
<p class="indent2"> a pact everlasting to Israel 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019105011" id="105011" >11</span>
 to give them the land of Canaan 
<p class="indent2"> as the lot which they should inherit. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019105012" id="105012" >12</span>
 And when they were very few, 
<p class="indent2"> few and but pilgrims therein, 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019105013" id="105013" >13</span>
 wandering from nation to nation, 
<p class="indent2"> journeying from people to people, 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019105014" id="105014" >14</span>
 he allowed no one to oppress them, 
<p class="indent2"> even punishing kings for their sakes. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019105015" id="105015" >15</span>
 He forbade them to touch his anointed, 
<p class="indent2"> or do any hurt to his prophets. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019105016" id="105016" >16</span>
 When he called down famine on the land, 
<p class="indent2"> and cut off the bread which sustained them, 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019105017" id="105017" >17</span>
 he sent before them a man, 
<p class="indent2"> Joseph, who was sold as a slave. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019105018" id="105018" >18</span>
 His feet were galled with fetters, 
<p class="indent2"> he was laid in chains of iron, 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019105019" id="105019" >19</span>
 till the time that his word came to pass, 
<p class="indent2"> the word of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  that had tried him. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019105020" id="105020" >20</span>
 The king sent and freed him, 
<p class="indent2"> the ruler of nations released him. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019105021" id="105021" >21</span>
 He made him lord of his household, 
<p class="indent2"> and ruler of all his possessions, 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019105022" id="105022" >22</span>
 to admonish his princes at will 
<p class="indent2"> and instruct his elders in wisdom. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019105023" id="105023" >23</span>
 Thus Israel came into Egypt, 
<p class="indent2"> Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019105024" id="105024" >24</span>
 His people he made very fruitful, 
<p class="indent2"> and mightier than their foes. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019105025" id="105025" >25</span>
 He inspired them to hate his people, 
<p class="indent2"> and to deal with his servants craftily. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019105026" id="105026" >26</span>
 He sent his servant Moses, 
<p class="indent2"> and Aaron whom he had chosen, 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019105027" id="105027" >27</span>
 portents he wrought in Egypt, 
<p class="indent2"> and signs in the land of Ham. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019105028" id="105028" >28</span>
 Darkness he sent, and it fell: 
<p class="indent2"> yet they gave no heed to his word. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019105029" id="105029" >29</span>
 He turned their waters into blood, 
<p class="indent2"> thus causing their fish to die. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019105030" id="105030" >30</span>
 Their land was alive with frogs, 
<p class="indent2"> swarming even in the royal chambers. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019105031" id="105031" >31</span>
 At his command came flies, 
<p class="indent2"> and lice in all their borders. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019105032" id="105032" >32</span>
 He gave them hail for rain 
<p class="indent2"> and fire that flashed through the land, 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019105033" id="105033" >33</span>
 smiting their vines and figs, 
<p class="indent2"> breaking the trees of their border. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019105034" id="105034" >34</span>
 At his command came locusts, 
<p class="indent2"> young locusts beyond all counting, 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019105035" id="105035" >35</span>
 which ate every herb in the land, 
<p class="indent2"> ate up, too, the fruit of their ground. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019105036" id="105036" >36</span>
 He struck down in their land all the firstborn, 
<p class="indent2"> the firstlings of all their strength 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019105037" id="105037" >37</span>
 Then forth he led Israel with silver and gold, 
<p class="indent2"> and among his tribes no one was weary. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019105038" id="105038" >38</span>
 Egypt was glad when they left, 
<p class="indent2"> for terror had fallen upon them. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019105039" id="105039" >39</span>
 He spread out a cloud to screen them, 
<p class="indent2"> and fire to give light in the night. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019105040" id="105040" >40</span>
 He sent quails at their entreaty, 
<p class="indent2"> and heavenly bread in abundance. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019105041" id="105041" >41</span>
 He opened the rock; waters gushed: 
<p class="indent2"> in the desert they ran like a river. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019105042" id="105042" >42</span>
 For he remembered his holy promise 
<p class="indent2"> to Abraham his servant. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019105043" id="105043" >43</span>
 So he led out his people with joy, 
<p class="indent2"> his elect with a ringing cry. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019105044" id="105044" >44</span>
 And he gave them the lands of the nations, 
<p class="indent2"> the fruit of their toil for possession, 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019105045" id="105045" >45</span>
 that so they might keep his statutes, 
<p class="indent2"> and be of his laws observant. 
<p class="indent3"> Hallelujah.

<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019106003" id="106003" >3</span>
 Happy they who act justly,

<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019106004" id="106004" >4</span>
 Remember me,  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, as you remember your people, 
<p class="indent2"> and visit me with your gracious help. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019106005" id="106005" >5</span>
 May I see the good fortune of your elect,

<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019106006" id="106006" >6</span>
 We, like our fathers, have sinned, 
<p class="indent2"> we have done perversely and wickedly 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019106007" id="106007" >7</span>
 In the land of Egypt our fathers, 
<p class="indent2"> all heedless of your wonders, 
<p class="indent1"> and unmindful of your great kindness, 
<p class="indent2"> at the Red Sea defied the Most High. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019106008" id="106008" >8</span>
 But true to his name he saved them, 
<p class="indent2"> in order to show his might. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019106009" id="106009" >9</span>
 He rebuked the Red Sea, and it dried; 
<p class="indent2"> they marched through the depths as through desert, 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019106010" id="106010" >10</span>
 saved from the hand of the hostile, 
<p class="indent2"> redeemed from the hand of the foe. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019106011" id="106011" >11</span>
 The waters covered their enemies: 
<p class="indent2"> not one of them was left. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019106012" id="106012" >12</span>
 So then they believed in his words, 
<p class="indent2"> and began to sing his praise. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019106013" id="106013" >13</span>
 But soon they forgot his deeds: 
<p class="indent2"> they did not wait for his counsel. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019106014" id="106014" >14</span>
 Their greed was ravenous in the desert; 
<p class="indent2"> they put God to the test in the wilderness. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019106015" id="106015" >15</span>
 He gave them the thing they had asked for, 
<p class="indent2"> but sent wasting disease among them. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019106016" id="106016" >16</span>
 The camp grew jealous of Moses 
<p class="indent2"> and of Aaron, holy one of the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019106017" id="106017" >17</span>
 The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, 
<p class="indent2"> and covered Abiram’s company. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019106018" id="106018" >18</span>
 Fire broke out on their company, 
<p class="indent2"> flame kindled upon the wicked. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019106019" id="106019" >19</span>
 They made a calf in Horeb, 
<p class="indent2"> and bowed to the molten image. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019106020" id="106020" >20</span>
 They exchanged their glorious God 
<p class="indent2"> for the image of ox that eats grass. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019106021" id="106021" >21</span>
 They forgot the God who had saved them 
<p class="indent2"> by mighty deeds in Egypt 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019106022" id="106022" >22</span>
 Wonders in the land of Ham, 
<p class="indent2"> terrors by the Red Sea. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019106023" id="106023" >23</span>
 So he vowed, and would have destroyed them, 
<p class="indent2"> but for Moses his elect, 
<p class="indent1"> who stepped into the breach before him, 
<p class="indent2"> to divert his deadly wrath. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019106024" id="106024" >24</span>
 They spurned the delightsome land, 
<p class="indent2"> they refused to believe in his word. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019106025" id="106025" >25</span>
 They grumbled in their tents,

<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019106026" id="106026" >26</span>
 So he swore with uplifted hand 
<p class="indent2"> to lay them low in the wilderness; 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019106027" id="106027" >27</span>
 to disperse their seed among heathen, 
<p class="indent2"> to scatter them over the world. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019106028" id="106028" >28</span>
 Then they joined them to Baal of Peor, 
<p class="indent2"> and ate what was offered the dead. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019106029" id="106029" >29</span>
 They provoked him to wrath by their deeds, 
<p class="indent2"> and plague broke out among them. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019106030" id="106030" >30</span>
 Then Phinehas stood between, 
<p class="indent2"> and so the plague was stayed; 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019106031" id="106031" >31</span>
 and it was counted to him for righteousness 
<p class="indent2"> unto all generations forever. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019106032" id="106032" >32</span>
 They angered him at the waters of Meribah, 
<p class="indent2"> through them it went ill with Moses. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019106033" id="106033" >33</span>
 They rebelled against his spirit, 
<p class="indent2"> and he uttered speech that was rash. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019106034" id="106034" >34</span>
 They did not destroy the nations, 
<p class="indent1"> as the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  had commanded them; 
<p class="indent2"><span class="verse" rel="v019106035" id="106035" >35</span>
 but they mingled with the heathen, 
<p class="indent1"> and learned to do as they did. 
<p class="indent2"><span class="verse" rel="v019106036" id="106036" >36</span>
 Their idol gods they worshipped, 
<p class="indent1"> and they were ensnared by them. 
<p class="indent2"><span class="verse" rel="v019106037" id="106037" >37</span>
 They sacrificed their sons

<p class="indent2"><span class="verse" rel="v019106038" id="106038" >38</span>
 They poured out innocent blood

<p class="indent1"> and the land was polluted with blood.

<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019107030" id="107030" >30</span>

<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019107033" id="107033" >33</span>
 He turns streams into a wilderness, 
<p class="indent2"> springs of water into thirsty land,

<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019107035" id="107035" >35</span>
 A desert he makes pools of water,

 By his blessing they multiply greatly,

<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019107039" id="107039" >39</span>
 Yet when they are bowed and diminished 
<p class="indent2"> by oppression, misfortune, or sorrow, 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019107040" id="107040" >40</span>
 he pours contempt upon princes,

<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019107041" id="107041" >41</span>
 He lifts the poor out of misery,

<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019107042" id="107042" >42</span>
 At this sight shall the upright be glad,

<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v019107043" id="107043" >43</span>
 Let those who are wise observe this,

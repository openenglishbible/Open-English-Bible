<h1>Habakkuk</h1>
<h6>Habakkuk’s message</h6>
<!-- 001 001 -->


<p class="smallcappara"><span class="chapter" id="001001">1</span><span class="dropcap">T</span>he message seen by the prophet Habakkuk. 
<h6>(Habakkuk)</h6>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v035001002" id="001002" >2</span>
 How long,  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, have I cried out 
<p class="indent2">  and without you hearing me! 
<p class="indent1">  I cry to you, ‘Violence!’ 
<p class="indent2">  but you do not help. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v035001003" id="001003" >3</span>
 Why do you make me look upon wickedness 
<p class="indent2">  and behold trouble? 
<p class="indent1">  Destruction and violence are before my eyes, 
<p class="indent2">  and fighting and quarrelling. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v035001004" id="001004" >4</span>
 Therefore the law is weak, 
<p class="indent2">  and justice is never rendered; 
<p class="indent1">  for the wicked surround the righteous, 
<p class="indent2">  so that justice is perverted. 
<h6>(The Lord)</h6>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v035001005" id="001005" >5</span>
 Look at the nations, look well, 
<p class="indent2">  be shocked and amazed. 
<p class="indent1">  For I am about to do a work in your days; 
<p class="indent2">  you will not believe it when it is told. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v035001006" id="001006" >6</span>
 For I am about to raise up the Chaldeans, 
<p class="indent2">  a nation grim and quick of action 
<p class="indent1">  who sweep over the whole breadth of the earth 
<p class="indent2">  to seize dwellings not their own. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v035001007" id="001007" >7</span>
 They bring fear and terror. 
<p class="indent2">  They write their own rules. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v035001008" id="001008" >8</span>
 Their horses are swifter than leopards, 
<p class="indent2">  quicker than wolves hunting at dusk. 
<p class="indent1">  From afar they come swooping down, 
<p class="indent2">  like an eagle attacking its prey. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v035001009" id="001009" >9</span>
 They all come to do violence, 
<p class="indent2">  a horde like a desert wind, 
<p class="indent2">  they gather up captives like sand. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v035001010" id="001010" >10</span>
 At kings they scoff, 
<p class="indent2">  and princes are sport to them. 
<p class="indent1">  They laugh at every fortress, 
<p class="indent2">  and heap up earth to take it. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v035001011" id="001011" >11</span>
 Then they sweep on like the wind, 
<p class="indent2">  Their strength is their god. 
<h6>(Habakkuk)</h6>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v035001012" id="001012" >12</span>
 Are you not eternal,  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, 
<p class="indent2">  my holy one, who does not die? 
<p class="indent1">   <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  you have appointed them to execute judgment, 
<p class="indent2">  my rock, you have established them to punish. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v035001013" id="001013" >13</span>
 Your eyes are too pure to look at evil, 
<p class="indent2">  you cannot condone iniquity. 
<p class="indent1">  So why do you regard the treacherous in silence, 
<p class="indent2">  while the wicked swallows the upright? <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v035001014" id="001014" >14</span>
 You have made people like the fish of the sea, 
<p class="indent2">  like reptiles that have no ruler. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v035001015" id="001015" >15</span>
 The wicked sweep them all into their nets, 
<p class="indent2">  and gather them into their drag-nets, 
<p class="indent2">  and rejoice and celebrate. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v035001016" id="001016" >16</span>
 Therefore they sacrifice to their net, 
<p class="indent2">  and burn offerings to their drag-net; 
<p class="indent1">  for by their nets are their portions generous, 
<p class="indent2">  and their food is rich. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v035001017" id="001017" >17</span>
 Will they empty their nets continually, 
<p class="indent2">  slaughter nations unpityingly? <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="chapter" id="002001">2</span> I will take my stand on my watch-tower, 
<p class="indent2">  and station myself on a turret. 
<p class="indent1">  I will watch to see what the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  will say to me, 
<p class="indent2">  what answer he will make to my complaint. 
<h6>(The Lord)</h6>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v035002002" id="002002" >2</span>
 Then the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  answered me and said: 
<p class="indent1">  Inscribe the vision plainly on tablets, 
<p class="indent2">  so that even someone running by could read it. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v035002003" id="002003" >3</span>
 Though the vision waits for the time set, 
<p class="indent2">  it hastens to fulfilment and will not fail; 
<p class="indent1">  Though it linger long, wait for it. 
<p class="indent2">  For it surely will come and will not be delayed. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v035002004" id="002004" >4</span>
 The strength of the proud fails, 
<p class="indent2">  but the upright lives by their faithfulness. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v035002005" id="002005" >5</span>
 Wealth is treacherous, 
<p class="indent2">  the arrogant never have enough. 
<p class="indent1">  They make their desire as wide as Sheol, 
<p class="indent2">  are like death, unsatisfied, 
<p class="indent1">  For they gather to themselves all the nations, 
<p class="indent2">  bring together to themselves all peoples. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v035002006" id="002006" >6</span>
 Shouldn’t everyone mock them? 
<p class="indent2">  sing a taunt-song against them, and say: <p>
<p class="indent1">  Woe to the person who amasses what is not theirs, 
<p class="indent2">  and loads them self down with goods taken in pledge! 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v035002007" id="002007" >7</span>
 Won’t your creditors suddenly rise, 
<p class="indent2">  and those who will overthrow you awake, 
<p class="indent2">  and you become their prey? 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v035002008" id="002008" >8</span>
 For as you have plundered many peoples, 
<p class="indent2">  the survivors will prey upon you. 
<p class="indent1">  You have shed blood and committed violence 
<p class="indent2">  to the earth, peoples and their cities. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v035002009" id="002009" >9</span>
 Woe to you who seeks unjust gain for your dynasty, 
<p class="indent1">  who sets your nest on high to be safe from the reach of misfortune! <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v035002010" id="002010" >10</span>
 You have planned only shame for your dynasty. 
<p class="indent1">  You have destroyed many peoples, 
<p class="indent2">  and brought guilt upon yourself; 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v035002011" id="002011" >11</span>
 the stone will cry out from the wall, 
<p class="indent2">  and the beam from the timber will answer it. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v035002012" id="002012" >12</span>
 Woe to the person who builds a city by bloodshed, 
<p class="indent2">  and founds a town by crime 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v035002013" id="002013" >13</span>
 while the peoples toil for what fires will consume, 
<p class="indent2">  and the nations weary themselves for nothing! 
<!-- 002 013 -->


<p>  This the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  of hosts has said, <span class="verse" rel="v035002014" id="002014" >14</span>
 and the earth will be as full of the knowledge of the glory of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  as the seas are full of water. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v035002015" id="002015" >15</span>
 Woe to him who in fury gives drink to his neighbor 
<p class="indent2">  to make him drunk, and see him naked. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v035002016" id="002016" >16</span>
 You are filled with shame, not glory; 
<p class="indent2">  drink yourself and be uncovered. 
<p class="indent1">  The cup from the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span> ’s hand 
<p class="indent2">  will pass in turn to you, 
<p class="indent2">  and shame will cover your glory! <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v035002017" id="002017" >17</span>
 For the violence done to Lebanon will overwhelm you, 
<p class="indent2">  the destruction of animals will terrify you, 
<p class="indent1">  because you shed people’s blood on the earth, 
<p class="indent2">  destroyed people and their cities. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v035002018" id="002018" >18</span>
 What use is an idol? 
<p class="indent1">  A human made it, 
<p class="indent2">  a metal image. 
<p class="indent1">  It cannot speak, 
<p class="indent2">  it cannot teach truth, 
<p class="indent1">  Why does its maker trust it? <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v035002019" id="002019" >19</span>
 Woe to the person who says to a block, awake! 
<p class="indent2">  to a dumb stone, arise! 
<p class="indent1">  What can it teach? 
<p class="indent1">  It may be set with gold and silver, 
<p class="indent2">  but there is no breath at all within it. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v035002020" id="002020" >20</span>
 The  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  is in his holy temple. 
<p class="indent2">  Let all the earth be silent before him! 
<h6>Habakkuk’s psalm</h6>
<!-- 003 020 -->


<p><span class="chapter" id="003001">3</span> A prayer of Habakkuk the prophet, according to the Shigionoth. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v035003002" id="003002" >2</span>
 I have heard,  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, of your fame, 
<p class="indent2">  I have seen,  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, your work; 
<p class="indent1">  through the years you have make yourself known, 
<p class="indent2">  in wrath you remember mercy. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v035003003" id="003003" >3</span>
 God comes from Teman, 
<p class="indent2">  and the Holy One from the mountain-land of Paran.   Selah 
<p class="indent1">  His glory covers the heavens, 
<p class="indent2">  and his splendour fills the earth. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v035003004" id="003004" >4</span>
 Before him it is like the light, 
<p class="indent2">  rays he has at his side, 
<p class="indent2">  where his power is hidden. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v035003005" id="003005" >5</span>
 Before him pestilence stalks, 
<p class="indent2">  after him plague follows. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v035003006" id="003006" >6</span>
 He stands, and the earth trembles, 
<p class="indent2">  he looks, and the nations melt away, 
<p class="indent1">  and the mountains of old are scattered, 
<p class="indent2">  the everlasting hills bow down. 
<p class="indent1">  These are his ways from of old. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v035003007" id="003007" >7</span>
 The tents of Cushan are afraid, 
<p class="indent2">  the curtains of Midian tremble. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v035003008" id="003008" >8</span>
 Is your wrath,  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, with the rivers? 
<p class="indent2">  Is your anger against the streams? 
<p class="indent2">  Or your rage against the sea? 
<p class="indent1">  Is that why you ride on your war-steeds? 
<p class="indent2">  Why you mount your chariots of victory? 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v035003009" id="003009" >9</span>
 Why you bare your bow? 
<p class="indent2">  Why you fill your quiver with shafts? <p>
<p class="indent1">  You split the earth with torrents. 
<p class="indent2"><span class="verse" rel="v035003010" id="003010" >10</span>
 The mountains see you and writhe. 
<p class="indent1">  The tempest of waters sweeps by. 
<p class="indent2">  The great deep sends forth its voice, 
<p class="indent2">  and lifts up its hands. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v035003011" id="003011" >11</span>
 The sun forgets to rise. 
<p class="indent2">  The moon stands still in its place. <p>
<p class="indent1">  Your arrows go forth to give light. 
<p class="indent2">  Your glittering spear is as lightning. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v035003012" id="003012" >12</span>
 In rage you stride over the earth. 
<p class="indent2">  In wrath you trample the nations. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v035003013" id="003013" >13</span>
 You go forth to save your people. 
<p class="indent2">  You go to help your anointed. 
<p class="indent1">  You crush the head of the wicked nation, 
<p class="indent2">  laying him bare from thigh to neck.   Selah 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v035003014" id="003014" >14</span>
 You pierced his head with his spears, 
<p class="indent2">  as his champions storm out to scatter us, 
<p class="indent2">  as they rejoice to devour the poor secretly. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v035003015" id="003015" >15</span>
 You tread the sea with your horses, 
<p class="indent2">  while the mighty waters roar. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v035003016" id="003016" >16</span>
 I hear, and my body trembles, 
<p class="indent2">  and at the sound my lips quiver. 
<p class="indent1">  My bones begin to decay, 
<p class="indent2">  and my footsteps totter beneath me, 
<p class="indent1">  while I long for the day of distress 
<p class="indent2">  to come upon those who attack us. <p>
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v035003017" id="003017" >17</span>
 Though the fig tree bears no fruit, 
<p class="indent2">  and there are no grapes on the vines, 
<p class="indent1">  though the olive harvest fails, 
<p class="indent2">  and the fields produce no food, 
<p class="indent1">  though the flock is cut off from the fold, 
<p class="indent2">  and there is no herd in the stalls, 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v035003018" id="003018" >18</span>
 yet I will exult in the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, 
<p class="indent2">  and rejoice in the God who saves me. 
<p class="indent1"><span class="verse" rel="v035003019" id="003019" >19</span>
 The Lord  <span class="nd"> God </span>  is my strength; 
<p class="indent2">  he makes my feet as sure as the feet of deer, 
<p class="indent2">  and causes me to walk on the heights!

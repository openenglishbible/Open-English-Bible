                                PREFACE


*The Open English Bible*

     The Open English Bible project aims to create a modern English
translation of the Bible which is completely free of copyright
restrictions and available without cost for any purpose.
     The OEB is your Bible -- you can use it in worship, print as many
copies as you want (in whole or part), republish it on your own website,
even remix it or take it as the base for your own translation to meet
your needs and the needs of your community. And you can do this without
needing our permission or paying us a cent (or penny, rupee or kobo).

*Base texts*

     The normative text for the OEB New Testament is the Westcott & Hort
critical text. Since the NA28 is subject to a claim of copyright, W&H
remains the best available public domain text.
     The normative text for the OEB Old Testament is the Codex
Leningradensis (Leningrad Codex); specifically the electronic version of
the Westminster Leningrad Codex.
     The OEB is being created by taking existing English language
translations which are in the public domain, and conforming them to
modern English and suitable public domain Greek and Hebrew source texts.
     The New Testament of the OEB is being formed on the base of the
'Twentieth Century New Testament' ('TCNT'), in particular the revised
edition published in 1904.
     The TCNT was one of the earliest 20th century attempts at a
translation in clear modern language aimed at the ordinary reader and
based on a modern textual base (ie Westcott & Hort). Predating the mid
20th century translations such as the New English Bible and even
Moffatt"s groundbreaking attempt, it is out of copyright worldwide. The
TCNT also has a particular resonance with the open source and free
content communities of today -- it was created by a loose collaboration
of volunteers rather than a top down hierarchy. Given the requirements
of modern language and public domain status the TCNT was the best
contender.
     The Old Testament books which have been completed at this stage
lean heavily on the work of James Moffatt, John Edgar McFadyen and
Charles Foster Kent, who were very respected turn of the century Old
Testament scholars.

*Copyright*

     The OEB is available under a CC0 licence, effectively a waiver of
copyright which allows the maximum reuse. We request (though this is not
a licence condition) that altered versions be distributed under another
name, or with changes clearly and comprehensively disclosed so that
readers are not confused.

                              THE BOOK OF
                                  RUTH


*Naomi and Ruth*

     In the time when the judges ruled, there was once a famine in the
land. A man from Bethlehem in Judah took his wife and two sons to live
in the territory of Moab. His name was Elimelech and his wife's was
Naomi, and his two sons were Mahlon and Chilion. They were Ephrathites
from Bethlehem in Judah. After they had been living in Moab for some
time, Elimelech died, and Naomi was left with her two sons, who married
Moabite women named Orpah and Ruth. After they had lived there about ten
years, Mahlon and Chilion both died, and Naomi was left alone, without
husband or sons.
     So she set out with her daughters-in-law to return from the land of
Moab, for she had heard that the LORD had remembered his people and
given them food. As they were setting out together on the journey to
Judah, Naomi said to her daughters-in-law, 'Go, return both of you to
the home of your mother. May the LORD be kind to you as you have been
kind to the dead and to me. The LORD grant that each of you may find
peace and happiness in the house of a new husband.'
     Then she kissed them; but they began to weep aloud and said to her,
'No, we will return with you to your people.' But Naomi said, 'Go back,
my daughters. Why should you go with me? Can I still bear sons who might
become your husbands? Go back, my daughters, go your own way, because I
am too old to have a husband. Even if I should say, "I have hope," even
if I should have a husband tonight and should bear sons, would you wait
for them until they were grown up? Would you remain single for them? No,
my daughters! My heart grieves for you, for the LORD has sent me
adversity.' Then they again wept aloud, and Orpah kissed her mother-in-
law goodbye, but Ruth stayed with her.
     'Look,' said Naomi, 'your sister-in-law is going back to her own
people and to her own gods. Go along with her!' But Ruth answered, 'Do
not urge me to leave you or to go back. I will go where you go, and I
will stay wherever you stay. Your people will be my people, and your God
my God; I will die where you die, and be buried there. May the LORD
bring a curse upon me, if anything but death separate you and me.' When
Naomi saw that Ruth was determined to go with her, she ceased urging her
to return.
     So they journeyed on until they came to Bethlehem. Their arrival
stirred the whole town, and the women said, 'Can this be Naomi?'
     'Do not call me Naomi,' she said to them, 'call me Mara{  (1:20)
In Hebrew 'Naomi' means 'pleasant,' and 'Mara' means 'bitter.' }, for
the Almighty has given me a bitter lot. I had plenty when I left, but
the LORD has brought me back empty handed. Why should you call me Naomi,
now that the LORD has afflicted me, and the Almighty has brought
misfortune on me?' So Naomi and Ruth, her Moabite daughter-in-law,
returned from Moab. They reached Bethlehem at the beginning of the
barley harvest.

*In the Fields of Boaz*

     Now Naomi was related through her husband to a very wealthy man of
the family of Elimelech named Boaz. Ruth the Moabite said to Naomi, 'Let
me now go into the fields and gather leftover grain behind anyone who
will allow me.'
    'Go, my daughter,' she replied.
     So she went to glean in the field after the reapers. As it
happened, she was in that part of the field which belonged to Boaz, who
was of the family of Elimelech. When Boaz came from Bethlehem and said
to the reapers, 'The LORD be with you,' they answered him, 'May the LORD
bless you.'
     'Whose girl is this?' Boaz asked his servant who had charge of the
reapers. The servant who had charge of the reapers replied, 'It is the
Moabite girl who came back with Naomi from the territory of Moab. She
asked to be allowed to glean and gather sheaves after the reapers. So
she came and has continued to work until now and she has not rested a
moment in the field.'
     Then Boaz said to Ruth, 'Listen, my daughter. Do not go to glean in
another field nor leave this place, but stay here with my girls. Watch
where the men are reaping and follow the gleaners. I have told the young
men not to trouble you. When you are thirsty, go to the jars and drink
of that which the young men have drawn.'
     Then she bowed low and said to him, 'Why are you so kind to me, to
take interest in me when I am just a foreigner?' Boaz replied, 'I have
heard what you have done for your mother-in-law since the death of your
husband, and how you left your father and mother and your native land to
come to a people that you did not know before. May the LORD repay you
for what you have done, and may you be fully rewarded by the God of
Israel, under whose wings you have come to take refuge.' Then she said,
'I trust I may please you, my lord, for you have comforted me and spoken
kindly to your servant, although I am not really equal to one of your
own servants.'
     At mealtime Boaz said to Ruth, 'Come here and eat some of the food
and dip your piece of bread in the vinegar.' So she sat beside the
reapers, and he passed her some roasted grain. She ate until she was
satisfied and had some left. When she rose to glean, Boaz gave this
order to his young men: 'Let her glean even among the sheaves and do not
disturb her. Also pull out some for her from the bundles and leave for
her to glean, and do not find fault with her.'
     So she gleaned in the field until evening, then beat out what she
had gleaned. It was about a bushel of barley. Then she took it up and
went into the town and showed her mother-in-law what she had gleaned.
She also brought out and gave her that which she had left from her meal
after she had had enough.
     'Where did you glean today, and where did you work?' asked her
mother-in-law. 'A blessing on him who took notice of you!'
     So she told her mother-in-law where she had worked. 'The name of
the man with whom I worked today,' she said, 'is Boaz.'
     Naomi said to her daughter-in-law, 'May the blessing of the LORD
rest on this man who has not ceased to show his loving-kindness to the
living and to the dead. The man,' she added, 'is a near relation of
ours.'
     'He told me,' Ruth said, 'that I must keep near his young men until
they have completed all his harvest.'
     Naomi said to Ruth, 'It is best, my daughter, that you should go
out with his girls because you might not be as safe in another field.'
So she gleaned with the girls of Boaz until the end of the barley and
wheat harvest; but she lived with her mother-in-law.

*Night and morning*

     One day, Naomi said to Ruth, 'My daughter, should I not seek to
secure a home for you where you will be happy and prosperous? Is not
Boaz, with whose girls you have been, a relative of ours? Tonight he is
going to winnow barley on the threshing-floor. So bathe and anoint
yourself and put on your best clothes and go down to the threshing-
floor. But do not make yourself known to the man until he has finished
eating and drinking. Then when he lies down, mark the place where he
lies. Go in, uncover his feet, lie down, and then he will tell you what
to do.'
     'I will do as you say.' Ruth said to her.
     So she went down to the threshing-floor and did just as her mother-
in-law told her. When Boaz had finished eating and drinking and was in a
happy mood, he went to lie down at the end of the heap of grain. Then
Ruth came quietly and uncovered his feet and lay down. At midnight the
man was startled and turned over, and there was a woman lying at his
feet! 'Who are you?' he said. 'I am Ruth your servant,' she answered,
'Spread your cloak over your servant, for you are a near relative.' He
said, 'May you be blest by the LORD, my daughter. You have shown me
greater favour now than at first, for you have not followed young men,
whether poor or rich. My daughter, have no fear. I will do for you all
that you ask, for the whole town knows that you are a virtuous woman.
Now it is true that I am a near relative, but there is another man
nearer than I. Stay here tonight, and then in the morning, if he will
perform for you the duty of a kinsman, well, let him do it. But if he
will not perform for you the duty of a kinsman, then as surely as the
LORD lives, I will do it for you. Lie down until morning.'
     So she lay at his feet until morning, but rose before anyone could
recognise her, for Boaz said, 'No one must know that a woman came to the
threshing-floor.' He also said, 'Bring the cloak which you have on and
hold it.' So she held it while he poured into it six measures of barley
and laid it on her shoulders. Then he went into the city.
     When Ruth came to her mother-in-law, Naomi asked, 'Is it you, my
daughter?' Then Ruth told Naomi all that the man had done for her. 'He
gave me these six measures of barley,' she said, 'for he said I should
not go to my mother-in-law empty-handed.'
     'Wait quietly, my daughter.' Naomi said, 'Until you know how the
affair will turn out, for the man will not rest unless he settles it all
today.'
     Then Boaz went up to the gate and sat down. Just then the near
kinsman of whom Boaz had spoken came along. Boaz said, 'Hello, So-and-so
(calling him by name), come here and sit down.' So he stopped and sat
down. Boaz also took ten of the town elders and said, 'Sit down here.'
So they sat down.
     Then he said to the near relative, 'Naomi, who has come back from
the country of Moab, is offering for sale the piece of land which
belonged to our relative Elimelech, and I thought that I would lay the
matter before you, suggesting that you buy it in the presence of these
men who sit here and of the elders of my people. If you will buy it and
so keep it in the possession of the family, do so; but if not; then tell
me, so that I may know; for no one but you has the right to buy it, and
I am next to you.'
     'I will buy it,' he said.
     Then Boaz said, 'On the day you buy the field from Naomi, you must
also marry Ruth the Moabite, the widow of the dead, in order to preserve
the name of the dead in connection with his inheritance.'
     'I cannot buy it for myself without spoiling my own inheritance,'
the near relative said. 'You take my right of buying it as a relative,
because I cannot do so.'
     Now this used to be the custom in Israel: to make valid anything
relating to a matter of redemption or exchange, a man drew off his
sandal and gave it to the other man; and this was the way contracts were
attested in Israel. So when the near relative said to Boaz, 'Buy it for
yourself,' Boaz drew off the man's sandal.
     Then Boaz said to the elders and to all the people, 'You are
witnesses at this time that I have bought all that was Elimelech's and
all that was Chilion's and Mahlon's from Naomi. Moreover I have secured
Ruth the Moabite, the wife of Mahlon, to be my wife, in order to
perpetuate the name of the dead in connection with his inheritance, so
that his name will not disappear from among his relatives and from the
household where he lived. You are witnesses this day.'
     Then all the people who were at the gate and the elders said, 'We
are witnesses. May the LORD make the woman who is coming into your house
like Rachel and Leah, who together built the house of Israel. May you do
well in Ephrata, and become famous in Bethlehem. From the children whom
the LORD will give you by this young woman may your household become
like the household of Perez, whom Tamar bore to Judah.'
     So Boaz married Ruth, and she became his wife; and the LORD gave to
her a son. Then the women said to Naomi, 'Blessed be the LORD who has
not left you at this time without a near relative, and may his name be
famous in Israel. This child will restore your vigor and nourish you in
your old age; for your daughter-in-law who loves you, who is worth more
to you than seven sons, has borne a son to Boaz!'
     So Naomi took the child in her arms and cared for him as if he was
her own. The women of the neighbourhood gave him a name, saying, 'A son
is born to Naomi!' They named him Obed. He became the father of Jesse,
who was the father of David.

*Genealogy*

     This is the genealogy of Perez:

     Perez was the father of Hezron,
     Hezron of Ram,
     Ram of Amminadab,
     Amminidab of Nashon,
     Nashon of Salmon,
     Salmon of Boaz,
     Boaz of Obed,
     Obed of Jesse,
     Jesse of David.

                              THE BOOK OF
                                 ESTHER


*The Follies of a Despot*

     These events happened in the time of Ahasuerus, who ruled over a
hundred and twenty-seven provinces from India to Ethiopia from his royal
throne in the fortified palace of Susa.
     In the third year of his reign, the king gave a feast for all his
officers and courtiers. The commanders of the military forces of Persia
and Media, the nobles and provincial rulers were present while for one
hundred and eighty days he showed them the glorious riches of his
kingdom and the costliness of his magnificent regalia.
     When these days were ended, the king held a banquet for all the
people who were present in the royal palace at Susa, high and low alike.
It was a seven days' feast in the enclosed garden of the royal palace.
There were white and violet cotton curtains fastened to silver rings and
pillars of marble with cords of fine purple wool and linen. The couches
were of gold and silver placed upon a mosaic pavement of alabaster,
white marble, mother-of-pearl, and dark stone. Drink was brought in
vessels of gold -- which were all different -- and the king's wine was
provided with royal liberality. The drinking was unrestricted, for the
king had directed all the officers of his household to let each man do
as he pleased. Queen Vashti also gave a feast for the women in the King
Ahasuerus' royal palace.
     On the seventh day, when the king was merry with wine, he commanded
Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, Abagtha, Zathar and Carkas, his seven
eunuch attendants to bring Queen Vashti before him with the royal diadem
on her head, to show her beauty to the people and the officials, for she
was very beautiful. But Queen Vashti refused to come as the king
commanded through the eunuchs. Then the king became very angry and his
fury burned within him.
     The king turned to the wise men who knew the precedents, for it was
his custom to confer with those wise in law. Those next to him were
Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena and Memucan, seven
officials of Persia and Media who had access to the king and were
highest in the kingdom. 'Queen Vashti', the king said, 'has failed to
obey my royal command -- the command of King Ahasuerus conveyed through
the eunuchs! What does the law say should be done to her?'
     Memucan replied before the king and the officials, 'Queen Vashti
has done wrong not only to the king but also to all the officials and to
all the peoples in all of the king's provinces. The refusal of the queen
will be reported to all the women with the result that it will make them
despise their husbands. They will say, "King Ahasuerus commanded Queen
Vashti to be brought in before him, but she did not come!" This very day
the ladies of Persia and Media who have heard of the refusal of the
queen will tell it to all the king's officials, and there will be
contempt and strife! If it seems best to the king, let him send out a
royal edict. Let it be written among the laws of Persia and Media, never
to be repealed, that Vashti may never again come before King Ahasuerus.
Let the king give her place as queen to another who is more worthy than
she. When the king's decree which he makes is heard throughout his
kingdom -- great as it is -- the wives of all classes will give honour
to their husbands.'
     The proposal pleased the king and the officials, and the king did
as Memucan advised. He sent letters to all the provinces, to every
province in its own system of writing and to every people in their
language, that every man should be master in his own house!

*Choosing a Queen*

     Some time later, when the wrath of King Ahasuerus had subsided, he
remembered what Vashti had done and what had been decreed against her.
Then the king's servants who waited upon him said, 'Let beautiful young
virgins be sought for the king, and let the king appoint commissioners
to all the provinces of his kingdom to gather them all to Susa the royal
residence. Let them be brought into the women's quarters under the
custody of Hegai, the king's eunuch, who has charge of the women. Then
give them what is needed to make them beautiful, and let the girl who
pleases the king be queen instead of Vashti.' The proposal pleased the
king so he put it into action.
     In Susa the royal residence lived a Jew named Mordecai. He was son
of Jair, son of Shimei, son of Kish, a Benjamite. (Kish had been carried
away from Jerusalem with the exiles who were deported with Jeconiah king
of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon took captive.)
Mordecai had adopted Hadassah, that is, Esther, his uncle's daughter,
since she had neither father nor mother. The girl was shapely and
beautiful; and after her father and mother died, Mordecai raised her as
if she was his own daughter.
     When the king's command and decree were known, many girls were
gathered together to Susa the capital under the custody of Hegai. Esther
was also taken into the king's palace and placed under the custody of
Hegai, who had charge of the women. The girl pleased him and gained his
favour, so that he quickly gave her the cosmetics she needed to enhance
her beauty and her allowance of food and the seven maids selected from
the king's household. He also transferred her and her maids to the best
place in the harem. Esther had not revealed her people nor her family
background because Mordecai had ordered her not to. Every day Mordecai
would walk in front of the courtyard of the harem and ask after Esther's
health and what was happening to her.
     The girls were prepared for meeting King Ahasuerus for twelve
months: six months being treated with oil of myrrh and six months with
perfumes and cosmetics. After the twelve months, each girl went in to
the king. She was allowed to take with her whatever she wished from the
women's quarters, and would enter the palace in the evening and return
the next morning to another part of the harem under the care of the
king's eunuch Shaashgaz who was in charge of concubines. She would not
go to the king again unless he desired her and summoned her by name.
When it was the turn of Esther (the girl adopted by Mordecai, daughter
of his uncle Abihail) to go in to the king, she only took with her those
things that Hegai, the king's eunuch in charge of the women, had advised
her to take. Esther was liked by all who saw her. Esther was taken to
King Ahasuerus in the royal palace in the tenth month, the month of
Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign. And the king loved her more
than all the other women, and she became his favourite and won his
affection. He placed the royal diadem on her head and made her queen
instead of Vashti. Then the king gave a great feast to all his officials
and courtiers in honour of Esther, and he remitted the taxes of the
provinces and distributed gifts with royal liberality.
     All the time the virgins were assembled again, Mordecai was sitting
as an offical at the king's gate. Esther had not revealed her people or
family background because she still obeyed him as she had when he was
bringing her up.

*Hatred without Pity*

     In those days while Mordecai was sitting in the king's gate, two of
the royal court attendants, Bigthan and Teresh, who guarded the entrance
of the palace, became enraged and attempted to kill King Ahasuerus. But
Mordecai learned of the conspiracy and disclosed it to Queen Esther, and
she told the king on Mordecai's behalf. When the affair was investigated
and the facts discovered, the conspirators were both hanged on the
gallows. The incident was recorded in the presence of the king in the
daily record of events.
     After these events King Ahasuerus promoted Haman the son of
Hammedatha the Agagite, and advanced him to a place above all the
officials who were with him. All the king's courtiers who were in the
king's gate used to bow down before Haman, for so the king had
commanded, but Mordecai did not bow down nor prostrate himself.
     Then the king's courtiers, who were in the king's gate, said to
Mordecai, 'Why do you disobey the king's command?' When they had spoken
to him day after day without his listening to them, they informed Haman,
to see whether Mordecai's acts would be tolerated, for he had told them
that he was a Jew. When Haman saw that Mordecai did not bow down nor
prostrate himself before him, he was furious. But it seemed to him
beneath his dignity to lay hands on Mordecai alone, for they had told
him who Mordecai's people were. Instead Haman sought to destroy all the
people of Mordecai, all the Jews throughout the kingdom of Ahasuerus.
     In the first month (the month of Nisan) in the twelfth year of the
reign of King Ahasuerus, Haman had "pur" (which means "lot") cast before
him to determine the best day and best month for his actions. The lot
fell on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month -- the month of Adar.
     So Haman said to King Ahasuerus, 'There is a certain people
scattered among the peoples in all the provinces of your kingdom, whose
laws differ from those of every other and who do not keep the king's
laws. Therefore it is not right for the king to tolerate them. If it
seems best to the king, let an order be given to destroy them, and I
will pay ten thousand silver coins into the royal treasury.' So the king
took off his signet ring from his hand and gave it to Haman son of
Hammedatha the Agagite, the enemy of the Jews. 'The money is yours,' the
king said to Haman, 'and the people also to do with them as you wish.'
And so, on the thirteenth day of the first month, the king's secretaries
were summoned and as Haman instructed an edict was issued to the king's
satraps and provincial governors and the rulers of each of the peoples
in their own script and their own language. The edict was written in the
name of King Ahasuerus and sealed with his ring. Dispatches were sent by
couriers to all the king's provinces, saying: Destroy, kill, put an end
to all the Jews, young and old, little children and women, on the
thirteenth day of the twelfth month, and plunder their possessions. A
copy of the edict was to be published as a decree in every province --
publicly displayed so that everyone might be ready for that day. By
command of the king the couriers raced off, and the edict was published
in Susa itself.
     Then the king and Haman sat down to drink, but the city of Susa was
in turmoil.

*A Queen's Efforts to Save Her People*

     When Mordecai learned all that had been done, he tore his clothes
and put on sackcloth and strewed ashes on his head, and went out into
the city and raised a loud and bitter cry of lamentation. He went as far
as the king's gate, but no one could enter the gate clothed with
sackcloth. In every province, wherever the king's command and decree
went, there was great mourning, fasting, weeping, and wailing among the
Jews. Many of them sat in sackcloth and ashes.
     When Esther's maids and attendants told her about Mordecai's
behaviour, she was greatly troubled. She sent garments for Mordecai to
put on, so that he could take off his sack-cloth, but he would not
accept them. So Esther called Hathach, one of the king's eunuchs whom he
had appointed to attend her, and ordered him to go to Mordecai to learn
what it all meant and the reason for it.
     So Hathach went out to Mordecai, to the city square in front of the
king's gate. Mordecai told him all that had happened to him and the
exact amount of money that Haman had promised to pay into the king's
treasury for the destruction of the Jews. Also he gave him a copy of the
decree to destroy them, that had been published in Susa, to show to
Esther for her information. He also told her to go to the king and
implore his mercy and to plead with him in behalf of her people.
     When Hathach came and told Esther what Mordecai had said, she
instructed Hathach to go and say to Mordecai, 'All the king's courtiers
and the people of the king's provinces know that for every man or woman
who goes to the king into the inner court without being called there is
one penalty, death, unless the king holds out the golden sceptre
signifying that they may live. It has been thirty days since I have been
called to go in to the king.'
     When Mordecai was told what Esther had said, he sent back this
reply to Esther, 'Don't imagine that you alone of all the Jews will
escape because you belong to the king's household. If you persist in
remaining silent at this time, relief and deliverance will come to the
Jews from another quarter, but you and your family will perish. Who
knows? Maybe you have been raised to the throne for a time like this!'
     Then Esther sent this message to Mordecai: 'Go, gather all the Jews
in Susa and fast for me. Don't eat nor drink anything for three days and
nights. My maids and I will fast as well. Then I will go in to the king,
although it is contrary to the law, and if I die, I die.' Mordecai did
everything Esther had directed.
     On the third day, Esther put on her regalia and stood in the inner
court of the royal palace opposite the king's house. The king was
sitting on his throne in the palace, opposite the entrance. When he saw
Esther the queen standing in the court, she won his favour, and he held
out to her the golden sceptre that was in his hand. So Esther approached
and touched the top of the sceptre. Then the king said to her, 'What is
it, Queen Esther? Whatever your request is, it will be granted, even if
it is the half of the kingdom.'
     'If it seems best to the king,' Esther said, 'let the king and
Haman come today to the banquet that I have prepared for him.' Then the
king ordered, 'Bring Haman quickly, so that Esther's wish may be
gratified.'
     So the king and Haman went to the banquet that Esther had prepared.
While they were drinking wine, the king said to Esther, 'Whatever your
petition is, it will be granted. Your request, it will be done -- even
if it takes half of my kingdom.' Esther answered, 'If I have won the
king's favour and if it seems best to the king to grant my petition and
to accede to my request, my petition and my request are that the king
and Haman come to the banquet which I will prepare for them. Tomorrow I
will answer the king's question as he wishes.'
     Haman went out that day joyful and elated, but when he saw Mordecai
in the king's gate and noticed that he neither stood up nor moved for
him, he was furiously angry with Mordecai. Nevertheless Haman restrained
himself and went home. He called together his friends and Zeresh his
wife and recounted to them the greatness of his wealth, how many
children he had, and all the ways in which the king had honoured him,
and how he had promoted him above the officials and the royal courtiers.
'What is more,' Haman said, 'Queen Esther brought no one in with the
king to the banquet which she had prepared except me, and tomorrow also
I am invited by her along with the king. Yet all this does not satisfy
me as long as I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the king's gate.'
     Then Zeresh his wife and all his friends said to him, 'Let a
gallows seventy-five feet high be erected, and in the morning speak to
the king and let Mordecai be hanged on it. Then go merrily with the king
to the banquet.' The advice pleased Haman, and so he had the gallows
erected.

*Downfall of a Conspirator*

     On that night the king was unable to sleep, so he gave orders to
bring the books that recorded memorable deeds, and they were read before
the king. It was found recorded how Mordecai had furnished information
regarding Bigthan and Teresh, two of the king's attendants who guarded
the entrance of the palace, who had attempted to kill King Ahasuerus.
'What honour and dignity have been conferred on Mordecai for this?' the
king asked. When the king's pages who waited on him replied 'Nothing has
been done for him,' the king said, 'Who is in the court?' Now Haman had
just entered the outer court of the king's house to speak to the king
about hanging Mordecai on the gallows that he had prepared for him. So
the king's pages said to him, 'Haman is standing there, in the court.'
The king said, 'Let him enter.' So Haman entered, and the king said to
him, 'What should be done for the man whom the king wishes to honour?'
Haman said to himself, 'Whom besides me could the king wish to honour?'
So he said to the king, 'For the man whom the king wishes to honour let
a royal garment be brought, which the king has worn, and the horse on
which the king has ridden and on whose head a royal diadem has been
placed. Then let the garment and the horse be placed in charge of one of
the king's noble officials. Let him clothe the man whom the king wishes
to honour and let him lead that man on the horse through the city
square, proclaiming before him, "This is what is done for the man whom
the king wishes to honour."'
     Then the king said to Haman, 'Make haste and take the garment and
the horse, as you have said, and do this to Mordecai the Jew, who sits
in the king's gate. Omit nothing of all you have said.' So Haman took
the garment and the horse and clothed Mordecai, and made him ride
through the city square and proclaimed before him, 'This is what is done
for the man whom the king wishes to honour.'
     Mordecai returned to the king's gate, but Haman hurried to his
house, mourning, with his head covered. Haman recounted to Zeresh his
wife and to all his friends everything that had happened to him. Then
his wise men and Zeresh his wife said to him, 'If Mordecai before whom
you have already been humiliated is of the Jewish people, you can do
nothing against him but will surely fall before him.'
     While they were still talking with him, the king's attendants came
and quickly took Haman to the banquet that Esther had prepared.
     So the king and Haman went to drink with Queen Esther. As they were
drinking wine on that second day, the king again said to Esther,
'Whatever your petition is, Queen Esther, it will be granted to you.
Whatever you request it will be done, even if it takes half of the
kingdom.' Then Queen Esther answered, 'Your Majesty, if I have won your
favour, and if it seems best to Your Majesty, let my life be given me as
my petition, and my people as my request, for I and my people have been
sold to be destroyed, killed, and completely annihilated! If we had been
merely sold into slavery I would not have disturbed your peace, because
such a fate would not have affected the interests of the king.'
     Then King Ahasuerus said to Queen Esther, 'Who is he and where is
he whose heart has impelled him to do this?'
     'A foe, an enemy: this wicked Haman.' Esther answered. Haman shrank
in terror before the king and the queen. In his wrath the king rose from
the place where he was drinking wine and went into the palace garden.
Haman stayed to beg Queen Esther for his life, for he saw that the king
was fully determined to bring calamity upon him. As the king returned
from the palace garden to the banquet hall, Haman had flung himself on
Esther's couch. The king cried, 'Is he going to rape my queen while I am
present in my own house?'
     As the king spoke these words, the attendants covered Haman's face
and Harbonah, one of those who waited on the king, said, 'There are the
gallows, seventy-five feet high, which Hainan erected for Mordecai, who
spoke a good word in behalf of the king, standing in the house of
Haman!' The king said 'Hang him on them.' So they hanged Haman on the
gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai. Then the wrath of the king
was pacified.

*Deliverance of the Jews*

     At that time King Ahasuerus gave the property of Haman the Jews'
enemy to Queen Esther. Mordecai was made one of the king's personal
advisers, for Esther had disclosed his relationship to her. The king
also drew off his signet ring, which he had taken from Haman. He gave it
to Mordecai, and Esther placed Mordecai in charge of Haman's property.
     Then Esther sought another audience with the king and fell at his
feet and with tears begged him to avert the evil planned by Haman the
Agagite and to frustrate his designs against the Jews. The king held out
to her the golden sceptre, and she arose and stood before him. 'If it
seems best to the king,' she said, 'and if I have won his favour and he
thinks it right, and if I please him, let written orders be given to
revoke the dispatches devised by Haman son of Hammedatha the Agagite,
which he wrote ordering the destruction of the Jews who are in all the
king's provinces. For how can I bear to look upon the evil that will
come to my people? How can I bear to see their destruction?' Then King
Ahasuerus said to Queen Esther and to Mordecai the Jew, 'See, I have
given Esther the property of Haman, and they have hanged him on the
gallows, because he laid hands upon the Jews. Now you write on behalf of
the Jews, as seems best to you, in the king's name and seal it with the
king's signet ring. For a document that is written in the king's name
and sealed with the king's signet ring cannot be revoked.'
     On the twenty-third day of the third month (that is the month of
Sivan), the king's secretaries were summoned and as Mordecai instructed
an edict was issued to the Jews, to the satraps and provincial governors
and the rulers of each of the one hundred twenty-seven provinces from
India to Ethiopia in their own script and their own language, and to the
Jews in their own script and language.
     Mordecai wrote in the name of King Ahasuerus. He sealed it with the
king's signet ring. Dispatches were sent by mounted couriers who rode
the swift, noble steeds, bred of the royal studs. In this way the king
permitted the Jews who were in every city to gather together and make a
stand for their life, to destroy, to kill, and annihilate all the armed
forces of any people or province that might be hostile to them,
including their children and women, and to take their goods as plunder
throughout all the provinces of King Ahasuerus on that thirteenth day of
the twelfth month (which is called Adar). A copy of the edict was to be
published as a decree in every province -- publicly displayed so that
the Jews might be ready for that day and avenge themselves. So the
couriers who rode the swift, noble steeds went out, hastened and
impelled by the king's commands!
     Meantime the decree had been given out in the royal palace at Susa;
and Mordecai had gone out from the presence of the king in royal
garments of violet and white and with a great crown of gold and with a
robe of fine linen and purple. The people of Susa shouted and were glad.
To the Jews there came light and gladness and joy and honour. And in
every province and city, wherever the king's command and decree came,
there was gladness and joy among the Jews and a holiday. Many of the
peoples of the earth professed to be Jews, for fear of the Jews took
possession of them.
     Now in the twelfth month (that is the month of Adar), on the
thirteenth day, when the king's command and his decree was about to put
into execution, on the day that the enemies of the Jews hoped to gain
the mastery over them, then the tables were turned so that the Jews had
the mastery over those who hated them. The Jews gathered together in the
cities throughout all the provinces of King Ahasuerus, to attack anyone
who tried to harm them. No one could withstand them, for the fear of
them had fallen on all the peoples. All the princes of the provinces and
the satraps and the governors and they who attended to the king's
business, helped the Jews, because the fear of Mordecai had fallen on
them. For Mordecai was great in the king's palace, and as his power
increased his fame spread throughout all the provinces. The Jews put all
their enemies to the sword and, with slaughter and destruction, they did
what they wanted to those who hated them. In Susa the capital the Jews
killed five hundred people. They killed Parshandatha, Dalphon, Aspatha,
Poratha, Adalia, Aridatha, Parmashta, Arisia, Aridai, and Vaizatha, the
ten sons of Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Jews' enemy; but they did
not take any plunder.
     On that day the number of those who were slain in Susa was brought
before the king, and the king said to Queen Esther, 'The Jews have slain
five hundred people in Susa, and the ten sons of Haman. What then have
they done in the rest of the king's provinces! Now what is your
petition? It will be granted to you. What is your request? It will be
done.'
     'If it please the king,' Esther said, 'let it be granted to the
Jews who are in Susa to do tomorrow also according to this day's decree.
Let the bodies of Haman's ten sons be hanged on the gallows.' And the
king commanded it to be done. A decree was given out in Susa and they
hung the bodies of Haman's ten sons on the gallows. The Jews who were in
Susa gathered themselves together again on the fourteenth day of the
month of Adar. They killed three hundred people in Susa. But they did
not take any plunder. And the other Jews who were in the king's
provinces gathered themselves together and fought for their lives and
overcame their enemies. They killed seventy-five thousand who hated
them. But they did not take any plunder. This was on the thirteenth day
of Adar.

     On the fourteenth day of the month Adar the Jews rested and made it
a day of feasting and rejoicing. (But the Jews in Susa gathered on both
the thirteenth and fourteenth day -- and rested on the fifteenth day of
the same month and made it a day of feasting and rejoicing.)
     This is why the Jews who live in the country villages keep the
fourteenth day of the month of Adar as a day of rejoicing and feasting
and a holiday, and a day in which they send gifts of food to each other.

*The Establishment of Purim*

     Mordecai had these things recorded. He sent letters to all the Jews
who were in all the provinces of the King Ahasuerus, both near and far.
He told them to keep the fourteenth day of the month of Adar and also
the fifteenth day every year, as the days on which the Jews had rest
from their enemies, and the month which was turned from sorrow to
gladness and from mourning into a feast day. They should make them days
of feasting and gladness and of sending gifts of food to each other and
of gifts to the poor.
     So what the Jews had begun to do they adopted as a custom, just as
Mordecai had written to them. For Haman the son of Hammedatha, the
Agagite, the enemy of all the Jews, had plotted to destroy them. He had
cast "Pur", that is the lot, intending to consume them and to destroy
them. But when the matter came before the king, he gave written orders
that his wicked plot, which he had planned against the Jews, should come
upon his own head, and that he and his sons should be hanged on the
gallows. This is why these days are called Purim, after the word Pur.
Therefore because of all the words of this letter, as well as all they
had seen, and all they had experienced, the Jews established and made it
a custom for them, for their descendants, and for all who should join
them, so that it might not be repealed, that they should continue to
observe these two days as feasts each year, and that these days should
be remembered and kept throughout every generation, every family, every
province, and every city. And these days of Purim should not pass away
from among the Jews nor the remembrance of them disappear among their
descendants.
     Queen Esther, the daughter of Abihail, gave Mordecai the Jew all
authority in writing to confirm this second letter of Purim. He sent
letters to all the Jews, to the hundred and twenty-seven provinces of
the kingdom of Ahasuerus, wishing them peace and security, to confirm
these days of Purim in their proper times, to be observed as Mordecai
the Jew and Queen Esther had directed and as the Jews had proscribed for
themselves and their descendants, in the matter of the fastings and
their cry of lamentation. And the commands of Esther confirmed these
matters of Purim; and it was written in the records.

     King Ahasuerus imposed a tribute on the land and the coasts. All
the acts of his power and of his might, and the full account of the
greatness of Mordecai to which the king advanced him, are they not
recorded in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Media and Persia?
For Mordecai the Jew was next in rank to King Ahasuerus, and great among
the Jews, and loved by them all. He sought the good of his people and
promoted the welfare of their descendants.

                                 PSALMS


                               [Book One]



*Psalm 1 -- The Way of Happiness*


     Happy are those
         who do not follow the counsel of the wicked,
     not halting in ways frequented by sinners,
         nor taking a seat in a gathering of scoffers.
     But the law of the LORD is their joy,
         they study it day and night.
     They are like trees
         planted by runlets of water,
     yielding fruit in due season,
         leaves never fading.
         In all that they do, they prosper.


     Not so fare the wicked, not so;
         like chaff are they, blown by the wind.
     So the wicked will not stand firm in the judgment,
         nor sinners appear, when the righteous are gathered.
     For the way of the righteous is dear to the LORD,
         but the way of the wicked will end in ruin.

*Psalm 2 -- The Lord's Chosen King*


     Why this turmoil of nations,
         this futile plotting of peoples,
     with kings of the earth conspiring,
         and rulers consulting together,
         against the LORD and against his anointed,
     to snap their bonds
         and fling their cords away?


     He whose throne is in heaven laughs,
         the LORD mocks them.
     Then he speaks to them in his wrath,
         and in his hot anger confounds them.
     'This my king is installed by me,
         on Zion my holy mountain.'


     I will tell of the LORD's decree.
     He said to me: 'You are my son,
         this day I became your father.
     Only ask, and I make you the heir of the nations,
         and lord of the world to its utmost bounds.
     You will break them with sceptre of iron,
         shatter them like pottery.'


     So now, you kings, be wise:
         be warned, you rulers of earth.
     Serve the LORD in awe,
         kiss his feet with trembling,
     lest, angry, he hurl you to ruin;
         for soon will his fury blaze.
         Happy all who take refuge in him.

*Psalm 3 -- A Morning Prayer for Protection*
     A psalm of David, when he fled from his son Absalom.

     How many, LORD, are my foes!
         Those who rise up against me are many.
     Many are those who say of me,
         'There is no help for him in his God.' Selah


     But you, LORD, are shield about me,
         my glory, who lifts up my head.
     When loudly I call to the LORD,
         from his holy hill he gives answer. Selah


     I laid down and slept:
         now I wake, for the LORD sustains me.
     I fear not the myriads of people
         who beset me on every side.


     Arise, LORD: save me, my God,
         who strikes all my foes on the cheek,
         and shatters the teeth of the wicked.
     Victory belongs to the LORD:
         let your blessing descend on your people. Selah

*Psalm 4 -- An Evening Prayer*
     For the leader, with stringed instruments. A psalm of David.

     Answer my cry,
         God, my defender.
     Often from straits you have brought me
         to spacious places.
     So now show me your favour
         and hear my prayer.


     How long, you proud people,
         will my honour be stained
     by the slanders you love,
         and the lies that you follow? Selah
     See! The LORD has shown me
         his wonderful kindness:
     the LORD hears,
         when I call to him.


     Sin not in your anger:
         but speak in your heart
         on your bed, and be still. Selah
     Offer true sacrifice,
         trust in the LORD.


     Many are longing
         for fortune to smile.
     Lift upon us
         the light of your face.
     You have put in my heart, LORD,
         a deeper joy
     than was theirs who had corn
         and wine in abundance.


     So in peace I will
         lie down and sleep;
     for you, LORD, keep me
         safe.

*Psalm 5 -- A Prayer for Guidance*
     For the leader: A psalm of David, to be accompanied by the flute.

     Hear my words, LORD:
         give heed to my whisper.
     Attend to my loud cry for help,
         my king and my God.
     When I pray to you, LORD, in the morning,
         hear my voice.
     I make ready for you in the morning,
         and look for a sign.


     For you are no God who takes pleasure in wickedness:
         no one of evil can be your guest.
     No braggarts can stand in your presence,
         you hate all workers of wrong.
     You destroy all speakers of lies,
         people of blood and deceit you abhor.
     But I, through your kindness abundant,
         may enter your house,
     and towards the shrine of your temple
         may reverently bow.


     Lead me, LORD, in your righteousness
         because of my enemies.
         Make your way level before me.
     For their mouth is a stranger to truth,
         their heart is a pit of destruction.
     Their throat is a wide open grave,
         their tongue the smooth tongue of the hypocrite.


     Condemn them, God;
         let their schemes bring them down to the ground.
     For their numberless crimes thrust them down
         for playing the rebel against you.
     But let all who take refuge in you
         ring out their gladness forever.
     Protect those who love your name,
         so they may exult in you.
     For you give your blessing, LORD, to the godly,
         and the shield of your favour protects them.

*Psalm 6 -- A Cry for Help in Time of Trouble*
     For the leader; with instrumental music on the sheminith. A psalm
of David.

     Rebuke me not, LORD, in your anger,
         punish me not in your wrath.
     LORD, be gracious to me
         in my weakness.
     Heal me LORD,
         for racked is my body;
     all of me utterly racked.
         Why do you wait so long, LORD?


     Turn, LORD, rescue me;
         save me, because of your love.
     For in death none can call you to mind;
         in Sheol who can praise you?


     I am so weary of sighing.
         All the night I make my bed swim,
         and wet my couch with my tears.
     My eyes swollen with grief;
         from weeping caused by my foes.


     Begone, workers of wrong,
         for the LORD has heard my loud weeping,
     the LORD has heard my entreaty,
         the LORD accepts my prayer.
     My foes will be stricken with terror,
         brought to shame and dismay in a moment.

*Psalm 7 -- A Prayer to the God of Justice*
     A Shiggaion of David, which he sang to the LORD about Cush, the
Benjamite.

     LORD my God, I take refuge in you.
     Deliver me, save me from all who pursue me;
         or like lions they will tear me to pieces,
         and rend me, past hope of rescue.


     LORD, my God, if my life has been such
         if my hands have been stained with guilt,
         if friends I paid back with evil,
         if I plundered my foes without cause,
     may the enemy chase and find me,
          trample my life to the ground,
         my honour leave in the dirt! Selah


     Arise, LORD, in anger,
         against my foes rise in fury.
     Awake for my help:
         let justice be done.
     Gather the nations about you,
         and sit on your lofty throne,
         as the LORD, the judge of the peoples.
     Judge me, LORD, in my innocence
         and according to my integrity.


     Put an end to the wrong of the wicked,
         protect the righteous.
     Searcher of hearts and minds,
         righteous God.
     God is my shield:
         he saves the upright in heart.


     God is a just judge,
         constant in righteous anger.
     He will sharpen his sword without fail,
         his bow is bent and ready,
     his deadly weapons are ready,
         his arrows he makes of flame.


     The enemy who conceives evil;
         pregnant with mischief,
         giving birth to lies,
     a pit they have made and dug;
         but into the hole that they made they will fall.
     On their own heads their mischief comes back;
         on their own skulls their violence comes down.
     I will give thanks to the LORD for his justice,
         and sing to the name of the LORD Most High.

*Psalm 8 -- God's Glory in Nature*
     For the leader: A psalm of David, to be accompanied by a stringed
instrument.

     LORD our God!
         How glorious in all the earth is your name!
     Your praise reaches as high as the heavens,
         from the mouths of children and infants.


     You have built a fortress
         against your enemies,
     to silence the foe and the rebel.


     When I look at your heavens,
         the work of your fingers,
     the moon and the stars,
         which you have set there,
     what are mortals,
         that you think of them,
     humans,
         that you visit them?


     Yet you made them little less than divine,
         crowned them with glory and majesty,
     made them lord of the works of your hands,
         put all things under their feet --
     sheep and oxen,
         all of them;
     and the wild beasts also:
         birds of the air,
         and fish of the sea,
         and all that crosses the paths of the ocean.


     LORD our God!
         How glorious in all the earth is your name!

*Psalm 9 -- A Song of Praise the Lord's Justice*
     For the leader; 'almuth labben. A psalm of David.

     With all my heart I will praise the LORD,
         all your wonders I will rehearse.
     I will rejoice and exult in you,
         singing praise to your name, Most High;
     because backward my foes were turned,
         they stumbled and perished before you.


     My right and my claim you have upheld,
         you did sit on the throne as a fair judge,
     rebuking the nations, destroying the wicked,
         and blotting their name out forever and ever.
     The foe is vanished, ruined forever,
         their cities destroyed, their memory perished.


     See! The LORD is seated forever
         on the throne he established for judgment,
     ruling the world with justice,
         and judging the nations with equity.


     So the LORD proves a haven to the oppressed,
         a haven in times of trouble.
     Well may they trust you who know your name,
         for those who seek you, you never abandon.


     Sing praise to the LORD, whose home is in Zion,
         declare his deeds among the nations.
     As avenger of blood, he keeps them in mind,
         he does not forget the cry of the wretched.


     Show me favour, LORD,
         see how my foes afflict me,
         lift me up from the gates of death;
     so I may, in your help exulting,
         tell forth your praise at the gates of Zion.


     The nations are sunk in the pit which they made,
         in the net that they hid, their own foot is entangled.
     The LORD is revealed in the judgment he wrought,
         the wicked are snared in their own handiwork. Selah


     Let the wicked depart to Sheol,
         all the nations that live forgetful of God.
     For the needy will not be always forgotten,
         nor the hope of the helpless be lost forever.


     Arise, LORD; don't let them triumph:
         before your face let the nations be judged.
     Strike them with fear, LORD:
         show the nations how frail they are. Selah

*Psalm 10 -- A Prayer for Help*


     Why do you stand, LORD, so far away,
         hiding yourself in times of trouble?
     The wicked, in their pride, are pursuing the helpless:
         let them be caught in the schemes they have plotted.


     For the wicked boasts of their wanton greed;
         the robber despises the LORD, and curses him,
     in wicked pride, thinks:
         God doesn't care,
         God doesn't call to account.


     Never a season that they do not prosper;
         your judgments are far above out of their sight:
         they scoff at their foes.


     Each says in their heart,
         'I will never be shaken;
     I will live for all time
         untouched by misfortune.'
     Their mouths are full of deceit and oppression:
         under their tongues lurks mischief and wrong.


     Lying in secret in some village ambush,
         and stealthily watching, they murder the innocent.
     Like a lion that lurks in a secret lair
         they lurk intending to catch the defenceless;
         to seize them, to drag them away in their net.


     Their victims are crushed,
         sink down to the ground.
     Under their claws
         the hapless fall.
     The wicked say in their hearts
         that God has forgotten,
     has hidden his face,
         will see nothing.


     Arise, LORD, lift up your hand,
         do not forget the cry of the wretched.
     Why do the wicked treat God with contempt,
         and say in their hearts, 'God doesn't care'?


     You have seen the trouble and sorrow;
         you mark it all, and will take it in hand.
     The hapless can count on you,
         helper of orphans.


     Break the arm of the wicked and evil:
         search out their sin, till no more be found.
     The LORD is king forever and ever:
         the nations will vanish from his land.


     LORD, you have heard the desire of the humble,
         inclining your ear, strengthening their hearts,
     rights you have won for the crushed and the orphan,
         so no one on earth may strike terror again.

*Psalm 11 -- Trust in the Lord*
     For the leader. Of David.

     In the LORD I take refuge.
         How can you tell me
     to flee like a bird to the mountains?


     'See! The wicked are bending the bow,
         their arrow is set on the string,
         to shoot from the shadows at the upright in heart.
     In this tearing down of foundations
         what good can a good person do?'


     The LORD in his holy temple,
         the LORD in heaven, enthroned.
     His eyes watch the world,
         they see everyone.
     The LORD examines the righteous and wicked,
         and the lover of violence he hates.
     On the wicked he rains coals of fire and brimstone,
         and their drink will be scorching wind.
     For the LORD is just, and justice he loves;
         so the upright will see his face.

*Psalm 12 -- A Prayer for the Faithful in a False World*
     For the leader; on the sheminith. A psalm of David.

     Help, LORD, for the good are all gone,
         faithful people have vanished.
     One lies to another, speaking empty lies,
         with flattering lips and false hearts they speak.


     May the LORD cut off all the flattering lips,
         and the tongue that utters arrogance,
     they declare, 'Our tongue is our strength,
         our allies our lips: who is lord over us?'


     'The poor are despoiled, and the needy are sighing;
         so now I will act,' the LORD declares
         'And place them in the safety they long for.'


     The words of the LORD are words that are pure,
         silver smelted, seven times refined.
     You will keep us, LORD,
         and guard us from this generation forever,
     in a world where the wicked prowl,
         and worthless people exalted.

*Psalm 13 -- A Prayer for Help in Trouble*
     For the leader. A psalm of David.

     How long, LORD, will you forget me forever?
         How long will you hide your face from me?
     How long must I nurse grief inside me,
         and in my heart a daily sorrow?
         How long are my foes to exult over me?


     Look at me, answer me, LORD my God.
     Fill my eyes with your light,
         lest I sleep in death,
         lest my enemies claim to have triumphed,
         lest my foes rejoice at my downfall.


     But I trust in your kindness:
         my heart will rejoice in your help.
         I will sing to the LORD who was good to me.

*Psalm 14 -- The Folly of Denying God*
     For the leader. Of David.

     Fools say in their heart,
         'There is no God.'
     Vile, hateful their life is;
         not one does good.


     From heaven the LORD looks out
         on humans, to see
     if any are wise,
         and care for God.


     But all have turned bad,
         the taint is on all;
     not one does good,
         no, not one.


     Have they learned their lesson,
         those workers of evil?
     Who ate up my people,
         eating, devouring,
         never calling to the LORD.


     Sore afraid will they be;
         for God is among
         those who are righteous,
     you may mock the plans of the poor,
         but the LORD is their refuge.


     If only help from Zion
         would come for Israel!
     When the LORD brings his people
         a change of fortune,
     how glad will be Jacob,
         and Israel how joyful!

*Psalm 15 -- Standing Firm*
     A psalm of David.

     LORD, who can be guest in your tent?
         Who may live on your holy mountain?


     The person whose walk is blameless,
         whose conduct is right,
     whose words are true and sincere;
         on whose tongue there sits no slander,
     who will not harm a friend,
         nor cruelly insult a neighbour,
     who regards with contempt those rejected by God;
         but honours those who obey the LORD,
     who keeps an oath, whatever the cost,
         whose money is lent without interest,
     and never takes a bribe to hurt the innocent.


     The person who does these things will always stand firm.

*Psalm 16 -- The Joy of Fellowship with God*
     A michtam of David.

     Keep me, O God, for in you I take refuge.
         I said to the LORD, 'You are my LORD,
     my happiness rests in you alone.
     Those who are holy in the land,
         they, they alone, are the noble ones;
         all my delight is in them.'


     Those who choose other gods
         find endless sorrow.
     In their offerings of blood I will have no part
         nor take their name on my lips.
     The LORD is my share and my portion,
         my fate is in your strong hands.


     The boundary lines of my life
         mark out delightful country,
         my heritage pleases me well.
     I praise the LORD for his counsel,
         which so stirs my heart in the night.
     I keep the LORD always in mind:
         with him at my hand, I can never be moved.


     So my heart is glad, there is joy inside me;
         and in safety of body I live.
     For you will not give me up to Sheol
         nor let any who love you see the pit.
     You will show me the path that leads to life,
         to that fulness of joy which is in your presence,
         and the pleasures dispensed by your hand evermore.

*Psalm 17 -- A Prayer for Deliverance*
     A prayer of David.

     Listen, O LORD, to my innocence;
         attend to my piercing cry.
     Give heed to my prayer
         out of lips unfeigned.
     Let my vindication come from you,
         your eyes see the truth.


     When you test my heart when you visit at night,
         and assay me like silver -- you can find no evil.
     I am determined that my mouth should not lie.
         I gave earnest heed to the words of your lips.
     My steps have held fast to the paths of your precepts
         and in your tracks have my feet never stumbled.


     So I call you, O God, with assurance of answer;
         bend down your ear to me, hear what I say.
     Show your marvellous love, you who save from enemies
         those who take refuge at your right hand.


     Keep me as the apple of the eye,
         hide me in the shelter of your wings.
     From wicked people who do me violence,
         from deadly foes who crowd around me.


     They have closed their hearts to pity,
         the words of their mouths are haughty.
     Now they dog us at every step,
         keenly watching, to hurl us to the ground,
     like a lion, longing to tear,
         like a young lion, lurking in secret.


     Arise, LORD, face them and fell them.
         By your sword set me free from the wicked,
     by your hand, O LORD, from those --
         whose portion of life is but of this world.
     But let your treasured ones have food in plenty
     may their children be full and their children satisfied.


         In my innocence I will see your face,
     awake I am filled with a vision of you.

*Psalm 18 -- A King's Song of Gratitude*
     For the leader. Of David, the servant of the LORD, who recited the
words of this song to the LORD after the LORD had saved him from the
power of all his enemies and from the hand of Saul. He said:

     I love you, O LORD, my strength.
     The LORD is my rock, my fortress, deliverer,
         my God, my rock, where I take refuge,
         my shield, my defender, my tower.
     Worthy of praise is the LORD whom I call on,
         he rescues me from all my foes.


     The waves of death broke about me,
         fearful floods of chaos.
     Sheol threw cords around me,
         snares of death came to meet me.
     In distress I cried to the LORD,
         and shouted for help to my God;
     in his temple he heard my voice,
         into his ears came my cry.


     Then the earth shook and quaked,
         mountains trembled to their foundations,
         and quaked because of his wrath.
     Smoke went up from his nostrils,
         devouring fire from his mouth,
         coals were kindled by it.


     Then he bent the sky and came down,
         thick darkness was under his feet.
     He rode on a cherub and flew,
         darting on wings of wind,
     with his screen of darkness about him,
         in thick dark clouds of water.


     At the radiance before him there passed
         hailstones and coals of fire.
     The LORD thundered from heaven,
         the Most High uttered his voice.
     He shot his arrows and scattered them,
         flashed lightnings, and routed them.
     The channels of the sea were revealed,
         the world was laid bare to its base,
     at your rebuke, O LORD,
         at the blast of the breath of your nostrils.


     He stretched from on high, he seized me,
         drew me up from the mighty waters,
     and saved me from those who hated me --
         fierce foes, too mighty for me.
     In my day of distress they assailed me,
         but the LORD proved my support.
     To a spacious place he brought me,
         and, for love of me, he saved me.


     The LORD repays my innocence,
         he rewards my cleanness of hands.
     For I kept the ways of the LORD,
         nor have wickedly strayed from my God.
     His commandments were all before me,
         his statutes I put not away.
     And I was blameless before him,
         guarding myself from sin.
     So the LORD repaid my innocence,
         my cleanness of hands in his sight.


     With the loyal you are loyal,
         and with the blameless blameless.
     With the pure you show yourself pure,
         but shrewd with the devious.
     For the lowly people you save,
         but haughty eyes you abase.
     You are my lamp, LORD,
         my God who enlightens my darkness.
     With you I can storm a rampart,
         with my God I can leap a wall.
     As for God, his way is perfect;
         the word of the LORD is pure.
         He is shield to all who take refuge in him.


     For who is God but the LORD?
         And who is a rock but our God?
     The God who arms me with strength,
         who cleared and smoothed my way.
     He made my feet like hinds' feet,
         and set me up on the heights.
     He taught my hands how to fight,
         and my arms how to bend a bronze bow.


     The shield of your help you gave me,
         your right hand supports me,
         you stoop down to make me great.
     In your strength I took giant strides,
         and my feet never slipped.
     So I chased the foe till I caught them,
         and turned not, till I made an end of them.
     I smashed them, they could not rise,
         they fell beneath my feet.


     You did arm me with strength for war,
         you did bow my assailants beneath me.
     You made my foes turn their back to me,
         and those who did hate me I finished.
     They cried for help, but none saved them;
         to the LORD, but he answered them not.
     I beat them like dust of the market-place,
         stamped them like mud of the streets.


     From the strife of the peoples you saved me,
         you made me head of the nations,
         peoples I knew not did serve me.
     On the instant they hear, they obey me,
         foreigners come to me cringing.
     Foreigners lose courage,
         and come out of their strongholds trembling.


     The LORD is alive! Blest be my rock!
         Exalted be God, my protector!
     The God who gave me revenge,
         and brought down nations beneath me,
     who saved me from angry foes,
         and set me above my assailants,
         safe from the violent.


     For this I will praise you among the nations,
         making music, O LORD, to your name:
     for great triumphs he grants to his king,
         and faithful love he shows his anointed,
         to David and his seed evermore.

*Psalm 19 -- The Glory of God in the Heavens*
     For the leader. A psalm of David.

     The heavens declare God's glory,
         the sky tells what his hands have done.
     Day tells it to day,
         night reveals it to night,
     without speaking, without words;
         without the sound of voices.
     But through all the world their voice carries
         their words to the ends of the earth.


     He has pitched a tent for the sun in the sky,
         it comes out like a bridegroom from his bridal chamber,
     it joyfully runs its course like a hero.
         From one end of the heavens it rises,
     and round it runs to the other,
         and nothing hides from its heat.

*In Praise of the Law*


     The law of the LORD is perfect,
         renewing life.
     The decrees of the LORD are trusty,
         making the simple wise.


     The behests of the LORD are right,
         rejoicing the heart.
     The command of the LORD is pure,
         giving light to the eyes.


     The fear of the LORD is clean,
         it endures forever.
     The LORD's judgments are true
         and right altogether.


     More precious are they than gold --
         than fine gold in plenty,
     and sweeter they are than honey,
         that drops from the comb.


     By them is your servant warned;
         who keeps them has rich reward.
     Who can know their flaws?
         Absolve me from those I know not.


     Keep your servant from wilful sins --
         from falling under their sway:
     then blameless and clear will I be
         from great offence.


     May the words of my mouth and the thoughts of my heart
         be pleasing to you, LORD,
         my rock and redeemer.

*Psalm 20 -- A Prayer for Victory*
     For the leader. A psalm of David.

     The LORD answer you in the day of distress,
         the name of the Jacob's God protect you,
     sending you help from the temple,
         out of Zion supporting you.


     All your meal-offerings may he remember,
         your burnt-offerings look on with favour. Selah
     May he grant you your heart's desire,
         and bring all your plans to pass.
     We will shout then for joy at your victory,
         and rejoice in the name of our God.
         May the LORD grant your every request.


     Now I am sure that the LORD
         will help his anointed.
     From his temple in heaven he will answer
         by his mighty triumphant right hand.
     Some in chariots are strong, some in horses;
         but our strength is the LORD our God.
     They will totter and fall,
         while we rise and stand firm.


     Give victory, LORD, to the king,
         and answer us when we call.

*Psalm 21 -- A Prayer after a Victory*
     For the leader. A psalm of David.

     The king rejoices, LORD, in your might,
         how he exults because of your help!
     You have granted to him his heart's desire,
         you have not withheld his lips' request. Selah


     You came to meet him with rich blessings,
         you set on his head a golden crown.
     He asked you for life, you gave it --
         many long days, forever and ever.


     Great is his glory because of your help,
         honour and majesty you lay upon him.
     For you make him most blessed forever,
         you make him glad with the joy of your presence.


     For the king puts always his trust in the LORD;
         the Most High, in his love, will preserve him unshaken.
     Your hand will reach all your foes,
         your right hand, all who hate you.
     You will make them like a furnace of fire,
         when you appear, LORD.
     The LORD will swallow them up in his wrath.
         The fire will devour them.
     You will sweep their offspring from the earth,
         their children from humanity.
     When they scheme against you
         and hatch evil plots -- they will fail.
     For you aim your bow at their faces,
         make them turn in flight.


     Be exalted, LORD, in your strength,
     to your might we shall sing and make music.

*Psalm 22 -- The Sufferer's Triumph*
     For the leader; set to "Deer of the Dawn". A psalm of David.

     My God, my God, why have you left me,
         my rescue so far from the words of my roaring?
     I cry in the day, you do not answer,
     I cry in the night but find no rest.


     You are the Holy One,
         throned on the praises of Israel.
     In you our ancestors trusted,
         they trusted and you delivered them.
     They cried to you, and found safety,
         in you did they trust and were not put to shame.


     But I am a worm, not a person;
         insulted by others, despised by the people.
     All who see me mock me,
         with mouths wide open and wagging heads:
     'He relies on the LORD; let him save him.
         Let him rescue the one he holds dear!'


     But you drew me from the womb,
         laid me safely on my mother's breasts.
     On your care was I cast from my very birth,
         you are my God from my mother's womb.
     Be not far from me, for trouble is nigh,
     and there is none to help.


     I am circled by many bulls,
         beset by the mighty of Bashan,
     who face me with gaping jaws,
         like ravening roaring lions.
     Poured out am I like water,
         and all my bones are loosened.
     My heart is become like wax,
         melted within me.


     My palate is dry as a sherd,
         my tongue sticks to my jaws;
         in the dust of death you lay me.
     For dogs are round about me,
         a band of knaves encircles me,
         gnawing my hands and my feet.
     I can count my bones, every one.
         As for them, they feast their eyes on me.
     They divide my garments among them,
         and over my raiment cast lots.


     But you, O LORD, be not far,
         O my strength, hasten to help me.
     Deliver my life from the sword
         my life from the power of the dogs.
     Save me from the jaws of the lion,
         from the horns of the wild oxen help me.


     I will tell of your fame to my kindred,
         and in the assembly will praise you.
     Praise the LORD, you who fear him.
         All Jacob's seed, give him glory.
         All Israel's seed, stand in awe of him.


     For he has not despised nor abhorred
         the sorrow of the sorrowful.
     He hid not his face from me,
         but he listened to my cry for help.


     Of you is my praise in the great congregation;
         my vows I will pay before those who fear him.
     The afflicted will eat to their heart's desire,
         and those who seek after the LORD will praise him.
         Lift up your hearts forever.
     All will call it to mind, to the ends of the earth,
         and turn to the LORD;
     and all tribes of the nations will bow down before you.
     For the kingdom belongs to the LORD:
         he is the LORD of the nations.
     To him will bow down all who sleep in the earth,
         and before him bend all who go down to the dust,
         and those who could not preserve their lives.
     My descendants will tell of the LORD
         to the next generation;
     they will declare his righteousness
         to people yet to be born:
         He has done it.

*Psalm 23 -- The Good Shepherd*
     A psalm of David.

     The LORD is my shepherd: I am never in need.
         He lays me down in green pastures.
     He gently leads me to waters of rest,
         he refreshes my life.
     He guides me along paths that are straight,
         true to his name.


     And when my way lies through a valley of gloom,
         I fear no evil, for you are with me.
     Your rod and your staff comfort me.


     You spread a table for me
         in face of my foes;
     with oil you anoint my head,
         and my cup runs over.
     Surely goodness and love will pursue me --
         all the days of my life.
     In the house of the LORD I will live
         through the length of the days.

*Psalm 24 -- The True Worshipper*
     Of David. A psalm.

     The earth is the LORD's and all that it holds,
         the world and those who live in it.
     For he founded it on the seas,
         and on the floods he sustains it.


     Who may ascend the hill of the LORD?
         Who may stand in his holy place?
     The clean of hands, the pure of heart,
         who sets not their heart upon sinful things,
         nor swears with intent to deceive:
     they win from the LORD a blessing:
         God is their champion and saviour.
     Such must be those who resort to him,
         and seek the face of the God of Jacob. Selah

*The Lords's Triumphal Entry into the Sanctuary*


     Lift high your heads, you gates --
         Higher, you ancient doors;
         welcome the glorious king.
     'Who is the glorious king?'
         'The LORD strong and heroic,
         the LORD heroic in battle.'


     Lift high your heads, you gates --
         Higher, you ancient doors;
         welcome the glorious king.
     'Who is the glorious king?'
         'The LORD, the God of hosts,
         he is the glorious king.' Selah

*Psalm 25 -- A Prayer for Forgiveness and Protection*
     A psalm of David.

     To you, O LORD, I lift up my heart:
         all the day I wait for you.
     In you I trust, put me not to shame;
         let not my foes exult over me.
     None will be shamed who wait for you,
         but shame will fall upon wanton traitors.
     Make me, O LORD, to know your ways:
         teach me your paths.
     In your faithfulness guide me and teach me,
         for you are my God and my saviour.
     Remember your pity, O LORD, and your kindness,
         for they have been ever of old.
     Do not remember the sins of my youth;
         remember me in kindness,
         because of your goodness, LORD.
     Good is the LORD and upright,
         so he teaches sinners the way.
     The humble he guides in the right,
         he teaches the humble his way.
     All his ways are loving and loyal
         to those who observe his charges and covenant.
     Be true to your name LORD,
         forgive my many sins.
     Who then is the person who fears the LORD?
         He will teach them the way to choose.
     They will live in prosperity,
         their children will inherit the land.
     The LORD gives guidance to those who fear him,
         and with his covenant he makes them acquainted.
     My eyes are ever toward the LORD,
         for out of the net he brings my foot.
     Turn to me with your favour,
         for I am lonely and crushed
     In my heart are strain and storm;
         bring me out of my distresses.
     Look on my misery and trouble,
         and pardon all my sins,
     look on my foes oh, so many!
         And their cruel hatred towards me.
     Deliver me, keep me, and shame not
         one who takes refuge in you.
     May integrity and innocence preserve me,
         for I wait for you, O LORD.


     Redeem Israel, O God,
         from all its distresses.

*Psalm 26 -- Prayer of a Devout Worshipper*
     A psalm of David.

     Defend me, O LORD, for my walk has been blameless;
         in the LORD have I trusted unswervingly:
     Examine me, LORD, and test me;
         test my heart and my mind.
     For your love is before my eyes,
         and your faithfulness governs my way.


     I never sat down with the worthless,
         nor companied with dissemblers.
     I hate the assembly of knaves,
         I would never sit down with the wicked;
     but, with hands washed in innocence,
         I would march round your altar, O LORD,
     singing loud songs of thanks,
         and telling of all your wonders.
     O LORD, I love your house,
         the place where your glory lives.


     Do not gather me up with sinners;
         slay me not with people of blood,
     whose hands are stained with villainy,
         and whose right hand is filled with bribes.
     But my walk is blameless!
         O redeem me, be gracious to me.
     My foot stands on even ground,
         in the choirs I will bless the LORD.

*Psalm 27 -- If God is for Me*
     A psalm of David.

     The LORD is my light and my saviour;
         whom then should I fear?
     The LORD protects my life;
         whom then should I dread?


     When the wicked drew near to assail me
         and eat up my flesh,
     it was those who distressed and opposed me
         who stumbled and fell.


     Though against me a host should encamp,
         yet my heart would be fearless:
     though battle should rise up against me,
         still would I be trustful.


     One thing have I asked of the LORD,
         and that do I long for --
     To live in the house of the LORD
         all the days of my life,
     to gaze on the grace of the LORD
         and inquire in his temple.


     For he will hide me in his shelter
         in the day of misfortune.
     In his sheltering tent he hides me:
         he lifts me up on a rock.


     And now that my head he has lifted
     above my encircling foes,
     I will march round the altar and sacrifice,
         shouting with joy, in his tent,
         making music and song to the LORD.

*The Serenity of Faith*


     Hear, O LORD, my loud cry,
         and graciously answer me.
     My heart has said to you,
         'Your face, O LORD, I seek.'


     Hide not your face from me,
         reject not your servant in anger:
         for you have been my help.
     Abandon me not, nor forsake me,
         O God of my help:
     for father and mother have left me;
         but the LORD will take me up.


     Teach me your way, O LORD:
         lead me in an even path,
         because of my enemies.
     Give me not up, O LORD,
         unto the rage of my foes;
     for against me have risen false witnesses,
         breathing out cruelty.


     Firm is the faith I cherish,
         that I, in the land of the living,
         will yet see the goodness of God.
     Let your heart be courageous and strong,
         and wait on the LORD.

*Psalm 28 -- An Answered Prayer for Help*
     Of David.

     Unto you, O LORD, do I cry;
         my rock, be not deaf to me:
     lest, through holding your peace, I become
         like those who go down to the pit.
     Hear my loud entreaty,
         as I cry for help to you,
     lifting my hands, O LORD,
         towards your holy chancel.


     Take me not off with the wicked,
         nor with the workers of wrong,
     whose speech to their neighbours is friendly,
         while evil is in their heart.
     Give them as they have done,
         as their wicked deeds deserve.
     As their hands have wrought, so give to them:
         requite to them their deserts.
     They are blind to all that the LORD does,
         to all that his hands have wrought;
     and so he will tear them down,
         to build them up no more.


     Blest be the LORD, who has heard
         my voice as I plead for mercy.
     The LORD is my strength and my shield;
         my heart trusts in him.
     I was helped: so my heart is exultant,
         and in my song I will praise him.


     The LORD is the strength of his people,
         the fortress who saves his anointed.
     O save your people,
         and bless your inheritance.
     Be their shepherd
         and carry them forever.

*Psalm 29 -- The Lord's Glory in the Storm*
     A psalm of David.

     Ascribe to the LORD, you heavenly beings,
         ascribe to the LORD glory and power
     Ascribe to the LORD the glory he manifests:
         bow to the LORD in holy array.


     The LORD's voice peals on the waters.
         The God of glory has thundered.
         He peals o'er the mighty waters.
     The LORD's voice sounds with strength,
         the LORD's voice sounds with majesty.


     The LORD's voice breaks the cedars,
         he breaks the cedars of Lebanon,
     making Lebanon dance like a calf,
         Sirion like a young wild ox.


     The LORD's voice hews out flames of fire.
     The LORD's voice rends the desert,
         he rends the desert of Kadesh.


     The LORD's voice whirls the oaks,
         and strips the forests bare;
         and all in his temple say 'Glory.'


     The LORD was king at the flood,
         the LORD sits throned forever.
     The LORD gives strength to his people,
         he blesses his people with peace.

*Psalm 30 -- A Song of Thanksgiving for Deliverance*
     A psalm of David. A song for the dedication of the Temple.

     I will extol you, O LORD,
         because you have lifted me up,
     and not suffered my foes to rejoice over me.


     I cried to you for help,
         O LORD my God, and you healed me.
     You have brought me up, LORD, from Sheol,
         from my way to the pit back to life you have called me.


     Sing praise to the LORD, faithful people;
         give thanks to his holy name.
     For his anger lasts only a moment,
         his favour endures for a lifetime.
     Weeping may lodge for the night,
         but the morning brings shouts of joy.


     When all went well, I imagined
         that never should I be shaken.
     For by your favour, O LORD,
         you had set me on mountains strong:
     but you hide your face,
         and I was confounded.


     Then to you, LORD, I cried,
         to the LORD I begged for mercy,
     'What profit is there in my blood,
         if I go down to the pit?
     Can you be praised by dust?
         Can it tell of your faithfulness?
     Hear, LORD, and show me your favour,
         LORD be a helper to me.'


     You have turned my mourning to dancing;
         my sackcloth you have unloosed,
         and clothed me with joy:
     that unceasingly I should sing your praise,
         and give thanks to you, LORD my God, forever.

*Psalm 31 -- A Prayer for Deliverance from Troubles*
     For the leader. A psalm of David.

     In you, O LORD, I take refuge;
         let me never be put to shame.
     Rescue me in your faithfulness;
         incline to me your ear.
     Deliver me speedily.
         Be to me a rock of defence,
     a fortified house, to save me.
         For my rock and my fortress are you;
     lead me and guide me so your name will be honoured.
         Draw me out of the net they have hid for me,
     for you yourself are my refuge.
         Into your hand I commend my spirit:
         you ransom me, LORD, faithful God.
     I hate those devoted to worthless idols;
         I trust in the LORD.
     I will rejoice and be glad in your love,
         because you have looked on my misery,
         and cared for me in my distress.
     You have not given me into the enemy's hand,
         you have set my feet in a spacious place.


     Be gracious to me, LORD, for I am distressed;
         my eye is wasted away with sorrow.
     For my life is consumed with grief,
         and my years with sighing.
     My strength is broken with misery,
         my bones waste away.
     The scorn of all my foes,
         the butt of my neighbours am I,
         a terror to my acquaintance.
     At the sight of me in the street
         people turn quickly away.
     I am clean forgotten like the dead,
         am become like a ruined vessel.
     I hear the whispers of many --
         terror on every side --
     scheming together against me,
         plotting to take my life.


     But my trust is in you, LORD.
         'You are my God,' I say;
     my times are in your hand, save me
         from the hand of the foes who pursue me.
     Make your face to shine on your servant,
         save me in your love.
     Put me not, O LORD, to shame,
         for I have called upon you.
     Let the wicked be put to shame
         silent in Sheol.
     Strike the false lips dumb,
         that speak proudly against the righteous
         with haughtiness and contempt.


     How great is the goodness
         you have treasured for those who fear you,
     and wrought for those who take refuge in you,
         in plain sight of all!
     In your sheltering wings you hide them
         from plottings of people,
     you keep them safe in a bower
         from the chiding of tongues.


     Blest be the LORD
         for the wonderful love he has shown me
         in time of distress.
     For I had said in panic,
         'I am driven clean out of your sight.'
     But you heard my plea,
         when I cried to you for help.


     Love the LORD, all you faithful;
         the LORD protects the loyal,
     but repays the haughty in full.
     Let your hearts be courageous and strong,
         all you who wait on the LORD.

*Psalm 32 -- A Prayer of Confession and Joy*
     Of David. A maskil.

     Happy those whose transgression is pardoned,
         whose sin is covered.
     Happy are those, free from falseness of spirit,
         to whom the LORD reckons no debt of guilt.


     When I held my peace, my bones wore away
         with my endless groaning;
     for day and night did your hand
         lie heavy upon me.
     The sap of my life was dried up
         as with fierce summer-heat. Selah


     I began to acknowledge my sin,
         not concealing my guilt;
     and the moment I vowed to confess
         to the LORD my transgression,
     then you yourself did pardon
         the guilt of my sin. Selah


     For this cause let all who are faithful
         pray to you in the time of distress;
     then, when the great waters rush,
         they will not reach to him.
     For you are my shelter,
         you protect me from trouble,
         and surround me with deliverance. Selah


     'With my eye steadfastly upon you,
         I will instruct and teach you
         The way you should go.
     Do not be like the horse or the mule,
         that have no understanding,
     but need bridle and halter to curb them,
         else they will not come near to you.'


     The godless have many sorrows,
         but those who trust in the LORD
         will be compassed about by his kindness.
     Be glad in the LORD, and rejoice, you righteous;
         and ring out your joy, all you upright in heart.

*Psalm 33 -- A Hymn of Thanksgiving*


     Shout for joy in the LORD, you righteous:
         praise for the upright is seemly.
     Give thanks to the LORD on the lyre,
         play to him on a ten-stringed harp.
     Sing to him a new song,
         play skilfully and shout merrily.
     For the LORD is straight in his promise;
         and all that he does is in faithfulness.
     Justice and right he loves;
         the earth is full of his kindness.


     By his word the heavens were made,
         all their host by the breath of his mouth.
     He gathers the sea in a bottle,
         the ocean he puts into store-houses.
     Let the whole world honour the LORD,
         let all who live on earth be in awe.
     For at his word it came into being,
         at his command it stood forth.


     The LORD frustrates the designs of the nations,
         what the peoples have purposed, he brings to nought,
     but the LORD's own design will stand forever,
         and what his heart has purposed, through all generations.
     Happy the nation whose God is the LORD,
         the people he chose for himself as his own.


     The LORD looks down from heaven,
         he sees all of humanity;
     from where he rules he gazes
         on all who inhabit the earth.
     He fashions the hearts of them all,
         and gives heed to all that they do.


     It is not by great armies that kings are victorious,
         it is not by great strength that a warrior saves himself;
     false hope is the war-horse to usher in victory,
         for all its great might it can provide no escape.


     See! The eye of the LORD is on those who fear him,
         on those who hope in his kindness;
     to deliver their life from death,
         and to keep them alive in famine.


     We wait for the LORD:
         he is our help and our shield.
     For in him our heart is glad,
         we trust in his holy name.


     Let your kindness, O LORD, be upon us,
         as is our hope in you.

*Psalm 34 -- The Lord is Mindful of His Own*
     Of David, when he feigned madness in the presence of Abimelech, who
drove him away, and he left.

     I will bless the LORD at all times,
         in my mouth will his praise be forever.
     In the LORD will my heart make her boast,
         the humble will hear and be glad.
     O magnify the LORD with me
         and let us extol his name together.
     I sought the LORD, and, in answer,
         he saved me from all my terrors.
     Look to him and you will be radiant,
         with faces unashamed.
     Here is one who was crushed,
         but cried and was heard by the LORD,
         and brought safe out of every trouble.
     The LORD's angel encamps
         about those who fear him, and rescues them.
     O taste and see that the LORD is good,
         happy those who take refuge in him.
     Fear the LORD, all his people,
         for they who fear him lack nothing.
     Even young lions may be poor and hungry,
         but those who seek the LORD
         will not lack any good thing.


     Come, children, listen to me.
         I will teach you the fear of the LORD.
     Which of you is desirous of life,
         loves many and happy days?
     Then guard your tongue from evil,
         and your lips from speaking deceit.
     Depart from evil, and do good;
         seek peace, and pursue it.
     The eyes of the LORD are towards the righteous,
         his ears are towards their cry for help.
     The LORD sets his face against those who do evil,
         to root their memory out of the earth.
     When righteous cry, they are heard by the LORD,
         and he saves them from all their distresses.
     The LORD is near to the broken-hearted,
         he helps those whose spirit is crushed.
     Many misfortunes befall the righteous,
         but the LORD delivers them out of them all.
     He guards all their bones,
         none are broken.
     Misfortune will slay the ungodly;
         those who hate the righteous are doomed.
     The LORD ransoms the life of his servants,
         and none will be doomed who takes refuge in him.

*Psalm 35 -- A Prayer for Deliverance from Malicious Foes*
     Of David.

     Contend, LORD, with those who contend with me,
         do battle with those who do battle with me.
     Grasp shield and buckler,
         and rise up as my help.
     Draw spear and battle-axe,
         confront those who pursue me.
         Assure me that you will help me.
     Dishonour and shame be on those
         who are seeking my life!
     Defeat and confusion on those
         who are planning my hurt!
     As chaff before wind may they be,
         with the LORD's angel pursuing them.
     Slippery and dark be their way,
         with his angel thrusting them on.
     For they wantonly hid their net for me,
         and dug a pit to destroy me.


     Upon them may ruin come unawares;
     may the net which they hid catch themselves,
         and into the pit may they fall.
     Then I will exult in the LORD,
         and be joyful because of his help;
     and all my being will say,
         'Who, O LORD, is like you,
     who save the helpless from those too strong for them,
         the poor and the helpless from those who despoil them?'


     Violent witnesses rise,
         and ask of me things that I know not.
     Evil for good they requite me,
         leaving me inwardly comfortless.


     But when they were sick, I put on sackcloth,
         and chastened myself with fasting.
     I prayed with head bowed low,
         as if for my friend or my brother.
     I went about bowed and in mourning,
         as one who laments his mother.


     When I stumbled, they gleefully gathered,
         strangers gathered around me,
         and tore at me without ceasing,
     impiously mocking and mocking,
         bearing their teeth at me.


     How long, LORD, will you look on?
         Rescue me from their roaring,
         my precious life from the lions.
     I will then give you thanks in the great congregation,
         and praise you before many people.
     Suffer not those to rejoice over me
         who are falsely my foes,
     suffer not those who without cause abhor me
         to wink with the eye.


     For it is not peace that they speak
         of those who are quiet in the land;
     but treacherous charges they plot.
         With wide open mouths they shout,
     'Hurrah! Hurrah!
         With our own eyes we saw it.'


     But you have seen, too, O LORD,
         keep not silence, O LORD,
         be not far from me.
     Bestir you, awake, for my right
         my God, my LORD, for my cause.


     You are just, LORD: win for me justice,
         let them not rejoice over me,
     inwardly saying, 'Hurrah!
         The desire of our hearts at last!
         Now we have swallowed him up.'
     Shame and confusion together
         on those who rejoice at my hurt!
     Clothed with shame and dishonour
         be those who are haughty to me!


     Let such as delight in my cause
     ring out their gladness,
         and say evermore,
     'Great is the LORD whose delight
         is the well-being of his servant.'
     Then my tongue will tell of your justice,
         and all the day long of your praise.

*Psalm 36 -- The Triumphant Power of God's Love*
     For the leader. Of the servant of the LORD, of David.

     Sin whispers within the heart of the wicked,
         who have no dread of God before their eyes.
     It flatters them in their eyes
         that their sin will not be found out.


     First, their speech becomes wicked and false,
         they give up acting wisely and well.
     Then they plot deliberate wrong,
         take their stand on the wicked way,
         without the least shrinking from evil.


     Your love, O LORD, touches the heavens,
         your faithfulness reaches the clouds.
     Your justice is like the great mountains,
         your judgments are like the broad sea.
         LORD, you save people and animals.
     How precious your love, O God!
         All may seek shelter in the shadow of your wings.
     They feast on the fat of your house,
         they drink of your brook of delights.
     For with you is the fountain of life,
         in the light that is yours we see light.


     O continue your grace to the faithful,
         your love to the upright in heart.
     Let no arrogant foot tread upon me,
         no wicked hand drive me to exile.


     There the workers of wrong lie prostrate,
         thrust down to rise up no more.

*Psalm 37 -- Trust in the Lord and Do Good*
     Of David.

     Be not kindled to wrath at the wicked,
         nor envious of those who work wrong;
     for, like grass, they will speedily wither,
         and fade like the green of young grass.


     Trust in the LORD, and do good;
         remain in the land, and deal faithfully:
     then the LORD will be your delight,
         he will grant you your heart's petitions.


     Commit your way to the LORD;
         trust in him, and he will act,
     making clear as the light your right,
         and your just cause clear as the noon-day.


     In silence and patience wait on the LORD.
         Be not kindled to anger at those who prosper.
         At those who execute evil devices.


     Desist from anger, abandon wrath:
         be not kindled to anger it leads but to evil:
     for evildoers will be cut off,
         but the land will be theirs, who wait on the LORD.


     Yet but a little, and the wicked vanish:
         look at their place: they are there no more.
     But the humble will have the land,
         and the rapture of peace in abundance.


     The wicked plots against the righteous,
          snarls like a wild animal;
     the LORD laughs,
         for he sees that his day is coming.


     The wicked have drawn the sword, and bent the bow,
         to fell the poor, to slay those who walk uprightly;
     but their sword will pierce their own heart,
         and their bows will be broken in pieces.


     Better is the righteous person's little
         than the wealth of many wicked.
     For the arms of the wicked will be broken,
         but the LORD upholds the righteous.


     The LORD watches over the days of the blameless,
         their heritage will continue forever.
     They will not be shamed in the evil time,
         in the days of famine they will be satisfied.


     Because the wicked will perish:
     but the foes of the LORD, like a brand in the oven,
         will vanish, like smoke they will vanish.


     The wicked must borrow and cannot pay back,
         but the righteous is lavish and gives.
     For those blest by the LORD inherit the land,
         while those whom he curses will be cut off.


     The LORD supports the steps
         of those with whom he is pleased.
     Though they fall, they will not be cast headlong,
         for the LORD holds their hands.


     Never, from youth to age,
         have I seen the righteous forsaken,
         or their children begging bread.
     They are ever lavishly lending,
         and their children are fountains of blessing.


     Turn away from evil and do good
         and you will live in the land forever.
     For the LORD loves justice,
         he does not forsake his friends.


     The unrighteous will be destroyed forever,
         and the seed of the wicked will be cut off.
     But the land will belong to the righteous,
         they will live upon it forever,


     The mouth of the righteous murmurs wisdom,
         and words of justice are on their tongues.
     The law of their God is in their heart,
         their steps are never unsteady.


     The wicked watches the righteous,
         and seeks to put them to death.
     But the LORD leaves them not in their hand:
         at their trial they will not be held guilty.


     Wait on the LORD, and observe his way:
         he will lift you to honour the land will be yours,
         you will feast your eyes on the doom of the wicked.


     I have seen the wicked exultant,
         lifting themselves like a cedar of Lebanon.
     But the moment I passed, they vanished!
         I sought for them, but they could not be found.


     Preserve your honour and practise uprightness,
         for such a person fares well in the end.
     But transgressors will perish together.
         Cut off are the wicked forever.


     The righteous are saved by the LORD,
         who in time of distress is their refuge:
     the LORD helps and rescue them,
         from the wicked he rescues and saves them,
         because they take refuge in him.

*Psalm 38 -- A Confession and Prayer for Deliverance*
     A Psalm of David. A lament.

     Reprove me not, LORD, in your anger,
         and chasten me not in your wrath;
     for your arrows have sunk into me,
         and your hand lies heavy upon me.


     In my flesh is no soundness
         because of your anger,
     no health in my bones,
         because of my sin.
     For that my guilt
         is gone over my head:
     it weighs like a burden
         too heavy for me.


     My wounds stink and fester,
         for my foolishness I am tormented.
     Bent and bowed am I utterly,
         all the day going in mourning.


     My loins are filled with burning,
         and in my flesh is no soundness.
     I am utterly crushed and numb;
         I cry louder than lion roars.


     LORD, you know all that I long for,
         my groans are not hidden from you.
     My heart is throbbing,
         my strength has failed me.
     The light of my eyes --
         even it is gone from me.


     My dear ones and friends keep aloof,
         and my neighbours stand afar off.
     They who aim at my life lay their snares,
         they who seek my hurt speak of ruin,
         nursing treachery all the day long.


     But I turn a deaf ear and hear not;
         like the dumb I open not my mouth.
     I am like one without hearing,
         with no arguments in my mouth.


     For my hope, O LORD, is in you.
         You will answer, O LORD my God,
     when I utter the hope that those
         who made scorn of my tottering feet
         may not rejoice over me.


     For I am ready to fall,
         my pain forsakes me never.
     I acknowledge my guilt,
         I am anxious because of my sin:


     My wanton assailants are strong,
         those who wrongfully hate me are many,
     who render me evil for good,
         and oppose me, because I make good my goal.


     Do not forsake me, O LORD;
         my God, be not far from me.
     Hasten to help me,
         O LORD my saviour.

*Psalm 39 -- The Pathos of Life*
     For the leader; for Jeduthun. A psalm of David.

     I vowed to watch my words,
         and sin not with my tongue,
     but to put on my mouth a muzzle,
         while the wicked were in my presence.
     I was silent and dumb,
         speechless:
         but my pain was stirred up.
     My heart grew hot within me;
         as I mused, the fire was kindled,
         till at last the words came to my tongue.


     'Teach me, O LORD, my end,
         and the sum of my days what it is.
         Let me know how transient I am.
     See! My days you have made but a span,
         and my life is as nothing before you.
     It is but as a breath that everyone stands: Selah
         it is but in mere semblance we walk to and fro,
     and all our noise is for nothing.
         We heap up, and know not who will gather.'


     And now, what wait I for, LORD?
         My hope is in you.
     From all my transgressions deliver me;
         make me not the scorn of the fool.
     I am dumb, never opening my mouth,
         for this is your own doing.
     Remove your stroke from off me:
         by the might of your hand I am spent.
     When you rebuke someone to punish their sins,
         you consume, like a moth, what they treasures.
         Everyone is only a breath. Selah


     Hear my prayer, O LORD;
         attend to my cry for help.
         Hold not your peace at my tears.
     For I am but a guest of yours,
         a stranger visiting, like all my ancestors.
     Look away from me, let me smile again,
         before I die and am gone.

*Psalm 40 -- Thanksgiving and Petition*
     For the leader. A psalm of David.

     For the LORD I waited and waited,
         till, inclining to me,
         he heard my cry.
     From the horrible pit he drew me,
         up out of the miry clay;
     he set my feet on a rock,
         and my steps he made firm.
     He put a new song in my mouth,
         of praise to our God.
     Many see it, and, filled with awe,
         put their trust in the LORD.


     Happy the person who has put
         in the LORD their trust,
     not looking to false gods
         or turning to idols.
     With us you have wrought in rich measure,
         O LORD our God,
     your marvels and purposes for us --
         none may compare with you --
     were I to declare or to tell them,
         past counting are they.


     In offerings bloody or bloodless
         you have no delight,
     but with open ears you have made me.
     Burnt-offering and offering for sin
         are not what you ask.
     Then said I, 'Here I am,
         as the roll of the book has enjoined.
     My delight, O God, is to do your will,
         and your law is within my heart.'
     Well, O LORD, you know
         that, with lips unrestrained,
     your righteousness I told
         in the great congregation,
     not hiding it in my heart.
         I have told of your steadfast help,
     from the great congregation I hid not
         your love and your faithfulness.
     So do not restrain, LORD,
         your pity from us.
     Your love and your faithfulness -- ever
         may they be our shield.


     For evils that cannot be numbered
         have compassed me round.
     My transgressions have followed me up --
         I can bear it no more.
     They are more than the hairs of my head,
         and my heart has forsaken me.
     O LORD, be pleased to deliver me,
         haste to my help, O LORD.
     May those who are seeking my life
         be ashamed and confounded together;
     may those who delight in my hurt
         be defeated and brought to dishonour.
     May those who hurrah over me
         be dumbfounded because of their shame.
     But may all who seek after you
         rejoice and be glad in you.
     May all those eager for your aid,
         say, 'Great is the LORD' evermore.
     I am weak and needy,
         yet the LORD cares for me.
     You are my help and deliverer;
         don't delay, my God.

*Psalm 41 -- A Prayer for Healing and Vindication*
     For the leader; for Jeduthun. A psalm of David.

     Happy are those who consider the weak;
         in the day of misfortune the LORD will deliver them.
     He will keep them safe, happy, and long in the land,
         and not give them up to the rage of their foes.
     The LORD will sustain them on bed of languishing;
         tending their sickness, as long as they lie.


     For this cause I say, 'LORD, show me your favour;
         heal me, because I have sinned against you.'
     My enemies speak of me nothing but evil,
         'When will he die, and his name pass away?'
     When one comes to see me, their words ring hollow;
         their heart keeps gathering mischief the while;
         and when they go out, they give it speech.
     In secret they whisper together against me,
         all those who hate me plot evil against me.
     'Some fatal disease has fastened upon him;
         and now that he lies, he will rise up no more.'
     My most trusted friend, on whom I relied,
         who ate of my bread, has turned against me.


     But do you, LORD, graciously raise me up,
         that I may pay them their due reward.
     By this will I know you delight in me:
         if my foes may not shout over me in triumph.
     For my innocence you uphold me,
         and set me forever before your face.




             Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel,
             from everlasting to everlasting,
             Amen and Amen.

                               [Book Two]



*Psalm 42 -- Yearning for God*
     For the leader. A maskil of the Korahites.

     Like the hart which longs
         for brooks of water,
     I long
         for you, God.


     I thirst for God,
         for my living God.
     When shall I enter in,
         and see the face of God?
     My tears have been my food
         by day and by night;
     for they say to me all the day long,
         'Where is your God?'


     My heart floods with sorrow,
         as I call to mind:
     how I used to pass on with the throng,
         at their head, to the house of God,
     with glad shouts and giving of thanks,
         in the throng who kept festival.


     Why am I downcast?
         Why this moaning within me?
     Hope in God;
         for yet will I praise him,
         my help, my God.


     I am sunk in my misery;
         I will therefore call you to mind
     from the land of Jordan and Hermon,
         the mountain Mizar.
     Flood is calling to flood
         at the noise of your cataracts;
     all your waves and your breakers
         have passed over me.


     In the day I cry to the LORD
         to summon his kindness;
     and the song that I sing in the night
         is a prayer to the living God.
     I say to God my rock,
         'Why have you forgotten me?
     Why must I walk so sadly,
         so hard pressed by the foe?'
     It pierces me to the heart
         to hear the enemy's taunts,
     as all the day long they say to me,
         'Where is your God?'


     Why am I downcast?
         Why this moaning within me?
     Hope in God;
         for yet will I praise him,
         my help, my God.

*Psalm 43 -- Plea for Help*


     Right me, defend my cause
         against a pitiless people.
     From the crafty and crooked,
         O God, deliver me.
     For you are God my protector:
         why have you cast me off?
     Why must I walk so sadly,
         so hard pressed by the foe?
     Send forth your light and your truth,
         let them be my guides:
     to your holy hill let them bring me,
         to the place where you live.
     Then will I go to God's altar,
         to God my rejoicing;
     and with joy on the lyre I will praise you,
         O God, my God.


     Why am I downcast?
         Why this moaning within me?
     Hope in God;
         for yet will I praise him,
         my help, my God.

*Psalm 44 -- A Lament in Defeat*
     For the leader. Of the Korahites. A maskil.

     O God, we have heard with our ears,
         all our ancestors have told us
     of the work that you wrought in their day,
         your wonders in days of old,
     uprooting and crushing the nations,
         then planting and settling them.
     For it wasn't their own sword that won them the land,
         it was not their own arm that brought them the victory.
     Yours was the hand and the arm,
         yours was the face that shone on them with favour.
     It was you, my king and my God,
         that ordained the victories of Jacob.


     Through you we can thrust back our foes,
         and by your name tread down our assailants:
     for not in my bow do I trust,
         nor can my sword win me the victory.
     Our victory comes from you,
         and confusion to those who hate us.
     In God we boast all the day long,
         and your name will we praise forever. Selah


     Yet you have spurned and disgraced us,
         in not going forth with our armies,
     and in making us flee from the foe,
         so that those who hated us plundered us.
     You have let us be eaten like sheep,
         you have scattered us over the world,
     sold your people for a pittance,
         and getting no gain from their price.
     You have made us the butt of our neighbours,
         the derision and scorn of all round us.
     O'er the world you have made us a byword,
         the nations at us shake their heads.
     My disgrace is forever before me,
         my face is covered with shame,
     at the words of blasphemer and scoffer,
         at the sight of the foe and the vengeful.


     All this has come upon us,
         yet we have not forgotten you
         nor falsely dealt with your covenant.
     Our heart has not turned back,
         nor our steps declined from your way,
     that you thus should have crushed us down,
         and covered us over with gloom,
         in the place where the jackals roam.
     Had we forgotten the name of our God,
         or stretched out our hands to a god that was strange,
     would God not have searched this out?
         For he knows the heart and its secrets.
     But in your cause it is we are killed all the day,
         and counted as sheep for the slaughter.


     Rouse yourself, why do you sleep Lord?
         Awake, cast us not off forever.
     Why do you hide your face,
         forgetting our stress and our misery?
     For we have sunk down to the dust,
         our bodies cling to the ground.
     Arise, come to our help:
         for your love's sake, ransom us.

*Psalm 45 -- Song for the Marriage of a King*
     For the leader; on shoshannim. Of the Korahites. A maskil. A love
song.

     My heart is astir with beautiful words:
         I will sing a song, concerning the king,
     with tongue like the pen of a ready writer.


         Your beauty is more than mortal,
         grace is shed over your lips:
     therefore God has blessed you forever.
         Warrior, strap your sword on your thigh.
     What glory and splendour!


         Good fortune attend you, as forth you ride
     in the cause of good faith, and as champion of justice.
         May your arm instruct you in deeds of dread.
     Sharp are your arrows; nations fall under you:
         pierced to the heart are the foes of the king.


     Your throne shall endure for ever and ever
         your royal sceptre a sceptre of equity.
     Right you love and wrong you hate:
         therefore the LORD your God anoints you
         With oil of gladness above your fellows.


     With myrrh, aloes, and cassia your robes are all fragrant,
         you are gladdened by music of ivory harps.
     King's daughters stand ready with jewels for you,
         at your right hand the queen in gold of Ophir.


     Listen, daughter, and see; and incline your ear:
         forget your folk and your father's house.
     And when the king desires your beauty,
         bow to him, for he is your lord.
     So shall the Tyrians come with gifts,
         and the richest of people will do you homage.


     The king's daughter is glorious altogether,
         with dress of pearls inwrought with gold.
     In many-coloured robes she is led to the king,
         with the virgin companions she brought in her train.
         The king's palace they enter with joy and rejoicing.


     May sons of yours take the place of your fathers,
         whom you will make princes in all the land.
     Your name will I celebrate world without end,
         so that nations shall praise you for ever and ever.

*Psalm 46 -- Our God is a Mighty Fortress*
     For the leader. Of the Korahites, on alamoth. A song.

     God is our refuge and strength,
         a very present help in trouble.
     So we have no fear, though earth should change,
         and the hills totter into the heart of the ocean.
     Let its waters roar and foam,
         let the mountains shake with the swelling thereof.
     On our side is the LORD of hosts,
         our sure defence is the God of Jacob. Selah


     A river there is, whose streams make glad
         God's city, the home the Most High has hallowed.
     God is within her: she cannot be shaken.
         God helps her at the turn of the morning.
     Nations roared, kingdoms tottered:
         he uttered his voice, earth melted away.
     On our side is the LORD of hosts,
         our sure defence is the God of Jacob.


     Come and see what the LORD has done,
         working appallingly in the earth.
     He stills wars to the ends of the earth --
         breaking the bow, snapping the spear,
         burning the chariots in the fire.
     'Refrain; and know surely that I am God,
         high over the nations, high over the world.'
     On our side is the LORD of Hosts,
         our sure defence is the God of Jacob. Selah

*Psalm 47 -- The Lord's Universal Sovereignty*
     For the leader. Of the Korahites. A psalm.

     Clap your hands, all you peoples:
         shout to God in ringing cries.
     For the LORD is most high and dread,
         a great king over all the earth.


     He subdues the peoples under us,
         the nations under our feet;
     he chooses our heritage for us,
         the glory of Jacob whom he loves. Selah


     God is gone up with a shout,
         the LORD with the sound of a trumpet.
     Sing praise to our God, sing praises:
         sing praise to our king, sing praises.


     For king of all earth is he:
         praise God in a skilful song.
     God is king over all the nations,
         God sits on his holy throne.


     Princes of nations gather
         with the people of Abraham's God:
     for the shields of the earth are God's;
         greatly exalted is he.

*Psalm 48 -- The Marvellous Deliverance of Zion*
     A song. A psalm of the Korahites.

     Great is the LORD and worthy all praise
         in the city of our God.
     His holy mountain, that rises so fair,
         is the joy of all the world.
     Like the mount of the gods is Mount Zion,
         the city of the great king.


     Once God made himself known
         as the defence of her palaces.
     For see! A concert of kings
         passed over the frontier together.
     But one glance, and they were astounded;
         they hastened away in dismay.
     Trembling took hold of them there,
         like the pains of a woman in labour.
     They were shattered, as east wind shatters
         the giant ships in pieces.
     What we heard, we now have seen
         in the city of the LORD of hosts,
     the city of our God.
         God will uphold her forever. Selah


     We think, O God, of your love,
         in the midst of your temple.
     Your fame, O God, like your name, shall extend
         to the ends of the earth.
     Victory fills your hand.
         Let mount Zion be glad;
     let the daughters of Judah rejoice
         because of your judgments.
     Walk about Zion, go round her;
         count her towers.
     Set your mind on her ramparts,
         consider her palaces;
     that you tell to the next generation
         That such is God,
     our God he it is who shall guide us
         for ever and ever.

*Psalm 49 -- The Problem of the Prosperity of the Wicked*
     For the leader. Of the Korahites. A psalm.

     Hear this, you peoples all;
         attend, all you who live in the world
     people of low degree and high,
         the rich and the poor together.
     My mouth shall utter wisdom,
         the thoughts of a seeing heart.
     I incline my ear to a proverb,
         on the lyre I will open my riddle.


     Why should I be afraid in the days of misfortune,
         when circled by wicked and cunning foes,
     who put their trust in their wealth,
         and boast of their boundless riches?


     For assuredly no one can ransom themselves,
         or give to God the price of their life,
     for the ransom of a life is costly,
         no payment is ever enough,
     to keep them alive for ever and ever,
         so as never to see the pit at all.


     But see it they will. Even wise people die,
         the fool and the brutish perish alike,
         and abandon their wealth to others.
     The grave is their everlasting home,
         the place they shall live in for ever and ever,
         though after their own names they called whole lands.
     Despite their wealth,
         they perish like dumb animals.


     This is the fate of the confident fool,
         and the end of those who are pleased with their portion. Selah
     Like sheep they descend to Sheol
         with Death for their shepherd;
     down they go straight to the grave,
         and their form wastes away in their home below.


     But God will assuredly ransom my life
         from the hand of Sheol;
         for he will receive me. Selah
     So be not afraid when someone grows rich,
         when the wealth of their house increases.
     Not a shred of it all can they take when they die,
         wealth cannot follow them down.
     Though they count themselves happy, when they are alive,
         and win praise from many for faring so well,
     they must join their ancestors,
         who see the light nevermore.
     The wealthy are without understanding,
         they perish like dumb animals.

*Psalm 50 -- True Worship*
     A psalm of Asaph.

     The LORD God has spoken: He summons the earth
         from sunrise to sunset.
     From Zion, perfection of beauty,
         God's glory shines forth.
     Our God comes, he cannot keep silence,
     devouring fire is before him,
         and furious tempest around him.
     He summons the heavens above
         and the earth to judge his people.
     Gather to him his saints
         by covenant-sacrifice bound to him;
     that the heavens may declare his justice,
         for a God of justice is he. Selah


     'Hear, O my people, and I will speak,
         and protest to you, O Israel:
         I am the LORD, your God.
     Not for your sacrifices will I reprove you
         your burnt-offerings are ever before me
     Not a bullock will I take from your house,
         nor male goats out of your folds;
     for all beasts of the forest are mine,
         and the kine on a thousand hills.
     I know all the birds of the air,
         all that moves on the fields is mine.
     Were I hungry, I would not tell you,
         for the world and its fulness are mine.
     Am I such as to eat bulls' flesh,
         or drink the blood of goats?
     Offer to God a thank-offering,
         pay the Most High your vows.
     Summon me in the day of distress,
         I will rescue you, so will you honour me.'


     But to the wicked God says:
         'What right have you to talk of my statutes,
         or take my covenant into your mouth
     while you yourself hate correction,
         and cast my words behind you?
     When you see a thief, you run with them;
         with adulterers you keep company.
     You let your mouth loose for evil,
         your tongue contrives deceit.
     You shamefully speak of your kin,
         and slander your own mother's son.
     And because I kept silence at this,
         you did take me for one like yourself.
         But I will convict you and show you plainly.


     'Now you who forget God, mark this,
         lest I rend you, past hope of deliverance.
     Those who bring a thank-offering honour me;
         but to those: who follows my way,
         I will show the salvation of God.'

*Psalm 51 -- God be Merciful to Me, the Sinner*
     For the leader. A psalm of David, when Nathan the prophet come to
him after he had been with Bathsheba.

     In your kindness, O God, be gracious to me,
         in your own great pity blot out my transgressions.
     Wash me clean of my guilt,
         make me pure of my sin.


     For well I know my transgressions,
         my sin is ever before me.
     Against you, only you, have I sinned,
         and done that which is wrong in your sight:
     you therefore are just when you speak,
         and clear when you utter judgment.
     See! In guilt was I brought to the birth,
         and in sin did my mother conceive me.
     It's the innermost truth you desire,
         give me therefore true wisdom of heart.


     Purge me clean with hyssop,
         wash me whiter than snow.
     Fill me with joy and gladness,
         let the bones you have broken rejoice.
     Hide your face from my sins,
         and blot out my guilt altogether.


     Create me a clean heart, O God,
         put a new steadfast spirit within me.
     Cast me not forth from your presence,
         withdraw not your holy spirit.
     Give me back the joy of your help,
         with a willing spirit sustain me.


     I will teach your ways to transgressors,
         and sinners shall turn to you.
     Save me from blood, O God,
         and my tongue shall ring out your faithfulness.
     Open my lips, O LORD,
         and my mouth shall declare your praise.


     For in sacrifice you have no pleasure,
         in gifts of burnt-offering no delight.
     The sacrifice pleasing to God
         is a spirit that is broken;
     a heart that is crushed, O God,
         you will not despise.


     Do good in your pleasure to Zion,
         build the walls of Jerusalem.
     Then will you welcome the due forms of sacrifice,
         then on your altars shall bullocks be offered.

*Psalm 52 -- The Doom of Arrogance*
     For the leader. A maskil of David, when Doeg the Edomite came and
told Saul that David had gone to Abimelech's house.

     Why glory in mischief, you hero?
         God's kindness is all the day.
     Engulfing ruin you plot,
         your tongue like a razor sharpened,
         you practiser of deceit.
     Evil, not good, you love,
         and falsehood, not words of truth. Selah
     But you love all words that devour,
         and a tongue that is given to deceit.


     But God, on his part, shall destroy you forever,
         grasp you and pluck you out of your tent,
         and root you out of the land of the living. Selah
     Smitten with awe at the sight,
         the righteous shall laugh at you.
     'Look' (they will say) 'at the hero
         who did not make God his stronghold,
     but trusted in his great wealth
         and in the strength of his riches.'


     But I am like a fresh olive-tree
         in the house of God.
     I trust in the kindness of God
         for ever and evermore.
     I will render you thanks for ever
         for what you have done.
     I will tell how good you are
         in the presence of those who love you.

*Psalm 53 -- The Folly of Denying God*
     For the leader. On mahalath. A maskil of David.

     Fools say in their heart,
         'There is no God.'
     Vile, hateful their life is;
         not one does good.


     From heaven God looks out
         on humans, to see
     if any are wise,
         and care for God.


     But all have turned bad,
         the taint is on all;
     not one does good,
         no, not one.


     Have they learned their lesson,
         those workers of evil?
     Who ate up my people,
         eating, devouring,
         never calling to the LORD.


     Sore afraid will they be,
         where no fear was;
     when God scatters the bones
         of the godless people.
     They will be put to shame,
         when God rejects them.


     If only help from Zion
         would come for Israel!
     When God brings his people
         a change of fortune,
     how glad will be Jacob,
         and Israel how joyful!

*Psalm 54 -- A Prayer for Deliverance from Oppression*
     For the leader. With stringed instruments. A maskil of David, when
the Ziphites came and said to Saul, "David is in hiding among us".

     Save me, O God, by your name,
         by your power secure for me justice.
     Listen, O God, to my prayer,
         attend to the words of my mouth.
     For proud men have risen against me,
         and terrible men seek my life,
         men who do not set God before them. Selah


     But see! God is my helper,
         the LORD is sustaining my life.
     Let their evil fall back on my foes:
         cut them off in your faithfulness, LORD.


     Then will I bring you glad sacrifice,
         praising your gracious name;
     for from all distress you have saved me,
         and feasted my eyes on my foes.

*Psalm 55 -- Betrayed by a Friend*
     For the leader. With stringed instruments. A maskil of David.

     Listen, God, to my prayer.
         Don't hide yourself from my pleading.
     Hear me, and answer;
         for bitter is my lament.
     I am wild with the noise of the foe,
         with the clamour of the ungodly;
     for they hurl disaster upon me,
         and attack me with fury.
     My heart shudders within me,
         terrors of deaths press on me,
     fear and trembling attack me,
         and horror wraps me round.
     O for the wings of a dove:
         I would fly away and rest.
     I would wander far away,
         find refuge in the wilderness. Selah
     I would find myself a shelter
         from raging wind and tempest.


     Confuse them, LORD, upset their plans;
         for I see violence and strife in the city.
     By day and by night they make their rounds
         on the city walls,
     while within is crime and trouble,
         within is ruin.
     Her market-place is never free
         of deceit and tyranny.

*The Treacherous Friend*


     The taunts were not those of a foe
         that I could have borne;
     the disdain was not that of an enemy
         I could have shunned them:
     but it was you, my equal,
         my dear and familiar friend.
     We used to be so close,
         together we walked in God's house with the crowd.
     May death suddenly take them,
         may they go down to Sheol alive,
         for evil lives in their homes and their hearts.


     But I will call on God,
         the LORD will save me.
     Evening and morning and noon
         I lament and moan.
     He will hear my voice;
         though I am attacked by many
     he will rescue me,
         unharmed from the war.
     God, who sits on his ancient throne
         will hear and will humble them,
     for they never change,
         they never fear God. Selah


     My friend turned against me,
         betrayed his word.
     His mouth was smoother than butter,
         but war filled his heart.
     His words were softer than oil,
         but sharper than swords.
     Cast your burden on the LORD,
         and he will sustain you.
     He will never let the righteous
         be shaken.
     But you, God, will hurl them down
         to the deepest pit.
     Bloody and treacherous people
         will not live out half their days;
         but I will trust you.

*Psalm 56 -- A Prayer of Trust in God*
     For the leader. On jonath elem rehokim. Of David. A michtam, when
the Philistines seized him in Gath.

     O God, be gracious to me,
         for people trample upon me,
         all the day righting and pressing me.
     All the day enemies trample me;
         many there be
         who contend with me bitterly.
     In the day of my terror
         I trust in you.
     In God I maintain my cause,
         in God I fearlessly trust.
         What can flesh do to me?


     They torture me all the day,
         they ceaselessly plan to hurt me,
     banded together in secret,
         watching my every step,
         as those who hope for my death.
     Pay them out for their sin, O God,
         hurl down the strong in your anger.
     You yourself count my wanderings.
         Put in your bottle my tears
         are they not in your book?
     Then shall my foes be turned back
         in the day that I call.
     Of this I am sure,
         because God is for me.
     In God I maintain my cause,
         in the LORD I maintain my cause.
     In God I fearlessly trust,
         what can people do to me?


     Your vows are upon me, O God,
         I will render thank-offerings to you;
     because you have saved me from death,
         my feet from stumbling,
     to the end that I walk before God
         in the light of the living.

*Psalm 57 -- A Prayer for Protection from Persecution*
     For the leader. Al tashheth. A michtam of David, when he fled from
Saul into a cave.

     Be gracious, O God, be gracious to me,
         for in you I take shelter.
     In your sheltering wings I take refuge,
         till ruin be over past.
     I cry to the Most High God,
         to the God who accomplishes for me.
     He will send me his succour from heaven,
         he will thrust away those who would trample me. Selah
     In the midst of lions I lie,
         who devour human prey.
     Their teeth are spears and arrows,
         and their tongue is a sharpened sword.
     Be exalted, God, o'er the heavens,
         and your glory o'er all the earth.


     They set a net for my feet,
         but in it was their own foot caught.
     Before me they dug a pit,
         but they fell into it themselves. Selah


     My heart is steadfast, O God,
         my heart is steadfast.
     I would sing, I would make music;
         awake, my soul.
     Awake, harp and lyre;
         I would wake the dawn.
     I would praise you among the peoples, O LORD,
         and make music among the nations to you;
     for great to heaven is your love,
         and your faithfulness to the clouds.
     Be exalted, God, o'er the heavens,
         and your glory o'er all the earth.

*Psalm 58 -- A Prayer for Vengeance on Unjust Judges*
     For the leader. Al tashheth. Of David. A michtam.

     Do you speak what is right, you gods?
         With equity judge you your people?
     In the land you practise iniquity -- all of you;
         violence do you dispense with your hands.
     The wicked go astray from the womb
         liars take the wrong path from their birth.
     Venom have they like the venom of snakes,
         they are like the deaf adder that stops her ears,
     and refuses to listen to the voice of the charmer,
         or binder of spells, no matter how cunning.


     O God, break to pieces the teeth in their mouth,
         tear out the great teeth of the young lions, LORD.
     May they melt away like running water!
         Like tender grass, cut down may they be!
     Like the snail that dissolves on its crawling path,
         like the birth untimely which sees not the sunlight.
     Faster than a thorn-fire heats your pots,
         he will come with his tempest and sweep them away.
     The sight of such vengeance will gladden the righteous;
         their feet they will wash in the blood of the wicked.
     People will say, 'Yes, the just are rewarded:
         yes, on the earth is a God who is Judge.'

*Psalm 59 -- A Prayer for Safety*
     For the leader. Al tashheth. Of David. A michtam, when Saul sent
men to watch his house in order to kill him.

     Save me, O God, from my enemies;
         secure me from my assailants.
     Save me from those who do wrong,
         save me from the bloodthirsty.
     For see! They lay ambush for me,
         strong men are banded against me
     not for sin or transgression of mine,
         for no guilt of mine, O LORD,
     they run and make ready. Awake!
         Come forth to meet me, and see!
     You, O LORD of hosts,
         God of Israel, awake!
     And punish the proud, every one;
         spare none of the traitors vile. Selah


             At evening they come,
             and, howling like dogs,
             make their round in the city.
     Look at their venomous mouths,
         tongues like swords,
     they think no one
         hears them.
     But you, LORD, laugh at them,
         you mock all the insolent.
     My strength, I will sing to you,
         for God is my sure retreat.
     My God with his love will meet me,
         and feast my eyes on my foes.


     Slay them not, lest my people forget,
         let your hosts keep them roaming and wandering.
     In their sinful speech snare them, O LORD;
         and may they be trapped in their pride,
     for the curses and lies that they utter.
         In your wrath make a clean end of them,
     that people, to the ends of the earth,
         may know that God rules in Jacob. Selah


             At evening they come,
             and, howling like dogs,
             make their round in the city.
     They roam about for a feast,
         and snarl, if they get not their fill.
     But I will sing of your might;
         I will ring out your love in the morning.
     For to me you have been a sure refuge,
         a retreat in the day of my trouble.
     My strength, I will sing praise to you,
         for God is my sure retreat,
         my faithful God.

*Psalm 60 -- A Prayer after Defeat in Battle*
     For the leader. On shushan eduth. A michtam of David (for
teaching), when he fought with Aram-naharaim and Aram-zobah, and Joab
returned and defeated twelve thousand Edomites in the Valley of Salt.

     O God, you have spurned and broken us,
         routing us in your wrath -- restore us!
     You have shaken the land and cleft it;
         heal its tottering breaches.
     You have made your people drink hardship,
         and given us wine of reeling.


     You have given those who fear you a banner,
         a rallying-place from the bow, Selah
     for the rescue of your beloved.
         Save by your right hand and answer us.


     God did solemnly swear:
         'As victor will I divide Shechem,
         and mete out the valley of Succoth.
     Mine is Gilead, mine is Manasseh,
         Ephraim is the defence of my head,
         Judah my sceptre of rule,
     Moab the pot that I wash in,
         Edom -- I cast my shoe over it,
         I shout o'er Philistia in triumph.'


     O to be brought to the fortified city!
         O to be led into Edom!
     Have you not spurned us, O God?
         You do not march forth with our armies.
     Grant us help from the foe,
         for human help is worthless.
     With God we shall yet do bravely:
         he himself will tread down our foes.

*Psalm 61 -- Our God is a Strong Tower*
     For the leader. On stringed instruments. Of David.

     Hear my cry, O God,
         be attentive to my prayer.
     From the ends of the earth I call
         unto you, when my heart is faint:
     lead me to the rock
         that is high above me.
     For you are a refuge to me,
         a strong tower in face of the foe.


     O to be guest in your tent forever,
         hiding beneath your sheltering wings! Selah
     For you, O God, do hear my vows,
         and grant the desires of those who fear you.
     Add many days to the life of the king;
         may his years endure throughout all generations.
     In the presence of God be he throned forever;
         may kindness and faithfulness watch over him.
     And I will sing praise to your name forever,
         paying my vows day after day.

*Psalm 62 -- Quietness and Confidence*
     For the leader. On jeduthun. A psalm of David.

     I wait alone in silence for God;
         From him comes my help.
     Yes, he is my rock, my help, my retreat,
         I shall not be shaken too sorely.
     How long will you, all of you, batter a man,
         as one might a leaning wall?
     From his height
         they are planning to topple him.
     They take pleasure in falsehood; they bless with their mouth,
         but inwardly they curse. Selah


     I wait alone in silence for God;
         for from him comes my hope.
     Yes, he is my rock, my help, my retreat,
         I shall not be shaken too sorely.
     On God rests my honour and safety,
         in God is my strong rock, my refuge.
     Trust in him, all you people assembled,
         pour out your heart in his presence;
         God is a refuge for us. Selah


     The lowly are nought but a breath,
         the lofty are but an illusion:
     in the balances up they go,
         they are lighter than breath altogether.
     Trust not in gain of extortion,
         set no vain hopes in robbery.
     As for wealth, if it bears fruit,
         set not your heart upon it.


     One thing God has uttered,
         two things there are which I heard
     that power belongs to God,
         and to you, too, O LORD, belongs kindness;
     for you requite each person
         according to what they have done.

*Psalm 63 -- Athirst for God*
     A psalm of David, when he was in the wilderness of Judah.

     O God, my God, you, you do I seek:
         my heart thirsts for you,
     my body faints for you
         in a parched and waterless land.


     As I in the temple have seen you,
         beholding your power and your glory,
     for better than life is your kindness:
         my lips shall utter your praise.


     So, while I live, I will bless you,
         and lift up my hands in your name.
     As with marrow and fat am I feasted;
         with joyful lips I will praise you.


     I call you to mind on my bed,
         and muse on you in the night watches;
     for you have been my help,
         I joyfully sing in the shadow of your wings.
     I cling close after you,
         your right hand holds me up.


     But those who seek after my life
         shall go down to the depths of the earth,
     given o'er to the power of the sword,
         or as prey for jackals to devour.


     But the king shall rejoice in God:
         all who own his allegiance will glory.
         For the mouth of the false shall be stopped.

*Psalm 64 -- A Prayer for Deliverance from Malicious Foes*
     For the leader. A psalm of David.

     Hear, O my God, the voice of my lament:
         guard my life from the dread of the foe.
     Hide me from villains who secretly plot,
         from the blustering throng of the workers of evil,
     who have sharpened their tongue like a sword,
         and aimed bitter words like arrows,
     which from ambush they launch at the blameless,
         shooting swiftly and unafraid.


     They strengthen their wicked purpose,
         they tell of the snares they have hidden,
         they say to themselves, 'Who can see?'
     They think out their crimes full cunningly
         hidden deep in their crafty hearts.


     But God with his arrow will shoot them,
         swiftly shall they be smitten.
     For their tongue he will bring them to ruin,
         all will shudder with horror at the sight of them.


     Then every person, touched to awe,
         as they ponder what God has wrought,
         will tell the tale of his deeds.
     In the LORD shall the righteous rejoice,
         in him shall they take refuge;
         and all the true-hearted shall glory.

*Psalm 65 -- Hymn for a Thanksgiving Festival*
     For the leader. A psalm of David. A song.

     It is seemly to praise you, O God, in Zion,
         and to you shall the vow be performed in Jerusalem.
     O you who hear prayer,
         unto you shall all flesh come.
     Our sins are too mighty for us,
         our transgressions you only can cover them.
     Happy the person who you choose
         to live beside you in your courts.
     O may we be filled with the joys
         of your house, of your holy temple.


     In dread deeds you loyally answer us,
         O God of our salvation,
     whom all ends of the earth put their trust in,
         and islands far away.
     By your strength you establish the hills,
         you are armed with might;
     you still the roaring of seas,
         and the turmoil of nations,
     so that those who live at earth's bounds
         are awed at your signs:
     the lands of the sunrise and sunset
         you make to ring with joy.


     You visit and water the earth;
         you greatly enrich her
     with the river of God, which is full of water.
         You prepare the corn thereof,
     watering her furrows,
         settling her ridges;
     you make her soft with showers,
         and bless what grows thereon.
     You crown the year with your goodness,
         your chariot tracks drip with fatness.
     The desert pastures are lush,
         the hills greened with joy.
     The meadows are clothed with flocks,
         the valleys are covered with corn;
         they shout to each other and sing.

*Psalm 66 -- Thanksgiving for National Deliverance*
     For the leader. A song. A psalm.

     Shout to God, all the earth,
         sing praise to his glorious name,
         sing his glorious praise.
     Say to God, 'How dread are your works,
         so great is your might that your enemies cringe to you.
     All the earth does homage to you,
         singing praises to you,
         singing praise to your name.' Selah


     Come and see what God has done,
         awe-inspiring is he in his works among people.
     He turns the sea into dry land,
         and people cross the river on foot.
     Let us therefore rejoice in him,
         the mighty Ruler eternal,
     whose eyes keep watch on the nations,
         that no rebel lift up his head. Selah


     O bless our God, you peoples;
         sound aloud his praise,
     who keeps us in life,
         and keeps our feet from slipping.
     For you, God, have tested us,
         have tried us, as silver is tried.
     You did bring us into prison,
         and put chains upon us,
     you did let people ride over our head.
         We went through fire and through water,
         but you led us out to a spacious place.


     I will enter your house with burnt-offerings,
         I will pay to you my vows,
     which my open lips have uttered,
         arid my mouth has declared in my straits.
     I will offer you offerings of fatlings,
         with the odour of burning rams,
         I will sacrifice bullocks with goats. Selah


     Come and hear my story
         all who fear God --
         of what he has done for me.
     For my mouth had no sooner invoked him
         than his praise was under my tongue.
     Had I cherished sin in my heart,
         the LORD would never have listened.
     But assuredly God has listened,
         and attended to my loud prayer.


     Blessed be God, who turned not aside
         my prayer, nor withdrew his kindness from me.

*Psalm 67 -- A Harvest Thanksgiving*
     For the leader. On stringed instruments. A psalm. A song.

     Bless us, O God, with your favour,
         let the light of your face fall upon us; Selah
     that the world may know your way,
         and all nations your power to save.


     Let the peoples praise you, O God;
         let the peoples all of them praise you.
     Let the nations ring out their joy;
         for you govern the peoples with equity,
         and guide the nations on earth. Selah
     Let the peoples praise you, O God,
         let the peoples, all of them, praise you.


     The earth has yielded her increase
         by the blessing of God, our God.
     May this blessing of ours win people to him
         to all the ends of the earth.

*Psalm 68 -- Victory*
     For the leader. Of David. A psalm. A song.

     God arises, his enemies scatter:
         they who hate him flee before him.
     As smoke before wind is driven,
         as wax melts before fire,
         so before God vanish the wicked.
     But the righteous rejoice in God's presence,
         they exult with exceeding joy.


     Sing to God, make music to his name,
         his name is the LORD, praise him who rides on the clouds,
             and exult in his presence.
     Father of orphans, defender of widows,
         is God in his holy abode.
     God brings home the lonely,
         he leads forth the prisoner to comfort,
         so that none but the rebel lives cheerless.


     God, when you went in front of your people
         in your march through the desert, Selah
     earth shook, the heavens poured rain
         at the presence of God, Sinai's God
     at the presence of God, Israel's God.
     Rain in abundance, God, you did sprinkle,
         restoring the languishing land of your heritage.
     A dwelling therein your people found:
         in your goodness, O God, you did care for the poor.


     The LORD spoke the glad tidings of victory,
         a great army of women proclaim it:
     'Kings of armies they flee, they flee,
         and the housewife divides the spoil:
     dove's wings covered with silver
         and pinions with shimmer of gold,
         set with stones, like snow upon Zalmon.'


     A mountain of God is the mountain of Bashan,
         a mountain of peaks is the mountain of Bashan.
     You high-peaked mountains, why look you askance
         at the mountain which God has desired for his home
         whereon the LORD will live forever?
     The chariots of God are twice ten thousand:
         the LORD came from Sinai, his holy place.
     You did mount the height with trains of your captives,
         and gifts that you had received from the people.
         The rebels shall live with the LORD God.


     Blest be the LORD who sustains us daily,
         the God who is also our saviour. Selah
         Our God is a God who is saviour.
     The ways of escape from death
         are known to the LORD God.
     Yes, God will shatter the head of his foes
         the rough scalp of those who strut on in their sins.
     The LORD said: 'I will bring you home from Bashan,
         home from the depths of the sea,
     that your feet you may bathe in blood,
         and your dogs lick their share of the foe.'


     In the temple appear God's triumphal processions,
         processions in praise of my king and my God,
     with singers in front, and minstrels behind,
         and maidens with timbrels between them, singing,
     'You of the well-spring of Israel,
         bless the LORD God in the dance.'
     There, in front, is Benjamin the little,
         the princes of Judah beside them,
         the princes of Zebulon, princes of Naphtali.


     God, show your strength,
         your godlike might,
     as you did in the past,
         from your temple that crowns Jerusalem.
     Kings shall bring tribute to you.
         Rebuke the beast of the reed,
     the herd of bulls, with the calves of the peoples.
         Trample down the lovers of lies.
         Scatter the nations whose joy is in war.
     May they come from Egypt with gifts of oil,
         Ethiopia haste with full hands to God.


     Sing to God, O you kingdoms of earth,
         make melody to the LORD. Selah
     Praise him who rides on the ancient heavens.
         See! He utters his voice, his mighty voice.
     Ascribe strength to the God over Israel,
         whose strength and majesty live in the skies.
     Awe-inspiring is God in his holy place,
         it is Israel's God
         who gives strength and might to his people.
             Blessed be God.

*Psalm 69 -- A Prayer for Deliverance and Vengeance*
     For the leader. On shoshannim. Of David.

     Save me, O God; for the waters
         are threatening my life.
     I am sunk in depths of mire,
         where ground there is none.
     I am come into deep deep waters,
         the flood overwhelms me.
     I am weary of crying, my throat is parched,
         my eyes are wasted with waiting for God.


     More than the hairs of my head
         are those who wantonly hate me.
     More than my bones in number
         are those who are falsely my foes.
     That which I never robbed,
         how am I then to restore?
     O God, you know my folly,
         my guilt is not hidden from you.
     Through me let not any be shamed,
         who wait for you, LORD God of hosts.
     Through me let not those be confounded
         who seek you, O God of Israel.
     It's in your cause that I have borne taunts,
         and my face has been covered with shame;
     I became to my kindred a foreigner,
         to my mother's sons a stranger.


     It was zeal for your house that consumed me,
         and the insults they hurled at you fell upon me.
     When I chastened myself with fasting,
         they took occasion to taunt me.
     When I put on a garment of sackcloth,
         they made me the theme of a taunt-song.
     Those who sit in the gate make sport of me
         in the music of drunken songs.


     But I pray to you, LORD,
         for a time of favour.
     In your great love answer me;
         with your loyal help, save me
     from sinking down in the mire.
         Lift me out of the deep deep waters,
     that the rushing flood may not drown me,
         that the deep may not swallow me up,
         nor the pit close her mouth upon me.
     Answer me, LORD, in your gracious kindness,
         turn to me in your great compassion.
     Hide not your face from your servant,
         for I am in trouble; O answer me speedily.
     Draw near to me, redeem me;
         because of my enemies, ransom me.


     You know how I am insulted;
         in your sight are all my foes.
     Insult has broken my heart,
         past cure are my shame and confusion.
     For pity I looked -- there was none!
         And for comforters, but I found none.
     Poison they gave me for food,
         and to slake my thirst they gave vinegar.


     May their table, outspread, be a trap to them,
         and their peace-offerings be a snare.
     May their eyes be darkened and blind,
         make them shake without ceasing.
     Pour your indignation upon them,
         let your burning wrath overtake them.
     May their camp be a desolation,
         in their tents be there none to live.
     For those whom you struck, they persecute,
         and those whom you wounded, they pain yet more.
     Charge them with sin upon sin,
         may they not be acquitted by you.
     From the book of life be they blotted,
         may their names not be written with the righteous.


     Lift me, O God, by your help
         above my pain and misery.
     Then will I praise God in song
         and magnify him with thanksgiving,
     which shall please the LORD better than ox,
         or than bullock with horns and hoofs.
     The oppressed shall rejoice at the sight.
         You who seek after God, let your heart revive.
     For the LORD listens to the poor,
         he does not despise his prisoners.


     Let the heavens and the earth sing his praises,
         the seas, and all creatures that move in them.
     For God will bring help to Zion,
         and build up the cities of Judah,
         his people shall live there in possession.
     His servants' children shall have it for heritage,
         and those who love him shall live therein.

*Psalm 70 -- A Cry for Help in Persecution*
     For the leader. Of David. For commemoration.

     Quickly, God, deliver me,
         hasten to help me, LORD.
     May those who are seeking my life,
         be ashamed and confounded.
     May those who delight in my hurt
         be defeated and brought to dishonour.
     But may all who seek after you
         rejoice and be glad in you.
     May all who love your salvation
         say, 'Glory to God,' evermore.
     I am weak and needy:
         make haste, God, to me.
     You are my help and deliverer;
         LORD, don't delay.

*Psalm 71 -- Forsake me not, when I am Old*


     In you, O LORD, I take refuge,
         let me never be put to shame.
     In your faithfulness save me and rescue me,
         bend your ear to me and save me.
     Be to me a rock of defence,
         a fortified house, to save me;
         for my rock and my fortress are you.


     Save me, my God, from the hand of the wicked,
         from the grasp of the unjust and cruel.
     For you, LORD, are my hope,
         in whom from my youth I have trusted.
     On you have I leaned from my birth;
         from my mother's womb it was you who did draw me.
         In you is my hope evermore.


     I have been as a wonder to many,
         for you are my refuge and strength.
     All the day long my mouth
         is filled with your praise and your glory.
     Cast me not off in the time of old age;
         when my strength is spent, forsake me not.
     For my foes whisper against me,
         they who watch me take counsel together;
     'God has left him,' they say: 'pursue
         and seize him, for he is helpless.'


     O God, be not far from me,
         haste, O my God, to my help.
     Put my foes to shame and dishonour,
         with insult and shame be they covered.
     But I will never stop hoping,
         and more and yet more will I praise you.
     All the day long shall my mouth
         tell your faithfulness and your salvation,
         though I know not how they may be counted.


     I will tell of the might of the LORD,
         and your faithfulness praise, you alone.
     You have taught me, O God, from my youth,
         and till now have I told of your wonders.
     Even in old age and grey hair,
         O God, do not forsake me.
     Still would I tell of your might
         unto all generations to come.


     Your power and your justice, O God,
         extend as far as the heavens:
     for great are the things you have done.
         Who is like you, O God?
     You have caused us to see troubles many,
         but you will revive us again.
     From the depths of the earth
         you will bring me up again.
     You will multiply my greatness,
         and comfort me again.


     So with harp I will praise you,
         and your faithfulness, O my God;
     and make music to you on the lyre,
         O you Holy One of Israel.
     My lips shall ring out their joy,
         my mouth shall sing praises to you;
         all of me, which you have redeemed.
     Yes, all the day long shall my tongue
         utter your righteousness;
     for ashamed and confounded are they
         who were seeking my hurt.

*Psalm 72 -- A Prayer for a Just and Glorious Reign*
     Of Solomon.

     Give the king, O God, your own spirit of justice
         your spirit of right to the son of the king,
     that with right he may judge your people,
         and your downtrodden ones with justice.


     May the mountains bear weal for the people,
         and the hills yield fruits of justice.
     The weak may he help to their rights,
         may he save the sons of the needy
         and crush the oppressor in pieces.


     May he live as long as the sun,
         while the moon shines -- for ages and ages.
     May he be like the rain on the meadow,
         like showers that water the earth.


     In his days may justice flourish,
         and welfare abound, till the moon be no more.
     May he reign from ocean to ocean,
         from the river to the ends of the earth.


     May his foes bow down before him,
         his enemies lick the dust.
     May tribute be rendered by kings
         of the isles and of Tarshish;
     may gifts be brought by the kings
         of Sheba and Seba.


     May all kings fall prostrate before him,
         and all nations yield him their service.
     For he saves the poor when he cries,
         the helpless and the downtrodden.


     He pities the weak and the poor,
         he saves the lives of the poor.
     He redeems them from wrong and from violence,
         for dear is their blood in his sight.


     Long may he live;
         and may gold of Sheba be given him;
     prayer, too, be made for him ceaselessly,
         all the day long may men bless him.


     May the land have abundance of corn,
         to the tops of the hills may it wave.
     May the fruit thereof flourish like Lebanon,
         may men spring from the city like grass of the earth.


     May his name be blessed forever,
         may his fame endure as the sun.
     May all nations envy his blessedness,
         all tribes of the earth call him happy.




             Blest be the LORD God, Israel's God,
             who alone does wonders;
             And blest be forever his glorious name.
             Let all the earth be filled with his glory.
             Amen and Amen.


             Here end the prayers of David, son of Jesse.

                              [Book Three]



*Psalm 73 -- Fellowship with God Here and Hereafter*
     A psalm of Asaph.

     Yes, God is good to the upright,
         the LORD to the pure in heart.
     But my feet were almost gone,
         my steps had nearly slipped,
     through envy of godless braggarts,
         when I saw how well they fared.


     For never a pang have they,
         their body is sound and sleek.
     They have no trouble like mortals,
         no share in human pain.
     So they wear their pride like a necklace,
         they put on the garment of wrong,
     their eyes stand out with fatness,
         their heart swells with riotous fancies.
     Their speech is mocking and evil,
         condescending and crooked their speech.
     They have set their mouth in the heavens,
         while their tongue struts about on the earth.
     Small wonder that people resort to them,
         and drink deep draughts of their lore.
     'How does God know?' they say,
         'And has the Most High any knowledge?'
     See! These are the godless,
         with wealth and ease ever increasing.


     Yes, in vain have I kept my heart pure,
         and washed my hands in innocence;
     for all the day long was I plagued
         not a morning but I was chastised.
     But to resolve to speak like they do
         would be treachery to your children.


     So I sought to understand it,
         but a wearisome task it seemed:
     till I entered the holy world of God
         and saw clearly their destiny.


     Yes, you set them on slippery places;
         down to destruction you hurl them.
     One moment and then what a horror of ruin!
         They are finished and ended in terrors.
     Like a dream, when one wakes, shall they be,
         whose phantoms the waker despises.


     So my bitterness of mind
         and the pain that stabbed my heart
     show how dull I was and stupid
         just like a beast before you.


     But I am always with you,
         you have hold of my right hand.
     By a plan of yours you guide me
         and will afterward take me to glory.


     Whom have I in the heavens but you?
         And on earth there is none I desire beside you.
     Though flesh and heart waste away,
         yet God is the rock of my heart,
         yet God is my portion forever.


     For see! Those who are far from you must perish,
         you destroy all who are false to you.
     But I am happy when close to God;
         the LORD my God I have made my refuge,
         that I may recount all the things you have done.

*Psalm 74 -- Lament on the Devastation of the Temple*
     A maskil of Asaph.

     Why, O God, have you spurned us forever?
         Why smokes your wrath against the sheep of your pasture?
     Remember the community you purchased of old
         to become by redemption the tribe of your heritage,
         Zion, the mountain you made your home.
     Rouse yourself, visit its ruins complete.
         In the temple the foe has made havoc of all things.


     Like lions your enemies roared through your house,
         replacing our symbols by signs of their own,
     hacking, like woodsmen who lift
         axes on thickets of trees,
     smashing with hatchets and hammers
         all of its carved work together.
     They have set your temple on fire,
         to the very ground they have outraged
         the place where lives your name.
     They have said in their heart, 'Let us utterly crush them.'
         They have burned all the houses of God in the land.


     No symbol of ours do we see any more:
         no prophet is there any more,
         none is with us who knows how long.
     How long, O God, is the foe to insult?
         Shall the enemy spurn your name forever?
     Why, O LORD, do you hold back your hand,
         why keep your right hand in the folds of your robe?


     Yet God is our king from the ancient days,
         in the midst of the earth working deeds of salvation.
     It was you who did cleave the sea by your might,
         and shatter the heads of the ocean monsters.
     It was you who did crush many-headed Leviathan,
         and give him as food to the beasts of the wilderness.
     It was you who did cleave the fountains and torrents;
         it was you who did dry the perennial streams.
     Yours is the day; yours, too, is the night,
         it was you who did establish the sun and the star.
     It was you who did fix all the borders of earth:
         summer and winter it's you who have made them.


     Yet, for all this, the foe has insulted you, LORD,
         and a nation of fools has reviled your name.
     Do not give your dove to the beasts,
         do not forget your afflicted forever.
     Look to the sleek ones -- how full they are:
         the dark places of earth are the dwellings of violence.
     O let not the downtrodden turn back ashamed:
         let the poor and the needy sing praise to your name.


     Arise, God, and defend your cause:
         remember how fools all the day insult you.
     Do not forget the uproar of your enemies,
         the din of your foes that ascends evermore.

*Psalm 75 -- God the Judge*
     For the leader; al tashheth. A psalm of Asaph, a song.

     We praise you, God, we praise you:
         we would call on your name and declare your wonders.


     'At the time I choose,
         I will judge fairly.
     Though earth melt and all her inhabitants,
         it is I who keep steady her pillars.' Selah
     I say to the boasters, 'Boast not';
         to the wicked, 'Lift not up your horn:
     lift not your horn on high,
         speak not boldly against the Rock.'


     For not from east nor west,
         not from desert nor mountains;
     but God himself is the judge,
         humbling one and exalting another.


     In the hand of the LORD is a cup
         foaming wine, richly spiced.
     Out of this he pours a draught,
         and all the wicked of earth
         must drain it down to the dregs.


     But I will rejoice forever,
         singing praise to the God of Jacob.
     I will hew all the horns of the wicked,
         but the horns of the just shall be lifted.

*Psalm 76 -- A Song of Victory*
     For the leader. With instrumental music. A psalm of Asaph, a song.

     God has made himself known in Judah,
         his name is great in Israel.
     His tent is in Salem,
         his dwelling in Zion.


     There he broke the lightning arrows,
         shield, sword, and weapons of war. Selah
     Terrible is your splendour
         on the everlasting mountains.


     Despoiled were the stout of heart;
         in the sleep into which they had fallen,
     none of the warriors
         could lift a hand.


     At your rebuke, God of Jacob,
         sank chariot and horse to sleep.
     Awful are you: who can stand
         before you, when once you are angry?


     The judgment you gave from heaven
         frightened the earth into silence,
     when God arose to judgment
         to save the oppressed of the earth. Selah


     The fiercest will praise you,
         to you will the remnant hold festival.
     Vow and pay to LORD your God,
         and let all who are round him bring presents.


     He lops off the courage of princes,
         and with terror fills kings of the earth.

*Psalm 77 -- A Prayer for Preservation as in the Days of Old*
     For the leader. On Jeduthun. Of Asaph, a psalm.

     Loudly will I lift my cry to God,
         loudly to God, so he hears to me.
     In the day of my trouble I seek the LORD;
         in the night I lift my hands in prayer,
         refusing all comfort.


     When I think of God, I moan;
         when I muse, my spirit is faint. Selah
     When you hold my eyes awake,
         and I am restless and speechless,
     I think of the days of old,
         call to mind distant years.
     I commune with my heart in the night,
         I muse with inquiring spirit.
     'Will the LORD cast us off forever,
         will he be gracious no more?
     Has his love vanished forever?
         Is his faithfulness utterly gone?
     Has God forgotten to be gracious,
         or in anger withheld his compassion?' Selah


     Then I said, 'This it is that grieves me,
         that the hand of the Most High has changed.'
     I will think of the deeds of the LORD,
         and remember your wonders of old.
     I will muse on all you have wrought,
         and meditate on your deeds.
     Then your way, O God, was majestic:
         what God was great as our God?
     You were a God who did marvels,
         you did show your power to the world
     by your arm you rescued your people,
         the children of Jacob and Joseph. Selah


     The waters saw you, O God.
         The waters saw you and shivered;
         to their depths they trembled.
     Clouds poured torrents of water,
         thunder rolled in the sky,
         your arrows sped to and fro.
     Loud was the roll of your thunder,
         lightnings lit up the world.
         Earth quaked and trembled.
     In your way, LORD, through the sea,
         in your path through the mighty waters,
         your footsteps were all unseen.
     You did guide your folk like a flock
         by the hand of Moses and Aaron.

*Psalm 78 -- The Warnings of History*
     A maskil of Asaph.

     My people, attend to my teaching:
         bend your ears to the words of my mouth,
     as I open my mouth in a poem
         on the riddling story of the past.


     What we have heard and known,
         and what our ancestors have told us,
     we will not hide from their children.
         We will tell to the next generation
     the praises and might of the LORD,
         and the wonders that he has done.


     He set up a testimony in Jacob,
         a law he appointed in Israel,
     which he commanded our ancestors
         to make known to their children,
     that the next generation should know it,
         that the children yet to be born
     should arise and tell their children;
         that in God they might put their confidence,
     and not forget God's works;
         but that they might keep his commandments,
     and not be like their ancestors,
         a generation defiant and stubborn,
     a generation with heart unsteady,
         and spirit unfaithful towards God.


     Ephraimites, armed bowmen,
         turned back in the day of battle.
     They did not keep God's covenant,
         they refused to walk in his law.
     They forgot what he had done,
         and the wonders he had shown them.


     He did wonders before their ancestors
         in the country of Zoan in Egypt.
     Through the sea which he split he brought them,
         making waters stand up like a heap;
     he led them by day with a cloud,
         all the night with a light of fire.


     From the rocks which he split in the wilderness,
         he gave them to drink as of ocean's abundance.
     He brought streams out of the rock,
         and made water run down like rivers.


     Yet they still went on sinning against him,
         they defied the Most High in the desert.
     They wilfully challenged God,
         demanding the food that they longed for.
     'Is God able,' such was their challenge,
         'to spread in the desert a table?
     From the rock that he struck there gushed water,
         and torrents that overflowed;
     but can he also give bread,
         or provide his people with meat?'


     When the LORD heard this, he was furious,
         and fire was kindled on Jacob,
         anger flared up against Israel.


     For they put no trust in God,
         no confidence in his help.
     So he summoned the clouds above;
         and, opening the doors of heaven,
     he rained manna upon them for food,
         and grain of heaven he gave them.
     Everyone ate the bread of angels;
         he sent them food to the full.


     He launched the east wind in the heavens,
         and guided the south by his power.
     He rained meat upon them like dust,
         winged bird like the sand of the sea.
     In the midst of their camp he dropped it,
         all around their tents.


     They ate and were more than filled;
         he had brought them the thing they desired.
     But the thing they desired became loathsome:
         while their food was still in their mouths,
     the wrath of God rose against them.
         He slew the stoutest among them,
         and laid low the young men of Israel.


     Yet for all this they sinned yet more,
         and refused to believe in his wonders.
     So he ended their days in a breath,
         and their years in sudden dismay.
     When he slew them, then they sought after him,
         they turned and sought God with diligence.


     They remembered that God was their rock,
         and the Most High God their redeemer.
     But they flattered him with their mouth,
         and lied to him with their tongue.
     Their heart was not steady with him,
         they were faithless to his covenant.


     But he is full of pity:
         he pardons sin and destroys not.
     Often he turns his anger away,
         without stirring his wrath at all.
     So he remembered that they were but flesh,
         breath that passes and does not return.


     But how often they rebelled in the desert,
         and caused him grief in the wilderness,
     tempting God again and again,
         provoking the Holy One of Israel.
     They did not remember his strength,
         nor the day he redeemed from the foe,
     how he set his signs in Egypt,
         in the country of Zoan his wonders.


     He turned their canals into blood,
         their streams undrinkable.
     He sent forth flies, which devoured them;
         frogs, too, which destroyed them.
     Their crops he gave to the caterpillar,
         and the fruits of their toil to the locust.
     He slew their vines with hail,
         and their sycamore trees with frost.
     He delivered their cattle to the hail,
         and their flocks to bolts of fire.


     He let loose his hot anger among them,
         fury and wrath and distress,
         a band of destroying angels.
     He cleared a path for his anger,
         did not spare them from death,
         but gave them over to pestilence.


     He struck down all the firstborn in Egypt,
         the first fruits of their strength in the tents of Ham.
     He led forth his people like sheep,
         he was guide to his flock in the desert.
     Securely he led them, and free from fear,
         while their foes were drowned in the sea.


     To his holy realm he brought them,
         to the mountain his right hand had purchased.
     He drove out the nations before them,
         and allotted their land for possession,
         and their tents for Israel to live in.


     Yet they tempted and angered the Most High God,
         they did not observe his decrees.
     They drew back, false like their ancestors;
         they failed like a treacherous bow.
     Their shrines stirred him to anger,
         their idols moved him to jealousy.


     When God heard of this, he was furious,
         and he spurned Israel utterly.
     He abandoned his home in Shiloh,
         the tent he had pitched among people.
     He gave his strength up to captivity,
         his glory to the hands of the foe.


     He gave his people to the sword,
         he was furious with his own.
     Fire devoured their young men,
         and their maidens had no marriage-song.
     Their priests fell by the sword,
         and their widows could not weep.


     Then the LORD awoke as from sleep,
         like a warrior flushed with wine;
     and he beat back his foes,
         putting them to perpetual scorn.
     He disowned the tent of Joseph,
         he rejected the tribe of Ephraim;
     but he chose the tribe of Judah,
         Mount Zion, which he loves.
     And he built like the heights his sanctuary,
         like the earth which he founded forever.


     And he chose David his servant,
         taking him from the sheepfolds.
     From the mother-ewes he brought him,
         to be shepherd to Jacob his people,
         and to Israel his inheritance.
     With upright heart did he shepherd them,
         and with skilful hands did he guide them.

*Psalm 79 -- A National Prayer for Deliverance*
     A psalm of Asaph.

     Heathen, O God, have come into your land,
         defiling your holy temple,
         and laying Jerusalem in ruins.
     They have given the bodies of your dead servants
         to the birds of the air to devour,
         and the flesh of your faithful to the beasts of the field.
     Round about Jerusalem
         they have poured out their blood like water;
         and there was no one to bury them.
     On every side our neighbours
         revile us and mock us and jeer at us.


     How long will you be angry, O LORD?
         Will your jealousy burn like fire forever?
     Pour out your wrath on the nations that don't know you,
         on the kingdoms that do not call on your name.
     For Jacob they devoured,
         they have desolated his home.
     Do not remember against us our ancestors' sins;
         O meet us soon with your pity,
         for utterly weak are we.


     Help us, O God our saviour,
         for the renown of your name:
     for your reputation deliver us
         and cover over our sins.
     Why should the nations say,
         'Where is their God?'
     Let revenge for the outpoured blood of your servants
         be shown on the heathen before our eyes.
     May the groans of the prisoner come before you;
         free the children of death by your mighty arm.
     Pay our neighbours back sevenfold
         for the scorn they have heaped upon you, O LORD.


     Then we, your people, the flock of your pasture,
         will give thanks to you for evermore,
         and tell your praise to all generations.

*Psalm 80 -- A Prayer for the Preservation of Israel*
     For the leader. On shoshannim, eduth. Of Asaph, a psalm.

     Listen, Shepherd of Israel,
         who leads Joseph like a flock of sheep;
     from your throne on the cherubs shine forth
         before Ephraim, Manasseh, and Benjamin.
     Stir up your mighty power,
         come to our help.
     God, restore us:
         show us the light of your face,
         so we may be saved.


     O LORD of hosts,
     how long is your anger to smoke,
         despite the prayer of your people?
     You have fed them with bread of tears,
         you have made them drink tears by the measure.
     The scorn of our neighbours you make us,
         the laughing-stock of our foes.
     God of hosts, restore us:
         show us the light of your face,
         so we may be saved.


     A vine out of Egypt you brought;
         you did drive out the nations, and plant her;
     in the ground you did clear she struck root,
         and she filled all the land.
     The shade of her covered the mountains,
         her branches the cedars of God.
     She sent forth her shoots to the sea,
         and her branches as far as the River.
     Why have you torn down her fences, and left her
         to be plucked at by all who pass by,
     to be gnawed by the boar from the forest,
         and devoured by the beasts of the field?


     O God of hosts, return:
         look down from heaven and see
     and visit this vine, and restore her
         the vine which your right hand has planted.
     She is burned with fire and cut down
         before your stern face they are perishing.
     Support the one you have chosen,
         the one you have raised for yourself;
     then from you we will never draw back.
         Preserve us, and we will call on your name.
     LORD, God of hosts, restore us:
         Show us the light of your face,
         so we may be saved.

*Psalm 81 -- For the Feast of Tabernacles*
     For the leader. On the gittith. Of Asaph.

     Sing aloud to God our strength,
         shout for joy to the God of Jacob.
     Raise a song, sound the timbrel,
         sweet lyre and harp.
     On the new moon blow the horn,
         at the full moon, the day of our festival.
     For this is a statute for Israel,
         a ruling of the God of Jacob,
     a witness he set up in Joseph,
         when he marched against Egypt's land,
         where he heard an unknown voice say:


     'I removed from your shoulder the burden,
         and freed your hands from the basket.
     At your call of distress I delivered you,
         from the thundercloud I answered you.
         At Meribah's waters I tested you. Selah


     'Listen, my people, to my warning,
         O Israel, if you would but listen!
     There must not be a strange god among you,
         you must bow to no foreign god.
     I am the LORD your God
         who brought you up out of Egypt.
         Open your mouth, that I fill it.


     'But my people did not listen to my voice,
         Israel would have none of me.
     So to their own hard hearts I left them,
         to follow their own devices.
     O that my people would listen,
         that Israel would walk in my ways.
     Soon would I humble their enemies,
         and turn my hand on their foes.
     Those who hate the LORD would cringe before him
         in everlasting terror.
     But you would I feed with the richest wheat,
         and with honey from the rock to your heart's desire.'

*Psalm 82 -- God the Upholder of Justice*
     A psalm of Asaph.

     God has taken his stand
         in the divine assembly:
         in the midst of the gods he holds judgment.
     'How long will you crookedly judge,
         and favour the wicked? Selah
     Do right by the weak and the orphan,
         acquit the innocent poor.
     Rescue the weak and the needy,
         save them from the hand of the wicked.


     'They have neither knowledge nor insight,
         in darkness they walk to and fro,
         while the earth's foundations totter.
     It was I who appointed you gods,
         children of the Most High all of you.
     Yet like mortals you will surely die,
         you will fall like any prince.'


     Arise, O God, judge the earth,
         for all nations are yours by inheritance.

*Psalm 83 -- A Prayer for the Destruction of the Enemies of Judah*
     A song, a psalm of Asaph.

     Do not keep silent, O God:
         hold not your peace, be not still, God.
     For see! Your enemies roar,
         those who hate you lift up their heads,
     laying crafty plans for your people,
         and plotting against those you treasure.
     'Come, let us wipe them out as a nation,
         so Israel's name will be mentioned no more.'


     For, conspiring with one accord,
         they have made a league against you
     Tents of Edom, and Ishmaelites,
         Moab, and the Hagrites.
     Gebal and Ammon and Amalek,
         Philistia, with the people of Tyre;
     Syria, too, is confederate,
         they have strengthened the children of Lot. Selah


     Deal with them as you dealt with Midian,
         with Sisera, with Jabin, at the torrent of Kishon,
     who at Endor were destroyed,
         and became dung for the field.
     Make their nobles like Oreb and Zeeb,
         all their princes like Zebah and Zalmunna,
     who said, 'Let us take for ourselves
         the meadows of God.'


     Whirl them, my God, like dust,
         like stubble before the wind.
     As the fire that kindles the forest,
         as flame that sets mountains ablaze,
     so with your tempest pursue them,
         terrify them with your hurricane.
     Make them blush with shame;
         until they seek your name, O LORD.
     Everlasting shame and confusion,
         disgrace and destruction be theirs.
     Teach those who you alone
         are most high over all the earth.

*Psalm 84 -- The Song of the Pilgrims*
     For the leader. On the gittith. Of the Korahites, a psalm.

     How dearly loved is the place where you live,
         LORD of hosts!
     How I long and yearn
         for the courts of the LORD.
     Now heart and flesh cry for joy
         to the living God.


     Even the sparrow has found her a home
         and the swallow a nest,
     to lay her young,
         near your altar,
     LORD of hosts,
         my king and my God.
     Happy those who live in your house,
         praising you evermore. Selah


     Happy those whose strength is in you,
         people with pilgrim hearts.
     As they pass through the valley of tears,
         they make it a place of fountains,
         clothed with the blessings of early rain.
     From rampart to rampart on they march,
         till at last God reveals himself in Zion.


     LORD, God of hosts, hear my prayer,
         attend, O God of Jacob. Selah
     Behold, O God, our defender,
         and look upon your anointed,
     for better a single day in your courts
         than a thousand in my own chambers:
     better stand at the door of the house of my God
         than live in the tents of ungodliness,
     for the LORD is sun and shield,
         the LORD gives grace and glory.
     He withholds no good thing from the life that is blameless.
     LORD of hosts,
         happy those whose trust is in you.

*Psalm 85 -- A Prayer for National Restoration*
     For the leader. Of the Korahites, a psalm.

     Once, LORD, you did favour your land,
         granting change of fortune to Jacob,
     forgiving the guilt of your people,
         pardoning all their sin, Selah
     withdrawing all your fury,
         turning from your hot anger.


     Restore us, O God our saviour,
         put away your displeasure against us.
     Will you cherish your anger against us forever,
         prolonging your wrath to all generations?
     Will you not revive us again,
         that your people may be glad in you?
     Show us your kindness, O LORD,
         grant us your salvation.


     Let me hear what God the LORD will speak;
         for he will speak of peace
     to his people, to those who love him,
         and turn their hearts to him.
     Soon those who fear him shall see how he saves,
         and glory shall live in our land.


     Kindness and loyalty meet;
         peace and righteousness kiss.
     Loyalty springs from the earth;
         righteousness looks from the sky.
     The LORD shall give all that is good,
         our land yielding its increase,
     righteousness marching before him,
         and peace on the path he treads.

*Psalm 86 -- A Prayer for Divine Guidance and Favour*
     A prayer of David.

     Incline your ear, LORD, and answer me,
         for I am afflicted and needy.
     Guard me, for I am loyal:
         save your servant, who trusts in you.
     LORD, be gracious to me, for you are my God;
         I cry to you all the day.
     Gladden the heart of your servant;
         for to you, LORD, I set my hope.
     For you, LORD, are good and forgiving,
         rich in love towards all who call on you.


     Listen, O LORD, to my prayer;
         attend to my plea for mercy.
     In the day of my trouble I call on you,
         with assurance that you will answer me.
     None of the gods is like you, LORD,
         nor are any works like yours.
     All the nations you have made
         will come and bow down before you,
         giving glory, O LORD, to your name.
     For great are you, and a doer of wonders;
         you alone are God.


     Teach me, O LORD, your way,
         that I may walk in your truth:
         so my heart shall rejoice in your name.
     I will give you thanks, O LORD,
         with all my heart, my God,
         I will honour your name forever.
     For great is your love towards me,
         from the depths of Sheol you have saved me.


     Haughty men have risen up against me, O God,
         a band of the violent seeking my life,
         who think nothing of you.
     But you are a God of pity and grace,
         patient and rich in kindness and faithfulness;
         turn to me with your grace, O LORD.
     Grant your strength to your servant,
         and save the child of your handmaid.
     Show me a sign of your favour,
         which those who hate me may see with confusion,
         since you, LORD, are my helper and comforter.

*Psalm 87 -- Zion, City of God*
     Of the Korahites, a psalm. A song.

     On the holy mountain stands
         the city he founded.
     The LORD loves the gates of Zion
         more than all the dwellings of Jacob.
     Glorious things he is speaking of you,
         you city of God. Selah


     'Among those who are mine I name Rahab and Babylon,
         Philistia, Tyre, Ethiopia,
         their people will say I was born in Zion.
     As for Zion it will be said
         each and all were born in her.'
     The LORD will preserve her.


     The LORD will count, when enrolling the peoples,
         'This one was born there, and that one was born there.' Selah
     Singers and dancers alike will say
         'All my springs are in you.'

*Psalm 88 -- The Prayer of Despair*
     A Song, a psalm of the Korahites. To the leader: according to
Mahalath Leannoth. A Maskil of Heman the Ezrahite.

     O LORD my God,
         I cry for help in the day-time,
         in the night my cry is before you;
     let my prayer come into your presence,
         incline your ear to my cry.


     For I am sated with sorrow,
         my life draws near to Sheol.
     I am counted with those who go down to the pit;
          without strength am I.


     My home is among the dead,
         like the slain that lie in the grave,
     whom you remember no more
         cut off as they are from your hand.


     In the deepest pit you have put me,
         in shadows deep and dark.
     Your wrath lies heavy upon me,
         waves of your anger roll over me. Selah


     You have put my friends far from me,
         you have made them shun me.
     I am shut in, and cannot escape,
         my eyes are wasted with sorrow.
     I call on you, LORD, every day,
         spreading my hands out to you.


     For the dead can you work wonders?
         Can the shades rise again to praise you? Selah
     Can your kindness be told in the grave,
         your faithfulness in the tomb?
     Can your wonders be known in the darkness,
         or your help in the land of forgetfulness?


     I cry for help to you,
         in the morning my prayer comes before you.
     Why, O LORD, do you spurn me,
         and hide your face from me?
     From my youth I am wretched and dying,
         I am numbed by the terrors I bear.


     The fires of your wrath have passed over me,
         your terrors destroy me,
     surging around me forever,
         hemming me in altogether.
     Those who love me you put far from me;
         the dark is my only friend.

*Psalm 89 -- The Promise to David*
     A Maskil of Ethan the Ezrahite.

     I will sing evermore of the love of the LORD,
         proclaiming to all generations his faithfulness.
     For your love you did promise to build up forever,
         your faithfulness firm as the heavens themselves.


     'I have made with my chosen a covenant,
         and sworn to David my servant,
     to establish his seed forever,
         and to build up his throne to all ages.' Selah


     Then the holy assembly in heaven
         praised your marvellous faithfulness, LORD.
     For who in the skies may compare with the LORD?
         Who is like the LORD among the gods?


     A God to be feared in the holy assembly,
         awful and great above all who are round him.
     O LORD God of hosts, who is mighty as you?
         Your strength and faithfulness, LORD, surround you.


     You are the LORD of the raging sea:
         when its waves surge, it is you who still them.
     It was you who did pierce and crush Rahab in pieces,
         and scatter your foes by your mighty arm.


     Yours are the heavens, yours also the earth,
         the world and its fulness, it's you who did found them.
     The north and the south, it's you have created them;
         Tabor and Hermon shout praise to your name.


     You have an arm with the might of a hero;
         strong is your hand, high uplifted your right hand.
     Justice and right are the base of your throne,
         kindness and faithfulness ever attend you.


     Happy the people who know the glad shout,
         who walk, O LORD, in the light of your face.
     They exult in your name all the day,
         and your righteousness they extol.


     For you are our strength and our pride.
         Your favour will lift us to honour.
     For the holy LORD of Israel
         keeps our defender and king.


     In a vision of old you did speak
         in this way to the one whom you loved:
     'A crown I have set on the hero
         I chose to be over the people


     'I found my servant David,
         and anointed with holy oil.
     My hand will be with him forever,
         my arm will give him strength.


     'No enemy will dare to assail him,
         nor the wicked to oppress him;
     but his foes I will shatter before him,
         I will strike down those who hate him.


     'My loyal love shall attend him,
         and I will lift him to honour.
     I will set his hand on the sea,
         and his right hand on the rivers.


     'As for him, he will call me "My father,
         my God, and my rock of salvation."
     And I will make him my firstborn,
         highest of kings on the earth.


     'My love will I keep for him ever,
         my covenant with him shall stand fast.
     His line will I make everlasting,
         and his throne as the days of the heavens.


     'If his children forsake my law,
         and walk not as I have ordained;
     if they profane my statutes,
         and do not keep my commandments;


     'I will punish their sin with the rod,
         their iniquity with scourges.
     But my love will I not take from him,
         nor will I belie my faithfulness.


     'I will not profane my covenant
         by changing the word that has passed my lips.
     Once have I solemnly sworn
         and I would not lie to David,


     'that his line should endure forever,
         and his throne as the sun before me,
     firm as the moon which for ever
         and ever is fixed in the sky.' Selah


     But you have cast off in contempt,
         and been furious with your anointed.
     You have spurned the covenant with your servant,
         and his sacred crown dashed to the ground.


     You have broken down all his walls,
         and laid his bulwarks in ruins.
     All who pass on their way despoil him,
         the scorn of his neighbours is he now.


     You have given his foes the victory,
         and made all his enemies glad.
     You have turned back his sword from the foe,
         you did not lift him up in the battle.


     The sceptre you took from his hand,
         and his throne you did hurl to the ground.
     You have shortened the days of his youth,
         and covered him with shame. Selah


     How long, LORD will you hide you forever?
         How long are the fires of your wrath to burn?
     Remember, LORD, the shortness of life
         how fleeting you made all people.


     Who can live without seeing death?
         Who can rescue their life from the clutch of Sheol? Selah
     Where, LORD, is your kindness of old,
         which you in your faithfulness swore to David?


     Remember, O LORD, how your servants are mocked,
         how I bear in my heart the scorn of all nations
     The scorn which your enemies hurl, O LORD,
         which they hurl at the footsteps of your anointed.




             Blest be the LORD, for ever and ever.
             Amen and Amen.

                              [Book Four]



*Psalm 90 -- Hymn of Eternity*
     A prayer of Moses, the man of God.

     LORD, you have been a home to us
         one generation after another.
     Before the mountains were born,
         or the earth and the world were brought forth,
     from everlasting to everlasting
         you are God.


     You bring us back to the dust,
         you summon mortals to return.
     For you see a thousand years
         as the passing of yesterday,
         as a watch in the night.


     Your floods sweep them away;
     they are like a dream,
         or like grass which sprouts in the morning,
     which blossoms and sprouts in the morning,
         but by evening is cut and withered.


     For your anger consumes us,
         the heat of your wrath confounds us.
     Our sins you have set before you,
         our secrets in the light of your face.
     For through your wrath our days are declining,
         we bring our years to an end as a sigh.


     The span of our life is seventy years,
         or, if we are strong, maybe eighty;
     yet is their breadth but empty toil,
         for swiftly they go, and we fly away.


     Who lays to heart the power of your anger?
         Or who stands in reverent awe of your wrath?
     O teach us to count our days
         so our minds may learn wisdom.


     Return, O LORD; why so long?
         Relent on your servants.
     Grant us your love to the full in the morning,
         that all our days we may shout for joy.


     Make us glad for the days you have humbled us,
         for the evil years we have seen.
     Let your servants see you in action,
         show your majesty to their children.
     Let the grace of the LORD our God be upon us,
         uphold what our hands are striving to do.

*Psalm 91 -- In the Shelter of the Most High*


     You whose home is the shelter of God Most High,
         whose abode is the shadow of God Almighty,
     can say to the LORD, 'My refuge, my fortress,
         my God, in whom I trust.'


     For he saves you from fowler's snare,
         from deadly plague,
     he shelters you with his pinions,
         and under his wings you can hide.


     His truth will be a shield and buckler.


     You need not fear the terror of night,
         nor the arrow that flies by day,
     nor the plague that stalks in darkness,
         nor the pestilence raging at noon.


     A thousand may fall at your side,
         ten thousand at your right hand:
     but it will not draw near to you.


     You will only look on with your eyes,
         and see how the wicked are punished.
     You have made the LORD your refuge,
         you have made the Most High your defence.


     You will never be met by misfortune,
         no plague will come near your tent,
     for he orders his angels to guard you,
         wherever you go.


     They will carry you with their hands,
         so you don't hurt your foot on a stone.
     You will trample down lions and snakes,
         tread on young lions and cobras.


     'Because of their love for me, I will deliver them,
         I will protect those who trust my name.
     I will answer their cry and be with them in trouble,
         bringing them forth into safety and honour.
     I will give them a life of many days,
         I will show them my salvation.'

*Psalm 92 -- The Ways of God*
     A psalm. A song; for the sabbath day.

     It is good to give thanks to the LORD,
         to sing praise to your name, O Most High,
     to declare your love in the morning,
         and your faithfulness in the night,
     with voice and a ten-stringed harp,
         with music that throbs on the lyre.
     For you make me glad by your deeds, LORD,
         at the work of your hands I will ring out my joy.


     How great are your works, O LORD;
         how deep are your thoughts!
     The insensitive cannot know,
         nor can a fool understand,
     that, though the wicked flourish like grass,
         and evildoers all blossom,
         they will perish forever.


     But you are exalted forever.
     For see! Your enemies, LORD
         For see! Your enemies perish,
         all evildoers are scattered.
     But you lift me to honour,
         and anoint me afresh with oil.
     My eyes will feast on my foes,
         and my ears will hear of the doom of the wicked.


     The righteous will sprout like the palm,
          will grow like a cedar of Lebanon.
     In the house of the LORD are they planted,
         in the courts of our God they will sprout.
     They will still bear fruit in old age,
         all sappy and fresh will they be
     So they proclaim the LORD to be just,
         my rock, in whom is no wrong.

*Psalm 93 -- The Lord, King of all the World*


     The LORD has taken his seat on the throne,
         clothed with majesty, armed with might.
     Now the world stands firm, to be shaken no more,
         firm stands your throne from all eternity.
             You are from everlasting.


     The floods, O LORD, have lifted,
         the floods have lifted their voice,
         the floods lift up their roar.
     But more grand than the great roaring waters,
         more grand than the ocean waves,
         grand on the height stands the LORD.


     What you have ordained is most sure;
         most sure shall your house stand inviolate,
         O LORD, for ever and ever.

*Psalm 94 -- A Prayer for Vengeance on the Cruel*


     LORD, God of vengeance,
         God of vengeance, shine forth.
     Rise up, judge of the earth,
         pay back the proud what they deserve.


     LORD, how long shall the wicked,
         how long shall the wicked exult,
     with their blustering arrogant words,
         their braggart and wicked speech,
     crushing your people, LORD,
         and afflicting your heritage,
     murdering widows and strangers,
         slaying the fatherless?
     They think that the LORD does not see,
         nor the God of Jacob regard it.


     Take heed, you dullest of people;
         when will you be wise, you fools?
     Is he deaf, who shaped the ear?
         Is he blind, who fashioned the eye?
     Can he who trains nations not punish them
         he who teaches knowledge to people?
     The LORD knows the thoughts of people,
         that only a breath are they.


     Happy are those whom you chasten,
         and teach out of your law,
     keeping them calm in the day of misfortune,
         till a pit be dug for the wicked.


     For the LORD will not leave his people,
         he will not forsake his inheritance.
     For the righteous shall come to their rights,
         and all true-hearted people shall follow them.


     Who will rise up for me against those who do evil?
         Who will stand up for me against workers of wrong?
     Were it not for the help of the LORD,
         I would soon have gone to the silent grave.
     When I thought that my foot was slipping,
         your kindness, LORD, held me up.
     When with cares my heart was crowded,
         your comforts make me glad.


     Can corrupt justice be your ally,
         framing mischief by statute?
     They assail the life of the righteous,
         and innocent blood condemn.
     But the LORD is my sure retreat,
         my God is the rock of my refuge.
     He will bring back their sin upon them,
         for their wickedness he will destroy them;
         the LORD our God will destroy them.

*Psalm 95 -- For a Festival. A Hymn of Praise and a Solemn Warning*


     Come! Let us ring out our joy to the LORD,
         let us merrily shout to our rock of salvation.
     Before his face let us come with thanks,
         with songs of praise let us shout to him.


     For the LORD is a great God,
         king above all gods.
     In his hand are the depths of the earth,
         the heights of the mountains are his.
     The sea is his, for he made it:
         the dry land was formed by his hands.


     Come! Let us worship and bow
         on our knees to the LORD our creator.
     For he is our God; and we
         are the people he tends, the sheep in his care.


     If only you would heed his voice today:
     'Do not harden your hearts as at Meribah,
         or at Massah, that day in the desert,
     when your ancestors tempted and tried me,
         though they had seen my deeds.


     'For forty years I was filled with loathing
         for that generation, so I said:
     "A people with wandering hearts are they,
         and ignorant of my ways."
     So I solemnly swore to them in my anger,
         that never would they enter my place of rest.'

*Psalm 96 -- The Lord's Rule*


     Sing to the LORD a new song,
         sing to the LORD, all the earth.
     Sing to the LORD, bless his name,
         from day to day herald his victory.
     Tell his glory among the nations,
         his wonders among all peoples.


     For great is the LORD and worthy all praise;
         held in awe, above all gods:
     for all the gods of the nations are idols,
         but the LORD created the heavens.
     Before him are splendour and majesty,
         beauty and strength in his holy place.


     Ascribe to the LORD, you tribes of the nations,
         ascribe to the LORD glory and strength.
     Ascribe to the LORD the glory he manifests:
         bring you an offering, enter his courts.
     Bow to the LORD in holy array:
         tremble before him, all the earth.


     Say to the nations, 'The LORD is king.'
         The world stands firm to be shaken no more.
         He will judge the peoples with equity.
     Let the heavens be glad and the earth rejoice,
         let the sea and its fulness thunder.


     Let the field, and all that is in it, exult;
         let the trees of the forest ring out their joy
     before the LORD: for he comes,
         he comes to judge the earth.
     He will judge the world with justice
         and the nations with faithfulness.

*Psalm 97 -- The Lord's Judgment*


     The LORD is king, let the earth rejoice:
         let her many isles be glad.
     Clouds and darkness are round about him,
         justice and right are the base of his throne.
     Fire goes before him,
         and blazes around his steps,
     his lightnings illumine the world:
         the earth quakes at the sight.
     Mountains melt like wax
         before the LORD of all the earth.
     The heavens proclaim his justice,
         all nations behold his glory.


     Shamed are all image-worshippers,
         who make a boast of their idols.
         All the gods bow before him.
     Zion is glad at the tidings,
         the towns of Judah rejoice
         because of your judgments, LORD.
     For you are most high over all the earth,
         greatly exalted above all gods.


     The LORD loves those who hate evil,
         he guards the lives of the faithful:
         from the hand of the wicked he saves them.
     Light arises for the righteous,
         and joy for the upright in heart.
     Rejoice in the LORD, you righteous:
         give thanks to his holy name.

*Psalm 98 -- A Song of Praise to the Lord*
     A psalm.

     Sing a new song to the LORD,
         for he has done wonders;
     his right hand and holy arm
         have won him the victory.
     The LORD has made his victory known,
         and revealed to the eyes of the nations his righteousness.
     Mindful he was of his kindness to Jacob,
         faithful he was to the house of Israel.
     All the ends of the earth have seen
         the victory of our God.


     Shout, all the earth, to the LORD:
         break into cries and music.
     Play on the lyre to the LORD,
         on the lyre and with loud melody.
     With trumpet and sound of horn,
         shout before the king.


     Let the sea and its fulness roar,
         the world and the dwellers upon it.
     Let the streams clap their hands,
         let the hills shout for gladness together
     before the LORD for he comes,
         he comes to judge the earth.
     He will judge the world with justice
         and the nations with equity.

*Psalm 99 -- The Lord's Just and Holy Rule*


     The LORD is king; let the nations tremble:
         he is throned upon cherubs; let earth quake.
     The LORD is great in Zion,
         he is high over all the nations.
     Let them praise your great and terrible name.
             Holy is he.


     You are a king who loves justice,
         equity you have established:
         justice and right you have wrought for Jacob.
     Exalt the LORD our God,
         bow down at his footstool.
             Holy is he.


     Among his priests were Moses and Aaron,
         Samuel among those who called on his name.
         They called to the LORD, and he gave them answer.
     He spoke to them in the pillar of cloud,
         they kept his commands and the statute he gave them.
         LORD our God, you gave them answer.
     A God of forgiveness were you to them,
         who suffered their deeds to go unpunished.
     Exalt the LORD our God;
         bow down at his holy mountain.
             For holy is the LORD our God.

*Psalm 100 -- A Call to Worship*
     A psalm of praise.

     Shout, all the earth, to the LORD.
         Serve the LORD with gladness,
         approach him with ringing cries.
     Be sure that the LORD alone is God.
         It is he who has made us, and his we are
         his people, the sheep of his pasture.


     Enter his gates with thanksgiving,
         his courts with praise.
     Give thanks to him, bless his name.
     For the LORD is good, his love is forever,
         and to all ages endures his faithfulness.

*Psalm 101 -- A Model King*
     Of David, a psalm.

     If kindness and justice I sing,
         making melody to you, LORD.
     I would look to the way that is blameless,
         and make it my own.


     Within my own house I would walk
         with an innocent heart.
     I would never direct my eyes
         to a thing that is base.


     The impulse to stray I abhor
         it shall not cling to me.
     Far from me be perverseness of heart,
         or kinship with evil.


     Who slanders their neighbour in secret,
         I bring them to silence:
     haughty looks and proud hearts
         I will not abide.


     I will favour the true in the land,
         they shall live in my court.
     Those who walk in a way that is blameless
         will be my attendant.


     No one will live in my house
         who practises guile.
     No one that speaks a lie
         will abide in my presence.


     Morn by morn I will wholly wipe out
         all the bad in the land,
     and cut off from the LORD's own city
         all workers of evil.

*Psalm 102 -- A Prayer for Pity and for the Restoration of Zion*
     The prayer: for a weary and suffering person who pours out their
grief to the LORD.

     Hear my prayer, O LORD;
         let my cry for help come to you.
     Hide not your face from me
         in the day of my distress.
     Incline your ear to me:
         when I call, answer me speedily.


     For my days pass away like smoke:
         my bones are burned through as with fire.
     My heart is scorched, withered like grass;
         I forget to eat my bread.
     By reason of my loud groaning,
         my flesh clings to my bones.


     Like a desert-owl of the wilderness,
         like an owl among ruins am I.
     I make my sleepless lament
         like a bird on the house-top alone.
     All the day wild foes revile me,
         using my name for a curse.


     For ashes have been my bread,
         and tears have been mixed with my cup.
     Because of your passionate anger,
         you did raise me, then hurl me to the ground.
     My days come to an end, shadows lengthen,
         I wither like grass.


     But you, O LORD, are enthroned forever,
         your fame endures to all generations.
     You will arise and have pity on Zion;
         it's time to be gracious; her hour has come.
     For even her stones are dear to your servants,
         even the dust of her ruins they look on with love.


     Then the nations will revere the name of the LORD
         and all the kings of the earth his glory,
     when the LORD shall have built up Zion,
         and revealed himself in his glory,
     in response to the prayer of the destitute,
         whose prayer he will not despise.


     Let this be recorded for ages to come,
         that the LORD may be praised by a people yet unborn.
     For he shall look down from his holy height,
         from the heavens the LORD will gaze on the earth,
     to hear the groans of the prisoner,
         to free those who are doomed to die;
     that people may recount the LORD's fame in Zion,
         and the praise of him in Jerusalem,
     when the nations are gathered together,
         and the kingdoms, to worship the LORD.


     He has broken my strength on the way,
         he has shortened my days.
     I will say, 'My God, take me not hence
         in the midst of my days.


     'Your years endure age after age.
         Of old you have founded the earth,
         and the heavens are the work of your hands.
     They shall perish; but you do stand.
         They shall all wax old like a garment,
         and change as a robe you will change them.
     But you are the same, your years are endless.
         The children of your servants abide,
         evermore shall their seed be before you.'

*Psalm 103 -- Bless the Lord, O my Soul*
     Of David.

     O my soul, bless the LORD;
         and all that is in me, his holy name.
     O my soul, bless the LORD;
         and forget not one of his benefits.
     He pardons all your sins,
         he heals all your diseases.
     He ransoms your life from the pit,
         he crowns you with kindness and pity.
     He gives you your heart's desire,
         renewing your youth like the eagle's.


     The LORD executes justice --
         and right for all who are wronged.
     He revealed his ways to Moses,
         his acts to the children of Israel.
     Full of pity and grace is the LORD,
         patient, and rich in kindness:
     he will not always chide,
         nor cherish his anger forever.
     Not after our sins has he dealt with us,
         nor requited us after our wickedness.


     For high as the heavens o'er the earth
         is his love over those who fear him.
     Far as is east from the west
         has he put our transgressions from us.
     As a father pities his children,
         so the LORD pities those who fear him;
     for well he knows our frame,
         he remembers that we are dust.


     A person's days are as grass;
         blossoms like a flower of the meadow.
     At the breath of the wind it is gone,
         and the place thereof knows it no more.
     But the love of the LORD is eternal,
         and his kindness to children's children,
     to those who keep his covenant
         and mindfully do his behests.


     The LORD has set his throne in the heavens;
         the whole world is under his sway.
     Bless the LORD, you angels of his,
         mighty heroes performing his word.
     Bless the LORD, all you his hosts,
         you servants who do his will.
     Bless the LORD, all you his works,
         far as his sway extends.
         O my soul, bless the LORD.

*Psalm 104 -- The Hymn of Creation*


     Bless the LORD, O my soul.
     O LORD my God, you are very great,
         clad in awful splendour,
         covered with robe of light.
     You stretch out the heavens like the cloth of a tent.
         He lays the beams of his chambers on water.
     He takes dark clouds for his chariot,
         and rides on the wings of the wind.
     He takes the winds for his messengers,
         the fire and the flame for his servants.


     He founded the earth upon pillars,
         to sustain it unshaken forever.
     With the garment of ocean he covered it,
         waters towered over the mountains.
     But at your rebuke they fled,
         scared by the roar of your thunder,
     mountains rose, valleys sank down
         to the place appointed for them.
     They dared not pass the bounds set for them,
         or cover the earth any more.


     He sent brooks into the valleys,
         they meander between the mountains.
     The wild beasts all drink from them,
         and the wild asses quench their thirst.
     The birds have their home by the banks,
         and sing in the branches.
     From his chambers above he gives drink to the mountains,
         and satisfies earth with the vials of heaven.


     He makes grass grow for the cattle,
         and herbs for people.
     He brings bread out of the earth;
         wine, to gladden hearts;
     oil, to make faces shine;
         bread, to strengthen hearts.
     The trees of the LORD drink their fill
         the cedars he planted on Lebanon,
     where the little birds build their nest,
         and the stork whose home is the cypress.
     The high hills are for the wild goats,
         and the rocks are for coneys to hide in.


     He created the moon to mark seasons,
         and told the sun when to set.
     You make it dark: night comes,
         when all the wild beasts creep out.
     Young lions that roar for their prey,
         seeking their meat from God.
     At sunrise they slink away,
         and lie down in their dens.
     Then people go forth to their work,
         and toil till evening.


     How many, O LORD, are your works,
         all of them made in wisdom!
         The earth is filled with your creatures.
     And there is the great broad sea,
         where are countless things in motion,
         living creatures, both great and small.
     There go the ships,
         and the Leviathan you made to play there.


     They all look in hope to you,
         to give them their food in due season.
     And you give with open hand;
         they gather and eat to their heart's desire.
     When you hide your face, they are terrified;
         when you take their breath away,
         they die and go back to their dust.
     But a breath from your lips creates them,
         and renews the face of the earth.


     May the glory of the LORD be forever,
         may the LORD rejoice in his works.
     A glance of his makes the earth tremble,
         a touch of his makes the hills smoke.
     I will sing to the LORD while I live,
         I will play to my God while I am.
     May my musing be sweet to him,
         for I rejoice in the LORD.
     But may sinners be swept from the earth,
         and the wicked vanish forever.
         O my soul, bless the LORD.
             Hallelujah.

*Psalm 105 -- The Inspiration of the Past*


     Give thanks to the LORD, call on his name:
         make known his deeds among the nations.
     Sing to him, make music to him,
         tell of all his wondrous works.
     Make your boast in his holy name,
         be glad at heart, you who seek the LORD.
     Seek after the LORD and his strength,
         seek his face evermore.
     Remember the wonders he did,
         his portents, the judgments he uttered,
     you who are offspring of Abraham, his servant,
         the children of Jacob, his chosen ones.


     He is the LORD our God:
         in all the earth are his judgments.
     He remembers forever his covenant,
         his promise for a thousand generations
     The covenant he made with Abraham,
         the oath he swore to Isaac,
     and confirmed as a statute to Jacob,
         a pact everlasting to Israel
     to give them the land of Canaan
         as the lot which they should inherit.


     And when they were very few,
         few and but pilgrims therein,
     wandering from nation to nation,
         journeying from people to people,
     he allowed no one to oppress them,
         even punishing kings for their sakes.
     He forbade them to touch his anointed,
         or do any hurt to his prophets.


     When he called down famine on the land,
         and cut off the bread which sustained them,
     he sent before them a man,
         Joseph, who was sold as a slave.
     His feet were galled with fetters,
         he was laid in chains of iron,
     till the time that his word came to pass,
         the word of the LORD that had tried him.


     The king sent and freed him,
         the ruler of nations released him.
     He made him lord of his household,
         and ruler of all his possessions,
     to admonish his princes at will
         and instruct his elders in wisdom.


     Thus Israel came into Egypt,
         Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham.
     His people he made very fruitful,
         and mightier than their foes.
     He inspired them to hate his people,
         and to deal with his servants craftily.


     He sent his servant Moses,
         and Aaron whom he had chosen,
     portents he wrought in Egypt,
         and signs in the land of Ham.
     Darkness he sent, and it fell:
         yet they gave no heed to his word.


     He turned their waters into blood,
         thus causing their fish to die.
     Their land was alive with frogs,
         swarming even in the royal chambers.
     At his command came flies,
         and lice in all their borders.
     He gave them hail for rain
         and fire that flashed through the land,
     smiting their vines and figs,
         breaking the trees of their border.


     At his command came locusts,
         young locusts beyond all counting,
     which ate every herb in the land,
         ate up, too, the fruit of their ground.
     He struck down in their land all the firstborn,
         the firstlings of all their strength
     Then forth he led Israel with silver and gold,
         and among his tribes no one was weary.


     Egypt was glad when they left,
         for terror had fallen upon them.
     He spread out a cloud to screen them,
         and fire to give light in the night.
     He sent quails at their entreaty,
         and heavenly bread in abundance.
     He opened the rock; waters gushed:
         in the desert they ran like a river.
     For he remembered his holy promise
         to Abraham his servant.


     So he led out his people with joy,
         his elect with a ringing cry.
     And he gave them the lands of the nations,
         the fruit of their toil for possession,
     that so they might keep his statutes,
         and be of his laws observant.
             Hallelujah.

*Psalm 106 -- The Nation's Sin against the Lord*


             Hallelujah!
     Give thanks to the LORD for his goodness,
         for his kindness endures forever.
     Who can describe his heroic deeds,
         or publish all his praise?
     Happy they who act justly,
         and do righteousness evermore.


     Remember me, LORD, as you remember your people,
         and visit me with your gracious help.
     May I see the good fortune of your elect,
         may I share in the joy of your nation,
         and in the pride of your heritage.


     We, like our fathers, have sinned,
         we have done perversely and wickedly
     In the land of Egypt our fathers,
         all heedless of your wonders,
     and unmindful of your great kindness,
         at the Red Sea defied the Most High.
     But true to his name he saved them,
         in order to show his might.
     He rebuked the Red Sea, and it dried;
         they marched through the depths as through desert,
     saved from the hand of the hostile,
         redeemed from the hand of the foe.
     The waters covered their enemies:
         not one of them was left.
     So then they believed in his words,
         and began to sing his praise.


     But soon they forgot his deeds:
         they did not wait for his counsel.
     Their greed was ravenous in the desert;
         they put God to the test in the wilderness.
     He gave them the thing they had asked for,
         but sent wasting disease among them.


     The camp grew jealous of Moses
         and of Aaron, holy one of the LORD.
     The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan,
         and covered Abiram's company.
     Fire broke out on their company,
         flame kindled upon the wicked.


     They made a calf in Horeb,
         and bowed to the molten image.
     They exchanged their glorious God
         for the image of ox that eats grass.
     They forgot the God who had saved them
         by mighty deeds in Egypt
     Wonders in the land of Ham,
         terrors by the Red Sea.
     So he vowed, and would have destroyed them,
         but for Moses his elect,
     who stepped into the breach before him,
         to divert his deadly wrath.


     They spurned the delightsome land,
         they refused to believe in his word.
     They grumbled in their tents,
         would not listen to the voice of the LORD.
     So he swore with uplifted hand
         to lay them low in the wilderness;
     to disperse their seed among heathen,
         to scatter them over the world.


     Then they joined them to Baal of Peor,
         and ate what was offered the dead.
     They provoked him to wrath by their deeds,
         and plague broke out among them.
     Then Phinehas stood between,
         and so the plague was stayed;
     and it was counted to him for righteousness
         unto all generations forever.


     They angered him at the waters of Meribah,
         through them it went ill with Moses.
     They rebelled against his spirit,
         and he uttered speech that was rash.


     They did not destroy the nations,
     as the LORD had commanded them;
         but they mingled with the heathen,
     and learned to do as they did.
         Their idol gods they worshipped,
     and they were ensnared by them.
         They sacrificed their sons
     and their daughters to the demons.
         They poured out innocent blood
     the blood of their sons and daughters
         whom they offered to Canaan's idols,
     and the land was polluted with blood.
         They became unclean by their works,
     and adulterous in their deeds.
         Then the LORD's fury was on his people,
     filled with horror at his inheritance.
         He delivered them to the heathen,
     to the sway of those who hated them.
         Their enemies oppressed them,
     and subdued them under their hand.
         Many a time he saved them,
     but they rebelled at his counsel,
         and were brought low by their wrongdoing.
     Yet he looked upon their distress,
         when he heard their cry.
     He remembered his covenant,
         and, in his great kindness, relented.
     He caused them to be pitied
         by all who carried them captive.


     Save us, O LORD our God,
         and gather us out of the nations,
     to give thanks to your holy name,
         and to make our boast of your praise.




             Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel,
             from everlasting to everlasting.
             And let all the people say 'Amen.'
             Praise the LORD.

                              [Book Five]



*Psalm 107 -- The Song of the Redeemed*


     Give thanks to the LORD for his goodness
         for his kindness endures forever.
     Let this be the song of the ransomed,
         whom the LORD has redeemed from distress,
     gathering them from all lands,
         east, west, north, and south.


     In the wastes of the desert some wandered,
         finding no way to a city inhabited.
     Full of hunger and thirst,
         their spirit failed.
     Then they cried to the LORD in their trouble,
         and he saved them from their distresses,
     guiding them straight on the way,
         till they reached an inhabited city.
     Let them thank the LORD for his kindness,
         for his wonderful deeds for people;
     for the thirsty he satisfies,
         and the hungry he fills with good things.


     Some sat in darkness and gloom
         prisoners in irons and misery,
     for rebelling against God's word,
         and spurning the Most High's counsel.
     Their heart was bowed with toil;
         there was no one to help when they stumbled.
     Then they cried to the LORD in their trouble,
         and he saved them from their distresses.
     Out of darkness and gloom he brought them,
         and burst their chains.
     Let them praise the LORD for his kindness,
         for his wonderful deeds for people.
     For he shattered the gates of bronze,
         and broke bars of iron.


     Some were sick from their wicked ways,
         and suffering because of their sins.
     All manner of food they hated;
         they had come to the gates of death.
     Then they cried to the LORD in their trouble,
         and he saved them from their distresses.
     He sent his word and healed them,
         and delivered their life from the pit.
     Let them praise the LORD for his kindness,
         for his wonderful deeds for people.
     Let them offer to him thankofferings,
         and with joy tell what things he has done.


     Some crossed the sea in ships,
         doing business in great waters.
     They have seen what the LORD can do,
         and his wonderful deeds on the deep.
     At his command rose a tempest,
         which lifted the waves on high.
     Up to heaven they went, down to the depths;
         their courage failed them.
     They staggered and reeled like drunkards;
         all their skills useless.
     Then they cried to the LORD in their trouble,
         and he saved them from their distresses.
     He stilled the storm to a whisper,
         and the waves of the sea were hushed.
     They were glad, because it was quiet;
         they were led to the haven they longed for.
     Let them praise the LORD, for his kindness,
         for his wonderful deeds for people.
     Where the people assemble, extol him,
         and praise him in council of elders.


     He turns streams into a wilderness,
         springs of water into thirsty land,
     fruitful land into a salt waste,
         because of the sin of the people.
     A desert he makes pools of water,
         a land of drought into springs of water.
     He settles the hungry therein,
         they establish a city to live in.
     They sow fields and plant vineyards,
         which furnish a fruitful yield.
     By his blessing they multiply greatly,
         and he lets not their cattle decrease.


     Yet when they are bowed and diminished
         by oppression, misfortune, or sorrow,
     he pours contempt upon princes,
         and on trackless wastes leads them astray
     He lifts the poor out of misery,
         and makes families fruitful as flocks.
     At this sight shall the upright be glad,
         and all wicked mouths shall be stopped.
     Let those who are wise observe this,
         and consider the love of the LORD

*Psalm 108 -- A Prayer for Victory*
     A song. A psalm of David.

     My heart is steadfast, O God,
         my heart is steadfast.
     I would sing, I would make music;
         awake, my soul.
     Awake, harp and lyre;
         I would wake the dawn.
     I would praise you among the peoples, O LORD;
         make music among the nations to you.
     For great to heaven is your love,
         and your faithfulness to the clouds.
     Be exalted, O God, o'er the heavens,
         and your glory o'er all the earth.


     So those you love may be rescued,
         save by your right hand and answer us.
     God did solemnly swear:
         'As victor will I divide Shechem,
     portion out the valley of Succoth.
         Mine is Gilead, mine is Manasseh,
     Ephraim is my helmet,
         Judah my sceptre of rule,
     Moab the pot that I wash in,
         on Edom I hurl my sandal,
         I shout o'er Philistia in triumph.'


     O to be brought to the fortified city!
         O to be led into Edom!
     Have you not spurned us, O God?
         You do not march forth with our armies.


     Grant us help from the foe,
         for human help is worthless.
     With God we shall yet do bravely,
         he himself will tread down our foes.

*Psalm 109 -- A Prayer for the Lord's Help*
     For the leader. Of David, a psalm.

     O God whom I praise, keep not silence;
         for their wicked mouths they have opened against me,
         they speak to me with tongues that are false,
     they beset me with words of hatred,
         and fight without cause against me.
     My love they requite with hostility,
         while for them I lift up my prayer.
     Evil for good they reward me,
         and hatred for my love.


     'Set over him one who is godless,' they say,
         'an opponent at his right hand.
     From his trial let him come forth guilty,
         may his prayer be counted as sin.
     Grant that his days may be few,
         that his office be seized by another.
     Grant that his children be fatherless,
         and that his wife be a widow.
     Up and down may his children go begging,
         expelled from their desolate home.
     May all that he owns be seized by the creditor
         may strangers plunder the fruits of his toil.


     'May none extend to him kindness,
         or pity his fatherless children.
     His descendants be doomed to destruction!
         Blotted out be his name in one generation!
     May his father's guilt be remembered,
         and his mother's sin not blotted out:
     on record always before the LORD,
         and his memory root from the earth;
     for he gave no thought to show kindness,
         but pursued the poor and the needy,
         drove the downhearted to death.


     'May the curses he loved light upon him,
         may the blessings he loathed be afar.
     Like a garment he clothed him with curses;
         may they pierce to his inwards like water,
         and cling to his bones like oil.
     Let them be like the robe he wraps round him,
         like the belt he wears every day.'
     Be this the reward of my adversaries,
         of those who speak evil against me.


     But you, LORD my GOD,
         be true to your name,
             deal kindly with me;
         in your gracious kindness
             save me.
     For I am poor and needy,
         and my heart is wounded within me.
     I am gone like a lengthening shadow,
         I am shaken off like a locust.
     My knees totter from fasting,
         my flesh is shrivelled and spare.
     They heap insults upon me:
         when they see me, they shake their head.


     Help me, O LORD my God,
         and save me in your kindness.
     Teach them that this is your hand,
         and your own doing, O LORD.
     Let them curse, if only you bless.
         Put my assailants to shame,
         and make your servant glad.
     My opponents be clothed with dishonour,
         and wrapped in a robe of shame.


     I give thanks to you, LORD, with loud voice,
         I give praise in the midst of the throng;
     for he stands by the poor, at his right hand,
         to save them from those who condemn them.

*Psalm 110 -- A Promise of Victory to the King*
     Of David, a psalm.

     This said the LORD concerning my lord,
         'Sit at my right hand,
         till I set your foot on the neck of your foes.'


     On Zion the LORD is wielding
         your sceptre of might, and charges you
         to rule over the foes that surround you.


     The day that you march to battle
         your people will follow you gladly
     young warriors in holy array,
         like dew-drops, born of the morning.


     The LORD has sworn and will not repent,
         'As for you, you are priest for ever
         as Melchizedek was.'


     By your side will the LORD shatter kings
         on the day of his wrath.
     He will execute judgment
         filling the valleys with dead,
         the broad fields with shattered heads.
     He will drink of the brook by the way,
         and march onward with uplifted head.

*Psalm 111 -- In Praise of the Divine Goodness*


             Hallelujah.
     I will thank the LORD with all my heart,
         in the assembled congregation of his people.
     Great are the things that the LORD has done,
         worthy of study by those who love them.
     Majestic and glorious is his work,
         and his righteousness abides forever.
     For his marvellous deeds he has won renown;
         the LORD is gracious and full of compassion.
     Food he gives to those who fear him,
         always he remembers his covenant.
     His mighty works he has shown to his people,
         in giving to them the nations for heritage.
     All that he does is faithful and right,
         all his behests are firm and sure.
     They are established for ever and ever,
         executed with truth and uprightness.
     To his people he sent redemption,
         he has appointed his covenant forever.
     His name is holy and awe-inspiring.
         The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom
     those who keep it are wise indeed.
         His praise abides for ever and ever.

*Psalm 112 -- The Blessings of Godliness*


             Hallelujah.Happy are those who fear the LORD,
         and greatly delight in his commandments.
     Mighty on earth shall be their seed;
         a blessing shall rest on the race of the upright.
     Wealth and riches are in their houses,
         their prosperity stands forever.
     To the upright arises light in the darkness;
         full of favour and pity and kindness are they.
     It is well with those who show pity and lend,
         who support all their affairs upon justice.
     For they will never be shaken;
         the just will be forever remembered.
     They will not be afraid of evil tidings,
         with steady heart they trust the LORD.
     Their heart is firm and unafraid:
         they know they will feast their eyes on their enemies.
         With lavish hands they give to the poor,
     and their prosperity stands forever.
         They are lifted to heights of triumph and honour.
     The sight of them fills the wicked with anger:
         grinding their teeth with despair.
         The hopes of the wicked will come to nothing.

*Psalm 113 -- The Lord loves the Humble*


             Hallelujah.
     Praise the LORD, you his servants,
         praise the name of the LORD.
     The name of the LORD be blessed
         from now and for evermore.
     From sunrise to sunset
         is the name of the LORD to be praised.


     High is the LORD above all nations,
         above the heavens is his glory.
     Who is like the LORD our God,
         seated on high?
     He bends down to look
         at the heavens and earth.


     He raises the weak from the dust,
         he lifts the poor from the dunghill,
     and sets them beside the princes,
         even the princes of his people.
     He gives the childless woman a home,
         and makes her the happy mother of children.
             Hallelujah.

*Psalm 114 -- The Marvel of the Exodus*


     When Israel went out of Egypt,
         Jacob's house from a barbarous people,
     God chose Judah for himself,
         Israel became his kingdom.


     The sea saw it, and fled,
         Jordan river ran backwards.
     Mountains skipped like rams,
         hills like the young of the flock.


     Why, sea, do you flee?
         Jordan, why run backwards?
     Mountains, why skip ram-like?
         Why, hills, like the young of the flock?


     Earth, tremble before the LORD,
         at the presence of Jacob's God,
     who turns rocks into pools of water,
         and flint into fountains of water.

*Psalm 115 -- Israel's Incomparable God*


     Not to us, LORD, not to us,
         but to your name give glory,
         for your kindness' and faithfulness' sake.
     Why should the heathen say,
         'Where is now their God?'
     Our God he is in heaven;
         whatever he wishes, he does.
     Their idols are silver and gold,
         made by human hands.
     They have mouths, but cannot speak;
         they have eyes, but cannot see.
     They have ears, but cannot hear;
         they have noses, but cannot smell.
     They have hands, but cannot feel;
         they have feet, but cannot walk:
         no sound comes from their throats.
     Their makers become like them,
         so do all who trust in them.


     O Israel, trust in the LORD:
         he is their help and their shield.
     House of Aaron, trust in the LORD:
         he is their help and their shield.
     You who fear the LORD, trust in the LORD
         he is their help and their shield.


     The LORD, mindful of us, will bless us:
         he will bless the house of Israel,
         he will bless the house of Aaron.
     He will bless those who fear the LORD,
         the small and the great together.


     May the LORD add to your numbers
         to you and to your children.
     Blessed be you of the LORD,
         creator of heaven and earth.


     The heavens are the heavens of the LORD,
         but the earth has he given to people.
     The dead cannot praise the LORD,
         nor those who go down into silence.
     But we will bless the LORD
         from now and for evermore.
             Hallelujah.

*Psalm 116 -- Song of Thanksgiving for Deliverance*


     I love the LORD, for he hears
         my voice, my pleas for mercy.
     For he has inclined his ear to me:
         I will call upon him as long as I live.


     About me were snares of death,
         the anguish of Sheol was upon me:
         distress and sorrow were mine.
     Then I called on the name of the LORD:
         'I beseech you, O LORD, deliver me.'


     Gracious and just is the LORD,
         compassionate is our God.
     The LORD preserves the simple;
         when I was drooping, he saved me.
     Be at peace, my heart, once more,
         for the LORD has been good to you.


     You have rescued me from death,
         my eyes from tears,
         my feet from stumbling.
     Before the LORD I will walk
         in the land of the living.


     I held fast my faith, though I said,
         'Ah me! I am sore afflicted,'
     though in my alarm I said,
         'Everyone is a liar.'


     What shall I render the LORD
         for all his bounty to me?
     I will lift up the cup of salvation,
         and call on the name of the LORD.
     I will pay my vows to the LORD
         in the presence of all his people.


     Grave in the eyes of the LORD
         is the death of his loyal and loved ones.
     Ah, LORD! I am your servant,
         your servant, child of your handmaid.
         You have loosened my bonds.


     I will offer to you a thank-offering,
         and call on the name of the LORD.
     I will pay my vows to the LORD
         in the presence of all his people,
     in the courts of the house of the LORD,
         in the midst of you, O Jerusalem.
             Hallelujah.

*Psalm 117 -- A Call to Praise*


     Praise the LORD, all you nations:
         laud him, all you peoples.
     For his mighty love is over us:
         the LORD is faithful forever.
             Hallelujah.

*Psalm 118 -- Thanksgiving for Victory*


     Give thanks to the LORD for his goodness,
         his kindness endures forever.
     Let the house of Israel now say:
         his kindness endures forever.
     Let the house of Aaron now say:
         his kindness endures forever.
     Let those who fear the LORD now say:
         his kindness endures forever.


     Out of straits I called on the LORD,
         the LORD answered and gave me room.
     The LORD is mine; I am fearless.
         What can mere people do to me?
     The LORD is mine, as my help:
         I shall feast my eyes on my foes.
     It is better to hide in the LORD
         than to trust in mortals.
     It is better to hide in the LORD
         than to put any trust in princes.
     Everywhere heathen swarmed round me;
         in the name of the LORD I cut them down.
     They swarmed, swarmed around me;
         in the name of the LORD I cut them down,
     they swarmed around me like bees,
         they blazed like a fire of thorns:
         in the name of the LORD I cut them down.


     Sore they pushed me, to make me fall;
         but the LORD gave me his help.
     The LORD is my strength and my song,
         and he is become my salvation.
     Hark! In the tents of the righteous
         glad cries of victory are ringing.
     The hand of the LORD has wrought bravely,
         the hand of the LORD is exalted,
         the hand of the LORD has wrought bravely.


     I shall not die: nay, I shall live,
         to declare the works of the LORD.
     Though the LORD has chastened me sore,
         he has not given me over to death.


     (The Procession arrives at the Temple)


     'Open to me the gates of victory.
     I would enter therein and give thanks to the LORD.'


     (The Welcome)


     'This is the gate of the LORD:
     the righteous may enter therein;'


     I thank you because you have heard me,
         and are become my salvation.


     The stone which the builders despised
         is become the head-stone of the corner.
     This has been wrought by the LORD;
         it is marvellous in our eyes.


     This day is the LORD's own creation:
         in it let us joy and be glad.
     O LORD, save us, we pray,
         O LORD, prosper, we pray.


     Blessed the one who enters
         in the name of the LORD.
     From the house of the LORD we bless you.
     The LORD is God,
         he has given us light.
     Wreathe the dance with boughs,
         till they touch the horns of the altar.
     You are my God, I will thank you;
         O my God, I will exalt you.
     Give thanks to the LORD for his goodness:
         his kindness endures forever.

*Psalm 119 -- The Power and Comfort of the Word of God*


     Happy they whose life is blameless,
         who walk by the law of the LORD.
     Happy they who keep his charges,
         and seek him with all their hearts;
     who have done no wrong,
         but walk in his ways.
     You yourself have appointed your precepts
         to be kept with diligence.


     O to be steadily guided
         in the keeping of your statutes!
     Then unashamed shall I be,
         when I look towards all your commandments.
     I will thank you with heart unfeigned,
         when I learn your righteous judgments.
     I will observe your statutes:
         O forsake me not utterly.


     How can a young person keep their life pure?
         By giving heed to your word.
     With all my heart have I sought you,
         let me not stray from your commandments.
     In my heart have I treasured your word,
         to keep from sinning against you.
     Blessed are you, O LORD;
         teach me your statutes.
     With my lips have I rehearsed
         all the judgments of your mouth.
     I delight in the way of your charges,
         more than in riches of all sorts.
     I will muse upon your precepts,
         and look to your paths.
     In your statutes I delight,
         I will not forget your word.


     Grant that your servant may live,
         and I will observe your word.
     Open my eyes, that I see
         wondrous things out of your law.
     But a guest am I on the earth:
         hide not your commandments from me.
     My heart is crushed with longing
         for your ordinances, at all times.
     You rebuke the proud, the accursed,
         who wander from your commandments.
     Roll away from me scorn and contempt,
         for I have observed your charges.
     Though princes sit plotting against me,
         your servant will muse on your statutes.
     Your charges are my delight,
         they are my counsellors.


     I lie grovelling in the dust;
         revive me, as you have promised.
     I told of my ways, you made answer;
         teach me your statutes.
     Grant me insight into your precepts,
         and I will muse on your wonders.
     I am overcome with sorrow;
         raise me up, as you have promised.
     Put the way of falsehood from me,
         and graciously grant me your law.
     I have chosen the way of fidelity,
         your ordinances I long for.
     I hold fast to your charges:
         O put me not, LORD, to shame.
     I will run in the way of your commandments,
         for you give me room of heart.


     Teach me, O LORD, the way of your statutes,
         and I will keep it to the end,
     instruct me to keep your law,
         and I will observe it with all my heart.
     Guide me in the path of your commandments,
         for therein do I delight.
     Incline my heart to your charges,
         and not to greed of gain.
     Turn away my eyes from vain sights,
         revive me by your word.
     Confirm to your servant the promise
         which is given to those who fear you.
     Remove the reproach which I dread,
         because your judgments are good.
     Behold, I long for your precepts.
         Quicken me in your righteousness.


     Visit me, LORD, with your love
         and salvation, as you have promised.
     So shall I answer my slanderers,
         for my trust is in your word.
     Snatch not from my mouth the word of truth,
         for in your judgments I hope.
     I will keep your law continually,
         for ever and evermore.
     So shall I walk in wide spaces,
         for I give my mind to your precepts.
     I will speak of your charge before kings,
         and will not be ashamed thereof.
     Your commandments are my delight,
         I love them exceedingly.
     I will lift up my hands to your commandments,
         and muse upon your statutes.


     Remember your word to your servant,
         on which you have made me to hope.
     This is my comfort in trouble,
         that your word gives life to me.
     The arrogant utterly scorn me,
         but I have not declined from your law.
     When I think of your judgments of old,
         O LORD, I take to me comfort.
     I am seized with glowing anger
         at the wicked who forsake your law.
     Your statutes have been to me songs
         in the house of my pilgrimage.
     I remember your name in the night,
         O LORD and observe your law.
     My lot has been this,
         that I have kept your precepts.


     My portion are you, O LORD:
         I have promised to keep your words.
     I entreat you with all my heart;
         grant me your promised favour.
     I have thought upon my ways,
         and turned my feet to your charges.
     I hasted and tarried not
         to give heed to your commandments.
     Though the godless have wound their cords round me,
         I have not forgotten your law.
     At midnight I rise to praise you
         because of your righteous judgments.
     With all those who fear you I company,
         aid with those who observe your precepts.
     The earth, LORD, is full of your kindness;
         teach me your Statutes.


     Well have you dealt with your servant,
         as you have promised, O LORD.
     Teach me discretion and knowledge,
         for I have believed your commandments.
     Till trouble came I was a wanderer,
         but now I observe your word.
     You are good and do good;
         teach me your statutes.
     The proud have forged lies against me,
         but I keep your precepts with all my heart.
     Their heart is gross like fat,
         but I delight in your law.
     It was good for me to be humbled,
         that I should learn your statutes.
     The law of your mouth is better to me
         than thousands of pieces of silver and gold.


     Your hands have made me and fashioned me;
         make me wise to learn your commandments.
     Those who fear you shall see me with joy,
         for in your word have I hoped.
     I know, O LORD, that your judgments are right,
         and in faithfulness you have afflicted me.
     Let your love be a comfort to me,
         for so have you promised your servant.
     Visit me with your quickening pity,
         for your law is my delight.
     Put the proud to shame, who have wronged me falsely:
         I will muse on your precepts.
     Let those turn to me who fear you,
         that they may learn your charges.
     Let my heart be sound in your statutes,
         that I may not be put to shame.


     My long for you to rescue me,
         I put my hope in your word.
     My eyes pine away for your promise:
         saying, 'When will you comfort me?'
     Though shrivelled like wine-skin in smoke,
         your statutes I have not forgotten.
     How few are the days of your servant!
         When will you judge those who harass me?
     Proud people have dug for me pits
         people who do not conform to your law.
     All your commandments are trusty.
         With falsehood they harass me: help me.
     They had nearly made an end of me,
         yet I did not forget your precepts.
     Spare me in your kindness,
         and I will observe the charge of your mouth.


     Forever, O LORD, is your word
         fixed firmly in the heavens.
     Your truth endures age after age;
         it is established on earth, and it stands.
     By your appointment they stand this day,
         for all are your servants.
     Had not your law been my joy,
         in my misery then had I perished.
     I will never forget your precepts,
         for through them you have put life in me.
     I am yours, O save me,
         for I give my mind to your precepts.
     The wicked lay wait to destroy me,
         but I give heed to your charge.
     I have seen a limit to all things:
         but your commandment is spacious exceedingly.


     O how I love your law!
         All the day long I muse on it.
     Your commandment makes me wiser than my enemies:
         for it is mine forever.
     I am prudent above all my teachers,
         for your charges are my meditation.
     I have insight more than the aged,
         because I observe your precepts.
     I refrain my foot from all wicked ways,
         that I may keep your word.
     I turn not aside from your judgments,
         for you yourself are my teacher.
     How sweet are your words to my taste,
         sweeter than honey to my mouth!
     Insight I win through your precepts,
         therefore every false way I hate.


     Your word is a lamp to my feet,
         and a light to my path.
     I have sworn an oath, and will keep it,
         to observe your righteous judgments.
     I am afflicted sorely:
         revive me, O LORD, as you said.
     Accept, LORD, my willing praise,
         and teach me your judgments.
     My life is in ceaseless peril;
         but I do not forget your law.
     The wicked set traps for me,
         yet I do not stray from your precepts.
     In your charges are my everlasting inheritance,
         they are the joy of my heart.
     I am resolved to perform your statutes
         forever, to the utmost.


     I hate people of divided heart,
         but your law do I love.
     You are my shelter and shield:
         in your word do I hope.
     Begone, you wicked people,
         I will keep the commands of my God.
     Uphold me and spare me, as you have promised:
         O disappoint me not.
     Hold me up, and I shall be saved:
         and your statutes shall be my unceasing delight.
     All who swerve from your statutes you spurn:
         their cunning is in vain.
     All the wicked of earth you count as dross,
         therefore I love your charges.
     My flesh, for fear of you, shudders,
         and I stand in awe of your judgments.


     Justice and right have I practised,
         do not leave me to my oppressors.
     Be your servant's surety for good,
         let not the proud oppress me.
     My eyes pine for your salvation,
         and for your righteous promise.
     Deal in your love with your servant,
         and teach me your statutes.
     Your servant am I; instruct me,
         that I may know your charges.
     It is time for the LORD to act:
         they have violated your law.
     Therefore I love your commandments
         above gold, above fine gold.
     So by all your precepts I guide me,
         and every false way I hate.


     Your decrees are wonderful,
         gladly I keep them.
     When your word is unfolded, light breaks;
         it imparts to the simple wisdom.
     With open mouth I pant
         with longing for your commandments.
     Turn to me with your favour,
         as is just to those who love you.
     Steady my steps by your word,
         so that sin have no power over me.
     Set me free from those who oppress me,
         and I shall observe your precepts.
     Shine with your face on your servant,
         and teach me your statutes.
     My eyes run down with rills of water,
         because your law is not kept.


     Righteous are you, O LORD,
         and right are your ordinances.
     The laws you has ordered are just,
         and trusty exceedingly.
     My jealousy has undone me,
         that my foes have forgotten your words.
     Your word has been tested well;
         and your servant loves it.
     I am little and held in contempt,
         but your precepts I have not forgotten.
     Just is your justice forever,
         and trusty is your law.
     Stress and strain are upon me,
         but your commandments are my delight.
     Right are your charges forever,
         instruct me that I may live.


     With my whole heart I cry; O answer me.
         I would keep your statutes, O LORD.
     I cry to you: O save me,
         and I will observe your charges.
     Before dawn I cry for your help:
         in your word do I hope.
     Awake I meet the night-watches,
         to muse upon your sayings.
     Hear my voice in your kindness:
         O LORD, by your judgments revive me.
     Near me are wicked tormentors,
         who are far from thoughts of your law;
     but near, too, are you, O LORD,
         and all your commandments are trusty.
     Long have I known from your charges
         that you have founded them for all time.


     Look on my misery, and rescue me;
         for I do not forget your law.
     Defend my cause and redeem me:
         revive me, as you have promised.
     Salvation is far from the wicked,
         for their mind is not in your statutes.
     Great is your pity, O LORD:
         Revive me, as you have ordained.
     My foes and tormentors are many,
         but I have not declined from your charges.
     I behold the traitors with loathing,
         for they do not observe your word.
     Behold how I love your precepts:
         revive me, O LORD!, in your kindness.
     The sum of your word is truth,
         all your laws are just and eternal.


     Princes have harassed me wantonly:
         but my heart stands in awe of your word.
     Over your word I rejoice
         as one who finds great spoil.
     Falsehood I hate and abhor,
         but your law do I love.
     Seven times a day do I praise you
         because of your righteous judgments.
     Right well do they fare who love your law:
         they go on their way without stumbling.
     I hope for your salvation;
         O LORD I do your commandments.
     I observe your charges:
         I love them greatly.
     I observe your precepts and charges:
         all my ways are before you.


     Let my cry come before you, O LORD:
         give me insight, as you have promised.
     Let my prayer enter into your presence:
         deliver me, as you have said.
     My lips shall be fountains of praise,
         that you teach me your statutes.
     My tongue shall sing of your word,
         for all your commandments are right.
     Let your hand be ready to help me,
         for your precepts have been my choice.
     I long, LORD, for your salvation,
         and your law is my delight.
     Revive me that I may praise you,
         and let your precepts help me.
     I have strayed like a wandering sheep
         seek your servant, because
         I do not forget your commandments.

*Psalm 120 -- Prayer for Deliverance from Slander and Treachery*
     A song of ascents.

     In distress I cried to the LORD,
         and he answered me.
     'Deliver me, LORD,
         from the lip that is false
         and the tongue that is crafty.'


     What shall he give to you,
         you tongue that is crafty?
     What yet shall he give to you?
     Arrows of warrior, sharpened,
         with glowing broom coals together.


     Woe is me that I sojourn in Meshech,
         that I live by the tents of Kedar.
     Already too long have I dwelt
         among those who hate peace.
     I am for peace:
         but when I speak of it,
         they are for war.

*Psalm 121 -- The Lord Our Protector*
     A song of ascents.

     I lift up my eyes to the mountains.
         From where will help for me come?
     My help will come from the LORD
         the creator of heaven and earth.


     Your foot he will not let stumble:
         he who guards you will not sleep.
     He who watches over Israel
         will neither slumber nor sleep.


     The LORD himself protects you,
         is your shelter beside you.
     The sun by day will not strike you,
         nor the moon by night.


     From all harm the LORD will guard you,
         will watch over your life.
     The LORD will guard your going and coming
         from now and for evermore.

*Psalm 122 -- The Joy and the Prayer of the Pilgrims*
     A song of ascents. Of David.

     I was glad when they said to me,
         'We will go to the house of the LORD.'
     Now we are standing,
         within your gates, O Jerusalem.


     O Jerusalem, built close-packed,
         like a city without breach or gap,
     to you do the tribes come,
         the tribes of the LORD,
     as the law has ordained for Israel,
         there to give thanks to the LORD.
     There once stood thrones of justice
         even thrones of the household of David.


     Pray that all may be well with Jerusalem,
         and well with those who love you,
     well within your ramparts,
         and well within your palaces.


     For the sake of my brethren and friends,
         I will wish you now prosperity:
     for the sake of the house of the LORD
         our God, I will seek your good.

*Psalm 123 -- A Prayer for Mercy*
     A song of ascents.

     I Lift up my eyes to you,
         who are throned in the heavens.
     As the eyes of a servant
         turn to the hand of his master,
     or the eyes of a maid
         to the hand of her mistress,
     so do our eyes turn
         to the LORD our God,
     until he is gracious to us.


     Be gracious, be gracious to us, LORD.
         Scorn enough, and more, have we borne
     More than enough have we borne
         of derision from those at their ease,
         of scorn from those who are haughty.

*Psalm 124 -- A Magnificent Deliverance*
     A song of ascents. Of David.

     'Had it not been the LORD who was for us'
         let Israel say
     'Had it not been the LORD who was for us
     when enemies rose against us,
     then alive they'd have swallowed us up,
         when their anger was kindled against us.
     Then the waters would've swept us away,
         and the torrent passed over us clean:
     then most sure would've passed over us clean
         the wild seething waters.'


     Blest be the LORD who has given us not
         to be torn by their teeth.
     We are like a bird just escaped
         from the snare of the fowler.


     The snare is broken,
         and we are escaped.
     Our help is the name of the LORD,
         the Creator of heaven and earth.

*Psalm 125 -- A Sure Defence*
     A song of ascents.

     Those who trust in the LORD
         are like Mount Zion,
     that cannot be moved,
         but abides forever.
     Round Jerusalem are the mountains,
         and the LORD is round his people
         from now and for evermore.


     For he will not suffer
         the sceptre of wrong
     to rest on the land
         allotted to the righteous;
     else the righteous might put forth
         their own hand to evil.


     Do good, O LORD,
         to the good,
         and to the true-hearted.


     But those who swerve
         into crooked ways
     will the LORD lead away
         with the workers of evil.


             Peace be upon Israel.

*Psalm 126 -- Sowing in Tears*
     A song of ascents.

     When the LORD turned the fortunes of Zion,
         we were like dreamers.
     Then was our mouth filled with laughter,
         our tongue with glad shouts;
     then among the nations they said,
         'The LORD has dealt greatly with them.'
     The LORD had dealt greatly with us,
         and we were rejoicing.


     Turn our fortunes, O LORD,
         as the streams in the Negreb.
     They who sow in tears
         shall reap with glad shouts.
     Forth they fare, with their burden of seed,
         and they weep as they go.
     But home, home, with glad shouts they shall come
         with their arms full of sheaves.

*Psalm 127 -- The Need of Heavenly Help*
     A song of ascents. Of Solomon.

     Unless the LORD builds the house,
         those who build it labour in vain.
     Unless the LORD guards the city,
         the watchman wakes in vain.


     In vain you rise early,
         and finish so late,
         and so eat sorrow's bread;
     for he cares for his loved ones
         in their sleep.


     Children are a gift of the LORD,
         the fruit of the womb, a reward.
     Like arrows wielded by warriors,
         are the children of youth.


     Happy the man who has filled
         his quiver full of them.
     He will not be ashamed when he speaks
         with enemies in the gate.

*Psalm 128 -- The Blessings of Home*
     A song of ascents.

     Happy all who fear the LORD,
         who walk in his ways.
     You will eat what your hands have toiled for,
         and be happy and prosperous!


     Like a fruitful vine shall your wife be
         in the innermost room of your house:
     your children, like olive shoots,
         round about your table.


     See! This is the blessing
         of the man who fears the LORD.
     The LORD shall bless you from Zion.
         You will see Jerusalem nourish
     all the days of your life.
         You will see your children's children.


             Peace upon Israel.

*Psalm 129 -- A Prayer for the Discomfiture of the Enemies of Zion*
     A song of ascents.

     'Sore have they vexed me from youth'
         thus let Israel say
     'Sore have they vexed me from youth,
         but they have not prevailed against me.


     'The ploughers ploughed on my back,
         they made their furrows long.
     But the LORD, who is righteous, has cut
         the cords of the wicked.'


     Let all who are haters of Zion
         be put to shame and defeated.
     May they be as the grass on the house-top,
         which withers before it shoots up;


     which fills not the arms of the reaper,
         nor the lap of the binder of sheaves
     whereof no one says as they pass,
         'The blessing of God be upon you.'


             In the name of the LORD we bless you.

*Psalm 130 -- Out of the Depths*
     A song of ascents.

     Out of the depths
         I call to you, LORD.
     LORD, hear my voice:
         give heed with your ears
         to my loud plea.


     If you should mark sin, LORD,
         O LORD, who could stand?
     But with you is forgiveness,
         that you may be feared.


     I wait for the LORD,
         I wait for his word,
     I look for the LORD
         more than watchman for morning,
         than watchman for morning.


     Israel, hope in the LORD:
         with the LORD there is love
     with him plenteous redemption.
     And he redeems Israel
         from all his iniquities.

*Psalm 131 -- As a Little Child*
     A song of ascents. Of David.

     O LORD, my heart is not haughty,
         my eyes are not lofty,
     I walk not among great things,
         things too wonderful for me.


     Yes, I have soothed and stilled myself,
         like a young child on his mother's lap;
         like a young child am I.


     O Israel, hope in the LORD
         from now and for evermore.

*Psalm 132 -- The Ancient Promise to David and Zion*
     A song of ascents.

     Remember, O LORD, David
         all his sufferings,
     the oath that he swore to the LORD,
         and his vow to the Strong One of Jacob,
     never to enter his tent,
         never to lie on his bed,
     never to give his eyes sleep
         or his eyelids slumber,
     till he had found a place for the LORD,
         for the Strong One of Jacob to live in.


     We heard of it in Ephrathah,
         in the fields of Jaar we found it.
     We went to the place where he dwelt,
         we bowed ourselves low at his footstool.
     'Arise, LORD, and enter your resting-place,
         you and your mighty ark.
     Let your priests wear a garment of righteousness,
         your faithful shout aloud for joy.
     For the sake of David your servant,
         do not reject your Anointed.'


     The LORD swore an oath to David
         an oath that he will not break;
     'I will set on your throne
         a prince of your line.
     If your sons keep my covenant
         and the statutes I teach them,
     then their sons, too, forever,
         will sit on your throne.'
     For the choice of the LORD is Zion;
         she is the home of his heart.


     'This is forever my resting-place,
         this is the home of my heart.
     I will royally bless her provision,
         and give bread to her poor in abundance.
     Her priests I will clothe with salvation;
         her faithful will shout for joy.
     There will I raise up for David
         a dynasty of power.
     I have set my anointed a lamp
         that shall never go out.
     Robes of shame I will put on his foes,
         but on his head a glittering crown.'

*Psalm 133 -- Family together*
     A song of ascents. Of David.

     Behold! How good and how pleasant
         is the dwelling of kindred together!
     Like precious oil on the head
         that ran down on the beard,
     the beard of Aaron, running
         over the collar of his robe:
     like the dew upon Hermon which falls
         on the mountains of Zion.
     For there has the LORD ordained blessing --
         life that is endless.

*Psalm 134 -- An Evening Invocation*
     A song of ascents.

     Come, praise the LORD,
         all you the LORD's servants,
     who stand by night
         in the house of the LORD.
     Lift your hands to the holy place,
         praise the LORD.


     The LORD who made heaven and earth,
         bless you from Zion.

*Psalm 135 -- The Lord's Power Revealed in Nature and History*


             Hallelujah.
     Praise the name of the LORD.
         Praise the LORD, you his servants,
     who stand in the house of the LORD,
         in the courts of the house of our God.
     Praise the LORD, for the LORD is good:
         Sing praise to his name it is pleasant.
     The LORD for himself chose Jacob,
         Israel as his own special treasure.


     For I know that the LORD is great,
         that our LORD is above all gods.
     All that he wills he does
         in the heavens and on the earth,
         in the seas and in all the abysses.
     Clouds he brings up from the ends of the earth,
         lightnings he makes for the rain,
         wind he brings out of his storehouses.


     The firstborn of Egypt he struck,
         both humans and animals.
     Signs and wonders he sent
         into your midst, O Egypt,
         upon Pharaoh and all his servants.
     Many nations he struck,
         mighty kings he slew
     Sihon, king of the Amorites,
         Og, king of Bashan,
         and all the kingdoms of Canaan.
     He gave their land for possession,
         possession to Israel his people.


     Your name, O LORD, is forever;
         your memorial world without end.
     For the LORD secures right for his people,
         and takes pity upon his servants.


     The idols of heathen are silver
         made by human hands.
     They have mouths, but cannot speak:
         they have eyes, but cannot see.
     They have ears, but cannot hear:
         there is no breath in their mouths.
     Their makers become like them,
         so do all who trust in them.


     House of Israel, praise the LORD:
         house of Araon, praise the LORD.
     House of Levi, praise the LORD:
         you who fear the LORD, praise the LORD.
     Blest be the LORD out of Zion,
         who lives in Jerusalem.
             Hallelujah.

*Psalm 136 -- The Lord's Love Revealed in Nature and History*


     Give thanks to the LORD for his goodness:
         for his kindness endures forever.
     Give thanks to the God of gods:
         for his kindness endures forever.
     Give thanks to the Lord of lords:
         for his kindness endures forever.


     To him who alone does great wonders:
         for his kindness endures forever.
     Whose wisdom created the heavens:
         for his kindness endures forever.
     Who spread forth the earth on the waters:
         for his kindness endures forever.
     Who made great lights:
         for his kindness endures forever.
     The sun to rule over the day:
         for his kindness endures forever.
     Moon and stars to rule over the night:
         for his kindness endures forever.


     Who struck the firstborn of Egypt:
         for his kindness endures forever.
     And brought Israel out from their midst:
         for his kindness endures forever.
     With strong hand and outstretched arm:
         for his kindness endures forever.
     Who cut the Red Sea in pieces:
         for his kindness endures forever.
     And brought Israel right through the midst:
         for his kindness endures forever.
     And shook Pharaoh with all his host into the sea
         for his kindness endures forever.


     Who led his people through the desert:
         for his kindness endures forever.
     Who struck down great kings:
         for his kindness endures forever.
     And slew noble kings:
         for his kindness endures forever.
     Sihon, king of the Amorites:
         for his kindness endures forever.
     And Og, king of Bashan:
         for his kindness endures forever.
     Who gave their land for possession:
         for his kindness endures forever.
     Possession to Israel his servant:
         for his kindness endures forever.


     Who remembered our low estate:
         for his kindness endures forever.
     And rescued us from our foes:
         for his kindness endures forever.
     Who gives to all flesh food:
         for his kindness endures forever.
     Give thanks to the God of heaven:
         for his kindness endures forever.

*Psalm 137 -- By the Waters of Babylon*


     By the waters of Babylon there we sat,
         and we wept at the thought of Zion.
     There on the poplars we hung our harps.
         For there our captors called for a song:
     our tormentors, rejoicing, saying:
         'Sing us one of the songs of Zion.'


     How can we sing the LORD's song
         in the foreigner's land?
     If I forget you, Jerusalem,
         may my right hand wither.
         May my tongue stick to the roof of my mouth,
     if I am unmindful of you,
         or don't set Jerusalem
         above my chief joy.


     Remember the Edomites, LORD,
         the day of Jerusalem's fall,
     when they said, 'Lay her bare, lay her bare,
         right down to her very foundation.'


     Babylon, despoiler,
         happy are those who pay you back
         for all you have done to us.
     Happy are they who seize and dash
         your children against the rocks.

*Psalm 138 -- The Constancy of the Lord's Care*
     Of David.

     I will thank you, O LORD, with all my heart:
         in the sight of the gods I will sing your praise,
     and prostrate before your holy temple,
         will praise your name for your constant love,
         for you have exulted your promise above all.


     When I called you, you answered;
         you gave me strength, you inspired me.
     All the kings of the earth shall praise you, O LORD,
         when they shall have heard the words you have uttered;
     and they shall sing of the ways of the LORD,
         and tell of the LORD's transcendent glory.
     For, high though the LORD is, he looks on the lowly,
         and strikes down the haughty from far away.


     Though my way be distressful, yet you preserve me:
         you lay your hand on my angry foes,
         and your right hand gives me victory.
     The LORD will accomplish all that which concerns me.
         Your kindness, O LORD, endures forever.
         O do not abandon the work of your hands.

*Psalm 139 -- The Ever-Present God*
     For the leader. Of David, a psalm.

     O LORD, you search and know me;
         when I sit, when I rise you know it,
     you perceive my thoughts from afar.


     When I walk, when I lie you sift it,
         familiar with all my ways.
     There is not a word on my tongue,
         but see! LORD, you know it all.


     Behind and before you beset me,
         upon me you lay your hand.
     It's too wonderful for me to know
         too lofty I cannot attain it.


     Whither shall I go from your spirit?
         Or whither shall I flee from your face?
     If I climb up to heaven, you are there:
         or make Sheol my bed, you are there.


     If I lift up the wings of the morning
         and fly to the end of the sea,
     there also your hand would grasp me,
         and your right hand take hold of me.


     If I say, 'Let the darkness cover me,
         and night be the light about me,'
     The dark is not dark for you,
         but night is as light as the day.


     For you did put me together;
         in my mother's womb you did weave me.
     I give you praise for my fashioning
         so full of awe, so wonderful.
         Your works are wonderful.


     You knew me right well;
         my bones were not hidden from you,
     when I was made in secret,
         and woven in the depths of the earth.


     Your eyes saw all my days:
         they stood on your book every one
     written down, before they were fashioned,
         while none of them yet was mine.


     But how far, O God, beyond measure
         are your thoughts! How mighty their sum!
     Should I count, they are more than the sand.
         When I wake, I am still with you.


     Will you slay the wicked, O God?
         And remove from me the bloodthirsty,
     who maliciously defy you
         and take your name in vain.


     Do I not hate those who hate you, LORD?
         Do I not loathe those who resist you?
     With perfect hatred I hate them,
         I count them my enemies.


     Search me, O God, know my heart:
         test me, and know my thoughts,
     and see if guile be in me;
         and lead me in the way everlasting.

*Psalm 140 -- A Prayer for Preservation*
     To the leader. A Psalm of David.

     Rescue me, LORD, from evil people;
         from the violent guard me
     from those who plot evil in their heart,
         and stir up war continually:
     who make their tongue as sharp as a serpent's,
         and under whose lips is the poison of adders. Selah


     Preserve me, O LORD, from the hands of the wicked,
         from the violent guard me
         from those who are plotting to trip up my feet.
     The proud have hidden a trap for me,
         cords they have spread as a net for my feet:
         snares they have set at the side of my track. Selah


     I have said to the LORD, 'My God are you;
         attend, LORD, to my loud plea.
     O LORD my LORD, my saviour mighty,
         you did cover my head in the day of battle.
     Grant not, O LORD, the desires of the wicked;
         and what they have purposed, promote you not.' Selah


     Let them not lift up their heads against me.
         May the mischief they prate bring themselves to destruction,
     may he rain upon them coals of fire,
         may he strike them down swiftly, to rise no more,
     no place in the land may there be for the slanderer:
         may the violent be hunted from sorrow to sorrow.


     I know that the LORD will do right by the weak,
         and will execute justice for those who are needy.
     Surely the righteous shall praise your name,
         and they who are upright shall live in your presence.

*Psalm 141 -- A Prayer for Protection from Persecutors*
     A psalm of David.

     LORD, I call to you: hasten, to me,
         attend to my voice, when I call to you.
     Let my prayer be presented as incense before you,
         and my uplifted hands as the evening meal-offering.


     Set, O LORD, a watch on my mouth,
         put a guard on the door of my lips.
     Incline not my heart to an evil matter,
         to busy myself in deeds of wickedness,
     in company with workers of evil:
         never may I partake of their dainties.


     A wound or reproof from a good person in kindness
         is oil which my head shall never refuse.
         In their misfortune my prayer is still with them.


     Abandoned they are to the hands of their judges:
         they shall learn that my words are true.


     Like stones on a country road cleft and broken
         so lie our bones scattered for Death to devour.
     But my eyes are turned towards you, O LORD.
         Do not pour out my life, for in you I take refuge.
     Keep me safe from the trap they have laid for me,
         from the snares of the workers of trouble.
     Into their own nets let wicked people fall;
         while I pass by in safety.

*Psalm 142 -- A Prayer for Deliverance from Persecutors*
     A maskil of David, while he was in the cave, a prayer.

     Loudly I cry to the LORD:
         to the LORD plead loudly for mercy,
     I pour my complaint before him,
         I tell my troubles to him.


     When my spirit is faint within me,
         my path is known to you.
     In the way I am wont to walk in,
         they have hidden a trap for me.


     I look to the right and the left;
         but not a friend have I.
     No place of refuge is left me,
         not a man to care for me.


     So I cry to you, O LORD:
         I say, 'My refuge are you,
         all I have in the land of the living.'


     Attend to my piercing cry,
         for very weak am I.
     Save me from those who pursue me,
         for they are too strong for me.


     Free me from prison,
         that I may give thanks to your name,
     for the righteous are patiently waiting
         till you show your bounty to me.

*Psalm 143 -- A Prayer for Deliverance and Guidance*
     A psalm of David.

     Listen, O LORD, to my prayer;
         attend to my plea.
     In your faithfulness give me answer,
         and in your righteousness.
     With your servant O enter you not into judgment,
         for in your sight can no one alive be justified.


     For the enemy persecutes me,
         crushing my life to the ground,
     making me live in the darkness,
         as those who have long been dead.
     My spirit is faint within me,
         my heart is bewildered within me.


     I remember the days of old,
         and brood over all you have done,
     musing on all that your hands have wrought.
         I spread out my hands to you:
     I thirst for you,
         like parched earth. Selah


     Answer me soon, LORD,
         because my spirit is spent.
     Hide not your face from me,
         else become I like those who go down to the pit.
     Let me learn of your love in the morning,
         for my trust is in you.
     Teach me the way I should go:
         for my heart longs for you.


     Save me, O LORD, from my foes:
         for to you I have fled for refuge.
     Teach me to do your will,
         for you yourself are my God.
     Guide me by your good spirit,
         O LORD, on a way that is smooth.


     Be true to your name LORD, spare me,
         bring me out of distress in your faithfulness.
     In your kindness extinguish my enemies,
         and all those who vex me destroy;
         for I am your servant.

*Psalm 144 -- The Warrior's Song*
     Of David.

     Blest be the LORD my rock,
         who trains my hands for war,
         my fingers for fighting.
     My rock and my fortress,
         my tower, my deliverer,
     my shield, behind whom I take refuge,
         who lays nations low at my feet.


     LORD, what are mortals
         that you care for them,
     humans,
         that you think of them?
     They are like a breath,
         their days as a shadow that passes.


     LORD, bow your heavens and come down:
         touch the hills, so that they smoke.
     Flash forth lightning and scatter them,
         your arrows send forth and confound them.


     Stretch out your hand from on high;
         pluck me out of the mighty waters,
         out of the hands of foreigners,
     who speak with the mouth of falsehood,
         and lift their right hand to swear lies.


     O God, a new song I would sing you,
         on a ten-stringed harp make you music.
     For to kings you give the victory,
         and David your servant you save.
     Snatch me from the cruel sword,
         rescue me from the hand of foreigners,
     who speak with the mouth of falsehood,
         and lift their right hand to swear lies.

*The Prosperity of the Lord's People*


     May our sons in their youth
         be as plants well tended:
     our daughters like cornices
         carved as in palaces.


     May our barns be bursting
         with produce of all kinds.
     In the fields may our sheep bear
         by thousands and ten thousands.


     May our cattle be fat,
         our walls unbreached,
     may no cry of distress
         ring in our streets.


     Happy the people
         who fares so well:
     and so fares the people
         whose God is the LORD.

*Psalm 145 -- The Kingdom Everlasting*
     A song of praise. Of David.

     I will exalt you, my God, O king:
         I will praise your name for ever and ever.
     I will bless you every day:
         I will praise your name for ever and ever.


     Great is the LORD and worthy all praise,
         his greatness is unsearchable.
     One age to another shall praise your deeds,
         declaring the mighty things you have done.


     Of your glorious majesty they shall tell,
         and I will muse of your many wonders.
     Of the might of your terrible acts they shall speak,
         and the tale of your great deeds I will tell.


     The fame of your abundant goodness
         and righteousness they shall pour forth in song.
     The LORD is full of grace and pity,
         patient and rich in loving-kindness.


     The LORD is good to all the world,
         and his pity is over all things that he made.
     All your works give you thanks, O LORD,
         and you are blessed of those who love you.


     They shall speak of your glorious kingdom,
         and of your might shall they discourse,
     making known to all his mighty acts,
         and the glorious majesty of his kingdom.


     Yours is a kingdom that lives through all ages:
         through all generations extends your dominion.


     The LORD upholds all who fall;
         he lifts up all who are bowed down.
     The eyes of all look in hope to you,
         and you give them their food in due season.


     You yourself open your hand,
         and fill with your favour all things that live.
     The LORD is righteous in all his ways,
         gracious is he in all that he does.


     The LORD is near to all who call him,
         to all who call upon him in truth.
     He will fulfil the desires of those who fear him;
         he will hear their cry for help and save them.


     The LORD is the keeper of all who love him,
         but all the wicked will he destroy.
     My mouth will utter the praise of the LORD,
         and all life will bless his holy name
             for ever and ever.

*Psalm 146 -- The Great Protector*


     My soul, praise the LORD.
         I will praise the LORD, while I live;
     I will sing to my God, while I am.


     Put not your trust in princes
         mortals, in whom is no help.
     When their breath goes out,
         they go back to the dust:
     on that very day
         their purposes perish.
         Happy those whose help
         is the God of Jacob:
     whose hope is set
         on the LORD their God,
     the Creator of heaven and earth,
         the sea, and all that is in them.


     He remains eternally loyal.
         For the wronged he executes justice;
     he gives bread to the hungry;
         the LORD releases the prisoners.
     The LORD gives sight to the blind:
         the LORD raises those who are bowed.
     The LORD loves the righteous.
         The LORD preserves the stranger,
     upholds the widow and orphan,
         but the wicked he leads to disaster.


     The LORD shall reign forever,
         your God, O Zion, to all generations.
             Hallelujah.

*Psalm 147 -- The Lord's Love and Power Revealed in Nature*


             Hallelujah.
     It is good to sing praise to our God,
         for praise is sweet and seemly.
     The LORD builds up Jerusalem,
         the outcasts of Israel he gathers.
     He heals the broken in heart,
         and binds up their wounds.
     He counts the numberless stars,
         he gives names to them all.
     Great is our LORD, rich in power,
         and measureless is his wisdom.
     The LORD lifts up the down-trodden,
         the wicked he brings to the ground.


     Sing songs of thanks to the LORD,
         and play on the lyre to our God.
     For he covers the sky with clouds,
         he prepares rain for the earth,
         makes grass to grow on the mountains.
     He gives the cattle their food
         the young ravens when they cry.
     His pleasure is not in the strength of the horse,
         his joy is not in the speed of a runner;
     but the LORD has his pleasure in those who fear him,
         in those who wait for his kindness.


     Praise the LORD, then, O Jerusalem:
         sing praise to your God, O Zion.
     For he strengthens the bars of your gates,
         and blesses your children within you.
     He brings peace to your borders,
         and choicest of wheat in abundance.
     He sends his command to the earth:
         his word runs very swiftly.
     Snow he gives like wool,
         frost he scatters like ashes.
     He casts forth his ice like morsels:
         who can stand before his cold?
     He sends forth his word, and melts them:
         his wind blows the waters flow.


     He declares his word to Jacob,
         his statutes and judgments to Israel.
     No other nation did he do this for,
         they know nothing of his judgments.
             Hallelujah.

*Psalm 148 -- The Universal Chorus of Praise*


     Praise the LORD from the heavens,
         praise him in the heights.
     Praise him, all his angels;
         praise him, all his hosts.


     Praise him, sun and moon;
         praise him, all stars of light.
     Praise him, you highest heavens,
         and you waters above the heavens.


     Let them praise the name of the LORD,
         for at his command they were made.
     And he fixed them for ever and ever
         by a law which they dare not transgress.


     Praise the LORD from the earth:
         you depths, with your monsters, all.
     Fire, hail, snow and ice,
         and stormy wind doing his word.


     All you mountains and hills,
         all you fruit trees and cedars,
     all you wild beasts and tame,
         creeping things, birds on the wing.


     All you kings and nations of earth;
         all you princes and judges of earth:
     young men and maidens together,
         old men and children together.


     Let them praise the name of the LORD,
         for his name alone is exalted.
     Over heaven and earth is his glory.
         He has lifted his people to honour.
     Wherefore this chorus of praise from his saints,
         from Israel, the people who stand in his fellowship.
             Hallelujah.

*Psalm 149 -- Song of Victory*


             Hallelujah.
     Sing to the LORD a new song,
         sound his praise where the faithful are gathered.
     Let Israel rejoice in its maker,
         sons of Zion exult in their king.
     Let them praise his name in the dance,
         making music with lyre and with timbrel.
     For the LORD delights in his people,
         adorning the humble with victory.


     Let the faithful exult and extol him
         with glad ringing cries all night long.
     High praises of God in their mouth,
         and a two-edged sword in their hand:
     on the heathen to execute vengeance,
         and chastisement sore on the nations,
     binding their kings with chains,
         and their nobles with fetters of iron,
     to execute on them the doom that is written.


         This is the glory of all his faithful.
             Hallelujah.

*Psalm 150 -- Hallelujah*


     Hallelujah.
     Praise God in his holy place.
         Praise him in the sky, his stronghold.
     Praise him for his deeds of power.
         Praise him for his boundless greatness.


     Praise him with blast of horn;
         praise him with harp and lyre.
     Praise him with timbrel and dance;
         praise him with strings and pipe.
     Praise him with resounding cymbals,
         praise him with clashing cymbals.
     Let all that has breath praise the LORD.
             Hallelujah.

########################################################################


                                 HOSEA


*Introduction*

     The LORD's message to Hosea son of Beeri during the reigns of Kings
Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah of Judah and during the reign of King
Jeroboam, son of Joash of Israel.

*The adultery of Hosea's wife*

     When the LORD began to speak through Hosea, he said to him:

     'Go marry an unfaithful woman
     who will bear you children by her adultery,
     for like an adulterous wife the land is unfaithful to the LORD.'
     So he married Gomer, the daughter of Dibliam, and when she
conceived and bore him a son, the LORD said:

     'Call him "Jezreel," for in a little while
     I will punish the dynasty of Jehu
     for the blood shed at the valley of Jezreel,
     I will cause the kingdom of Israel to cease.
     On that day, I will break Israel's bows and arrows
     in the valley of Jezreel.'
     When she conceived again and bore a daughter, the LORD said to
Hosea:

     'Call her Lo-Ruhamah -- "No-Compassion"
     for I will no longer have compassion on Israel,
     certainly not spare them.


     But on Judah I will have compassion,
     I will deliver them by the LORD their God,
     but I will not deliver them by bow nor by sword,
     nor by battle nor by horses nor by horsemen.'
     After she had weaned No-Compassion, and when she conceived and bore
a son, he said:

     'Call him Lo-Ammi -- "Not-My-People"
     for you, Israel, are not my people,
     and I indeed am not your God.'


     Yet the number of the Israelites
     will be as the sand of the sea,
     which cannot be measured or counted,
     and where they were told, 'You are not my people,'
     they will be called, 'children of the living God.'
     The Judeans and the Israelites
     will join together again,
     will appoint for themselves one leader,
     will return to their own land.
     Great will be the day of Jezreel!
     So call your brothers, My People,
     and your sisters, Compassion.


     Accuse, accuse your mother:
     for she is not my wife,
     and I will not be her husband.
     Let her put her acts of infidelity out of her sight,
     and her lovers from between her breasts,
     else I will strip her bare,
     expose her as she was on the day of her birth,
     make her like the wilderness,
     let her become like a parched land,
     and let her die of thirst.
     And on her children I will have no pity,
     since they are children of adultery,
     for their mother has become a prostitute,
     she who conceived them has behaved shamefully.


     She has said,
     'I will go after my lovers
     who gave me my bread and my water,
     my wool, my flax, my oil, and my drink.'
     That is why I am going to hedge up her ways with thorns,
     and build a wall about her,
     so that she cannot find her paths.
     She will pursue her lovers,
     but will not overtake them.
     She will seek them,
     but not find them.
     In time she will say,
     'I will go back to my first husband,
     I was better off then than now.'
     She herself did not know
     that it was I who gave her
     the grain, the sweet wine, and the oil,
     who lavished on her silver and gold --
     that they used in worshipping Baal!
      So I will take back my grain at the harvest,
     and my sweet wine in its season.
     I will withdraw my wool and my flax,
     given to cover her nakedness;
     and so I will strip her naked before her lovers,
     and no one can deliver her out of my hand.
     I will end all her celebrations,
     her yearly feasts, her new moons, and her sabbaths,
     all her festivals.
     I will lay waste her vines and her fig trees,
     of which she says, 'These are my wages
     which my lovers have given me.'
     I will make them a thicket,
     and the wild animals will eat them.
     In this way I will punish her for the days of the Baals,
     in which she made offerings to them,
     and decked herself with earrings and jewels,
     and went after her lovers,
     but forgot me,
     -- declares the LORD.


     So I am going to court her,
     bring her into the wilderness,
     and speak tenderly to her.
     I will give her from there her vineyards,
     and the valley of Achor as a door of hope.
     There she will respond as in the days of her youth,
     as in the days when she came up from the land of Egypt.
     At that time, declares the LORD,
     you will call me your husband,
     and will no more call me your master.
     I will remove the name of the Baals from her mouth,
     their names never again uttered.
     On that day I will make for them a covenant
     with the wild animals,
     the birds of the sky,
     and the creatures that crawl on the earth.
     I will break the bow and the sword,
     banish battle from the land,
     and I will make them lie down in safety.
     I will take you for my wife forever,
     I will take you for my wife in righteousness,
     in justice, in kindness, and in mercy.
     I will take you for my wife in faithfulness,
     and you will know the LORD.


     On that day I will answer
     -- declares the LORD,
     I will answer the empty skies,
     and they will answer the dry earth.
     The earth will answer with grain,
     and new wine and oil,
     and they will answer Jezreel,
     and I will plant her in the land.
     I will have compassion to No-Compassion,
     I will say to Not-My-People, 'You are my people,'
     and they will say, 'You are my God.'
     Then the LORD said to me, 'Go again, show love to this woman, who
is loved by another, who commits adultery. Love her as the LORD loves
the Israelites, though they turn to other gods, and love the raisin
cakes offered to idols.
     So I redeemed her for fifteen pieces of silver and a homer and a
lethek of barley. And I told her, 'You must live with me for many days
and you must not sleep around or marry another. And I will do the same
for you.
     And like this the Israelites will live for a long time without king
and without prince, without sacrifice and without pillar, without ephod
and without teraphim. Yet afterward the Israelites will return, and seek
the LORD their God and their Davidic king, and in the days to come they
will turn with awe to the LORD and his goodness.

*The Lord's case against Israel*


     Hear the LORD's message, Israelites,
     for the LORD has brought charges against the inhabitants of the
land,
     for there is no fidelity, nor true love,
     nor knowledge of God in the land,
     but cursing, lying, and murder,
     stealing, committing adultery, and deeds of violence,
     and acts of bloodshed quickly follow each other.
     Therefore the land mourns,
     all its inhabitants languish,
     the wild animals and the birds of the skies,
     even the fish of the sea are dying.
     Yet let no one bring charges,
     let none accuse,
     for your people are like those,
     who bring charges against a priest{  (4:4)  Heb. uncertain. }.
     You stumble by day,
     and the prophet stumbles with you by night,
     and I will destroy your mother.
     My people are being destroyed for lack of knowledge;
     because you have rejected knowledge
     I reject you from being priest to me.
     Since you have forgotten the teaching of your God,
     I also will forget your children.


     The more priests there are, the more they sin against me.
     I will change their dignity to dishonour.
     They feed on the sin offerings of my people,
     so they hunger after their guilt.
     Thus it comes to be, like people, like priest:
     I will visit upon each punishment for their ways,
     and their deeds I will repay them.
     They will eat and not be satisfied,
     they will sleep around but stay childless,
     because they have abandoned the LORD
     to give themselves to prostitution.


     Old and new wine take away the understanding.
     My own people ask counsel of a piece of wood!
     A stick gives them advice!
     For a spirit of prostitution has led them astray,
     they commit adultery against their God.
     On the heights of the mountains they sacrifice,
     and on the hills they burn incense
     under oaks and poplars and terebinths,
     for their shade is so pleasant.
     Therefore your daughters become cult prostitutes,
     and your daughters-in-law commit adultery.


     I will not punish your daughters for committing prostitution,
     nor your daughters-in-law for adultery.
     Your men visit prostitutes,
     sacrifice with cult prostitutes.
     So a people without understanding come to ruin!
     Though you commit adultery, Israel,
     let not Judah become guilty.
     Do not go to Gilgal,
     do not go up to Beth-aven,
     nor swear an oath, 'As the LORD lives.'


     Like a wilful heifer,
     Israel is stubborn.
     Can the LORD now feed them
     as he would a lamb in a broad pasture?
      Ephraim is wedded to idols.
     Leave them alone!
     When their drinking is over
     they sleep with the cult prostitutes,
     their rulers love shameful ways.{  (4:18)  Heb. uncertain. }
      A windstorm will wrap them in its wings
     and they will be ashamed of their sacrifices{  (4:19)  LXX: altars.
}.

*The guilt of priests and princes*


     Hear this, priests!
     Attend, Israelites!
     Listen, royal family!
     For you is the judgment:
     a snare you have become at Mizpeh,
     and a net spread out on Tabor,
     the rebels are deep in slaughter,
     but I will discipline all.
      I know Ephraim,
     Israel is not hidden from me,
     for you, Ephraim, have committed prostitution
     and Israel is defiled.
     Their deeds do not permit them
     to return to their God.
     For the spirit of prostitution is within them,
     they do not know the LORD.
     Israel's arrogance testifies against them,
     Israel, even Ephraim, stumble in their sin,
     and Judah also stumbles with them.
     With their sheep and their cattle
     they will go to seek the LORD
     but they will not find him,
     he has withdrawn from them,
     for they have been untrue to the LORD,
     their children are strangers.
     Their new moon festivals will soon destroy them and their fields.


     Blow the trumpet in Gibeah,
     the clarion in Ramah!
     Raise the alarm in Beth-aven:
     we are with you, Benjamin!{  (5:8)  LXX: make Benjamin tremble }
     Ephraim will become a desolation
     in the day of punishment,
     concerning the tribes of Israel
     I make known what is certain.
     The princes of Israel have become
     like thieves who move boundary stones.
     On them I will pour out my wrath like a flood.
     Ephraim will be oppressed, crushed by judgment,
     for they are determined to go after vanity{  (5:11)  So LXX. Heb.
uncertain.  }.


     So I am like a moth to Ephraim,
     like rottenness to the house of Judah.
     For when Ephraim saw their sickness
     and Israel their wound,
     Ephraim turned to Assyria,
     to its patron king.
     But he cannot heal you
     nor relieve you of your wound.
     For I myself will be like a lion to Ephraim,
     like a young lion to the house of Judah.
     I, yes I, will rend and go my way,
     I will carry off and none will rescue.

*The lack of repentance and reform*


     I will return to my place,
     until in remorse they seek my presence.
     When they are in distress they will quickly seek me,
     saying, 'Come let us return to the LORD,
     for he has torn us
     but he will heal us,
     he has injured us
     but he will bandage our wounds,
     he will revive in a couple of days,
     on the third day he will raise us up again,
     to live in his presence.
     Let us know, let us eagerly seek to know the LORD.
     His coming is as sure as the sunrise.
     He will come to us like the winter rain,
     as the spring rain that waters the earth.'


     What can I make of you, Ephraim!
     What can I make of you, Judah!
     Your love is like a morning cloud,
     like the dew which early goes away.
     That is why I have hewn them by the prophets,
     I have slain them by the words of my mouth.
     My judgment is like the light that goes forth,
     for it is love that I delight in and not sacrifice,
     and knowledge of God and not burnt offerings.


     But they after the manner of men have transgressed the covenant,
     there they have played me false.
     Gilead is a city of evildoers,
     tracked with bloody footprints,
     and as bandits lie in wait for a man,
     so a band of priests murder on the way to Shechem.
     How terrible is the evil they do!
     In Bethel I have seen a horrible thing.
     There Ephraim plays the prostitute,
     Israel is defiled.
     Judah for you also a harvest is set.


     When I would restore the fortunes of my people,
     when I would heal Israel,
     then Ephrain's guilt is revealed,
     and Samaria's crimes are seen,
     how they practise fraud
     and the thief enters in,
     while outside bandits plunder.
     But it never crosses their minds
     that I remember their wickedness.
     Now their misdeeds surround them,
     they are always before my face.


     Their wickedness amuses the king,
     and their lying gladdens the princes,
     since they are all of them adulterers.
     Their desire to do evil
     burns like an oven heated by the baker,
     so hot that he need not stir the fire,
     from the kneading of the dough, until it rises.
     On our king's festival day,
     the princes are flushed with fever from wine.
     He stretched forth his hand with the contemptuous{  (7:5)  Heb.
uncertain },
     for like an oven their heart burns with treachery,
     all night their anger smoulders,
     in the morning it blazes into a flame of fire.
     All of them glow like an oven,
     they devour their rulers.
     All their kings have fallen.
     There is none among them who calls to me.

*Evidence of the nation's iniquity*


     Ephraim -- he lets himself be mixed among the peoples,
     Ephraim -- he has become a cake unturned.
     Strangers have devoured his strength, but he does not know it.
     His hair is sprinkled with grey, but he does not notice.
     Israel's arrogance testifies against them
     yet they do not return to the LORD their God,
     and in all this they do not seek him.


     Ephraim is like a simple, silly dove:
     to Egypt they call, after Assyria they go,
     wherever they turn I will spread my net over them,
     like birds of the sky I will bring them down,
     I will catch them when I hear them gathering.
     Woe to them, for they have strayed from me!
     Destruction to them, for they have been untrue to me.


     Although it was I who redeemed them,
     they speak lies about me.
     They have never cried to me with their hearts,
     but they are always wailing on their beds.
     They gather to beg for corn and new wine,
     but they turn away from me.
     Although it was I who trained and strengthened their arms,
     concerning me they plan only evil.
     They turn away from the Most High{  (7:16)  Heb. uncertain. }.
     They have become like a bow that swerves.
     Their princes will fall by the sword,
     because of the insolence of their tongues.
     The land of Egypt will mock them.
     Put the horn to your mouth!
     An eagle swoops down upon the house of the LORD{  (8:1)  Heb.
uncertain }
     because they have transgressed my covenant,
     trespassed against my law.
     To me they continually cry,
     'My God, we Israel, we know you!'
     But Israel has spurned that which is good,
     so let the foe pursue him.

*The Lord's rejection of Israel's rulers and idols*


     They themselves have made kings
     but without my consent.
     They have made princes
     but without my knowledge.
     Out of their silver and gold,
     they have made idols to their destruction!
     Your calf idol, O Samaria, is distasteful.
     My anger is kindled against them.
     How long will they escape punishment?
     Israel made the thing:
     a workman made it.
     It is not a god!
     Samaria's calf will become mere splinters.
     They sow the wind and will reap the whirlwind.
     A shoot which has no stalk, yields no fruit
     If it should yield, strangers would devour it.


     Israel is devoured.
     Already it lies discarded among the nations
     like a worthless pot.
     For by themselves they have gone up to Assyria
     like a wild donkey which wanders by itself.
     Ephraim pays for love
     but even if they sell themselves among the nations,
     I will round them up.
     Soon the kings and princes will writhe under the burden of tribute!


     For as many altars as Ephraim has erected,
     they are to him altars for sinning,
     were I to write for him ever so many instructions,
     they would be regarded as from a stranger.
     The people love sacrifice, and so they offer sacrifices,
     meat, and so they eat it,
     although the LORD is not pleased with them,
     so now he will remember their guilt,
     and punish their sins.
     Back to Egypt with them!
     For Israel forgot his Maker and built palaces,
     and Judah multiplied fortified cities.
     But I will send fire upon her cities,
     and it will devour her strongholds.

*The horrors of the coming exile*


     Rejoice not too loudly, Israel,
     like the nations,
     for you have commited adultery,
     being untrue to your God.
     You have loved a prostitute's wages
     on every threshing floor.
     Threshing floor and wine vat won't feed them,
     the new wine will fail them.
     They will not stay in the LORD's land,
     but Ephraim will return to Egypt,
     and in Assyria they will eat what is unclean.


     They will not pour out libations of wine to the LORD,
     nor please him with their sacrifices.
     Their bread will be like the bread of mourners:
     all who eat it will defile themselves.
     For their bread will be only for their hunger,
     it will not come into the LORD's temple.
     What will you do on the day of the festival?
     Or on the day of the LORD's feast?


     Even if they flee from destruction,
     Egypt will gather them,
     Memphis will bury them.
     Nettles will take possession of their treasure of silver,
     thorns will push into their tents.


     The days of punishment are come,
     the days of recompense are at hand,
     as soon the Israelites will know!
     'The prophet is a fool,
     the inspired man is raving mad!'
     It is because of the greatness of your iniquity
     and the greatness of your hatred.
     Ephraim acts the spy with my God,
     a prophet finds the snares of a fowler are in all his ways.
     In the house of his God they lay hostile plots,
     they commit crimes as in the days of Gibeah,
     God will remember their iniquity.
     He will punish their sin.

*Israel's corruption*


     I found Israel
     like finding grapes in the wilderness.
     I saw your ancestors
     like they were the first fruit on a fig tree,
     but as soon as they came to Baal-peor,
     they consecrated themselves to shamefulness,
     and became as abominable as the object of their love.


     Ephraim -- like a bird his glory flies away.
     There will be no more birth,
     no more motherhood,
     no more conception.
     Even though they bring up their children,
     I will bereave them until not one is left.
     Woe to them when I turn away from them!


     Ephraim -- planted like Tyre in a meadow{  (9:13)  Heb. uncertain.
LXX: as I have seen, his sons are destined to be a prey },
     But Ephraim too must lead forth their children to slaughter.
     Give them, LORD -- what will you give?
     Give them a miscarrying womb and shrivelled up breasts!


     All their evil began in Gilgal,
     there I learned to hate them.
     Because of the evil of their deeds
     I will drive them out of my house.
     I will no longer love them,
     for all their princes are rebels.
     Ephraim is blighted,
     their root withered.
     If they do bear children,
     I will slay the darlings of their womb,
     My God will reject them
     because they have not listened to him,
     and they will become wanderers among the nations.
     A luxuriant vine is Israel.
     He bore fruit lavishly.
     In proportion to the increase of his fruit
     he increased altars to idols.
     In proportion to the beauty of his land
     he made beautiful the sacred pillars.


     Their heart is false,
     now they must be punished.
     God himself will break the necks of their altars,
     he will destroy their sacred pillars.


     Yes, soon they will be saying,
     'We have no king,
     for we have not revered the LORD,
     and a king, what could he do for us anyway?'


     Speaking words, perjuring themselves, making agreements,
     and litigation springs up like a poisonous weed in a ploughed
field.


     The inhabitants of Samaria will tremble with fear
     for their calf of Beth-aven.
     Its people will mourn over it,
     and so will its priests,
     who had rejoiced for its glory,
     now departed from it.
     It will be carried off to Assyria
     as a present to the patron king.
     Disgrace will Ephraim bear
     and Israel will be ashamed of its idol.


     As for Samaria, her king will disappear,
     like foam on the face of the waters.


     And the high places of Aven will be destroyed,
     the shrines of Israel's sin,
     thorns and thistles will grow on their altars,
     and they will say to the mountains, 'Cover us,'
     and to the hills, 'Fall upon us.'

*What a nation sows, it will reap*


     From the time of Gibeah, Israel has sinned.
     There they took their stand.
     Will not war overtake them in Gibeah
     because of the wicked?
     When I please, I will punish them.
     Nations will gather against them
     to chain them for their double crimes.


     Ephraim indeed was a trained heifer that loved to thresh grain,
     and I myself laid a yoke upon his fair neck{  (10:11)  Heb.
uncertain. },
     I made Ephraim draw and Judah must plough,
     Jacob must turn the soil for himself.
     Sow for yourselves righteousness,
     reap the fruits of love.
     Break up your fallow ground,
     for it is time to seek the LORD,
     so righteousness may come to you{  (10:12)  Heb. uncertain }.
     But you have ploughed wickedness,
     iniquity have you reaped.
     You have eaten the fruit of lies.


     Because you have trusted in your own path{  (10:13)  LXX: chariots
},
     in the multitude of your warriors,
     the alarm of war will sound in your cities
     and all your fortresses will be ruined,
     as Shalman laid in ruins Beth-arbel in the day of battle,
     when mothers were dashed to pieces over their children.
     Thus will I do to you, Bethel,
     because of the enormity of your wickedness.
     When dawn breaks, so will the king of Israel be broken.

*The Lord's love for his faithless people*


     When Israel was young, then I began to love him,
     and out of Egypt I called my son.
     The more I called them,
     the further they went away from me.
     They kept sacrificing to Baals
     and making offerings to idols.


     Yet it was I who taught Ephraim to walk,
     taking them up in my arms,
     but they did not know that I healed them.
     With humane cords I ever drew them,
     with bands of love.
     I was to them as one who lifts up the yoke from off their jaws,
     and bending toward them, I gave them food to eat.


     No! They return to the land of Egypt,
     Assyria will be their king,
     for they have refused to return to me.
     Therefore the swords will whirl in their cities,
     will devour in their fortresses{  (11:6)  Heb. uncertain }.
     For my people are bent in rebellion against me,
     even if they call on the Most High he will not raise them{  (11:7)
Heb. uncertain. }.


     How can I give you up, Ephraim!
     Give you over, Israel!
     How am I to give you up as Admah!
     Make you like Zeboim!
     My heart asserts itself,
     my sympathies are all aglow.
     I will not carry into effect the fierceness of my anger,
     I will not turn to destroy Ephraim,
     for God am I, and not man,
     holy in the midst of you,
     therefore I will not consume.


     They will follow after the LORD.
     Like a lion he will roar,
     and when he roars
     his children will come trembling from the west.
     They will come trembling like the birds from Egypt,
     like doves from the land of Assyria.
     And I will bring them back to their houses,
     -- declares the LORD.


*Israel's faithlessness from the first*


     Ephraim has encompassed me with falsehood,
     and the house of Israel with deceit.
     But Judah still wanders with God
     faithful to the Holy One{  (11:12)  Heb. uncertain. Or "Judah is
still restless against God" }.
     Ephraim herds the wind and hunts the sirocco.
     All day long they heap up falsehood and fraud,
     make a treaty with Assyria,
     and sends tribute of olive oil to Egypt.
     The LORD has a charge to bring against Israel,
     to punish Jacob for his acts,
     according to his deeds will he requite him,
     In the womb he supplanted his brother,
     in manhood he wrestled with God,
     He wrestled with the angel and prevailed,
     he wept and sought his blessing.
     At Bethel the LORD found him,
     and there he spoke with us.
     And the LORD is the God of hosts,
     the LORD is his name!
     So now, by the help of your God, return.
     Keep true love and justice.
     Trust in your God without ceasing.


     A merchant uses false scales:
     They love to defraud.
     Ephraim says, 'Yes, I have become rich,
     I have secured wealth for myself.
     But despite my gains
     no one will find a crime I can be convicted of!'
     I am the LORD your God,
     ever since the land of Egypt.
     I will make you again dwell in tents,
     as in days of old.


     I spoke continually by the prophets.
     It was I who multiplied visions,
     and spoke in parables through the prophets.


     In Gilead is iniquity,
     they will come to nothing.
     In Gilgal they sacrifice bulls,
     so their altars will be as stone heaps,
     among the furrows of the field.
     And Jacob fled to the territory of Aram,
     and Israel worked to earn a wife:
     for a wife he herded sheep.
     The LORD brought Israel up from Egypt by a prophet,
     and by a prophet Israel was guarded.


     Ephraim has given bitter provocation.
     His Lord will leave upon him his guilt of bloodshed,
     and for his contempt he will repay him.

*The Lord's final destruction of the guilty nation*


     When Ephraim used to speak there was trembling;
     a prince was he in Israel.
     But he incurred guilt through Baal and died.
     And now they go on sinning.
     They make for themselves molten gods --
     idols of silver, skilfully made,
     wholly the work of smiths.
     Yet to such they sacrifice!
     And they who sacrifice kiss calf idols{  (13:2)  Heb. uncertain }!


     Therefore they will be like the morning mist,
     like the dew that early disappears,
     like the chaff which blows away from the threshing floor,
     like the smoke from the window.


     Yet it was I, the LORD your God,
     ever since the land of Egypt,
     you know no other god but me,
     nor has there been any saviour except me.


     It was I who shepherded you in the wilderness,
     in the land of burning heat.
     When they were pastured
     they became full,
     when they were full
     their hearts became proud.
     Therefore they forgot me!


     So now I will be to them like a lion,
     like a leopard will I lay in wait by the path.
     I will fall upon them like a bear robbed of her cubs,
     I will tear open their chests,
     like a lion will devour them,
     and like a wild beast will tear them in pieces.


     You are destroyed, Israel,
     by me, your only helper.
     I want to rule you!
     Where are your princes in your cities,
     those of whom you demanded,
     'Give me kings and princes.'
     I give you kings in my anger,
     and take them away in my wrath.


     Ephrahn's iniquity is gathered up,
     his sin is laid by in store.
     The pangs of childbirth come upon him,
     but he is an unwise child.
     For this is no time to refuse to leave the womb!


     Should I deliver them from the power of Sheol?
     Should I redeem them from death?
     Death, where are your plagues?
     Sheol, where is your pestilence?
     Compassion is forever hidden from my eyes.


     Though he is flourishing among his brothers{  (13:15)  Or: in the
midst of the reeds },
     there will come an east wind,
     the LORD's wind,
     coming up from the wilderness.
     His fountain will dry up,
     his spring will be parched.
     The wind will strip the treasury,
     all the precious things.


     Samaria will bear her guilt,
     for she has rebelled against her God.
     They will fall by the sword,
     their children dashed to pieces,
     their pregnant women ripped open.

*Words of exhortation and promise*


     Return, Israel, to the LORD your God,
     for you have stumbled in your iniquity.
     Take words of repentance with you,
     and return to the LORD your God.


     Say to him:
     Wholly pardon our iniquity,
     accept that which is good,
     instead of sacrificing bulls,
     we offer our praise.
     Assyria will not save us,
     nor Egyptian warhorses,
     and we will no more call
     the work of our hands our gods.
     For in you orphan Israel finds mercy.


     'I will heal their apostasy,
     I will love them freely,
     now that my anger is turned away from them,
     I will be as dew to Israel.
     He will blossom like the lily,
     he will plant his roots like the cedars of Lebanon,
     his saplings will spread out,
     his beauty will be like that of the olive tree,
     his fragrance like the cedars of Lebanon.


     People will return and dwell in my shade,
     they will bring life to new grain.
     They will sprout like the vine,
     and their renown will be like that of the wine of Lebanon.


     Ephraim -- what have I to do with idols!
     It is I the LORD who respond to him and look after him.
     I am like an evergreen cypress,
     from me is your fruit found.


     Whoever is wise,
     let him discern these things,
     prudent, let him perceive them;
     For the LORD's ways are straight,
     and the righteous walk in them,
     but the wicked stumble in them.

                                  JOEL

     The LORD's message that came to Joel, son of Pethuel.

*Locust plague and drought*


     Hear this, elders,
         pay attention, all inhabitants of the land.
     Has anything like this happened in your days,
         or in the days of your ancestors?
     Recount it to your children;
         let your children tell it to their children,
         and their children to the generation that follows.


     That which the cutting locust has left,
         the swarming locust has eaten,
     that which the swarming locust has left,
         the hopping locust has eaten,
     and that which the hopping locust has left,
         the destroying locust has eaten.


     Awake, drunkards, and weep,
         and wail, all drinkers of wine;
         the new wine is cut off from your mouth.
     For a nation has come up on my land,
         powerful, and numberless;
     its teeth are the teeth of a lion,
         and its jaw-teeth are like those of a lioness.
     It has laid waste my vines,
         and barked my fig tree;
     it has peeled and cast it away,
         bleached are the branches.


     Wail as a bride, clad in sack-cloth,
         for the husband of her youth.
     Cut off are the cereal and drink-offerings
         from the house of the LORD;
     in mourning are the priests,
         who minister at the LORD's altar.
     The fields are blasted,
         the land is in mourning,
     for ruined is the corn,
         the new wine fails
         and the oil is dried up.
     Be dismayed, farmers;
         wail, vine-dressers.
     For the wheat and the barley;
         for the harvest is lost from the fields.
     The vine fails to bear fruit,
         and the fig tree is drooping;
     the pomegranate, palm, and apple,
         all the trees of the field are dried up.
     The people's joy withers.


     Put on sackcloth, and beat your breasts, priests;
         wail, ministers of the altar;
         come, lie all night in sack-cloth, ministers of God;
     for cereal-offering and drink-offering
         are cut off from the house of your God.


     Sanctify a fast,
         summon an assembly,
     gather the elders and all the inhabitants of the land
         into the house of the LORD your God,
     cry to the LORD:
         Alas for the day!
     Near at hand is the day of the LORD,
         and as destruction from the Almighty it comes.


     Is not food cut off
         from before us,
     gladness and joy
         from the house of our God?
     The grains shrivel under their hoes,
         the storehouses are desolate,
         the barns broken down,
         for the corn is withered.
     How the herds of cattle bellow in distress,
         for they have no pasture!
     The flocks of sheep are forlorn.


     To you, the LORD, I cry.
     For fire has devoured
         the pastures of the wilderness,
         and flame has scorched
         all the trees of the field.
     The wild animals also look up to you longingly,
         for the water-courses are dried up,
         and fire has devoured the pastures of the wilderness.


     Blow a horn in Zion,
         sound an alarm in my holy mountain,
     let all the inhabitants of the land tremble,
         for the day of the LORD comes,
         for near is the day of darkness and gloom,
         the day of cloud and thick darkness!


     Like the light of dawn scattered over the mountains,
         a people great and powerful;
     its like has not been from of old,
         neither will be any more after it,
         even to the years of coming ages.


     Before them the fire devours,
         and behind them a flame burns;
     like the garden of Eden is the land before them,
         and after them it is a desolate desert,
     nothing escapes them.


     Their appearance is as the appearance of horses,
         and like horsemen they charge.
     Like the sound of chariots on the tops of the mountains they leap,
         like the crackle of flames devouring stubble,
     like a mighty people preparing for battle.


     Peoples are in anguish before them,
         all faces grow pale.


     Like mighty men they run,
         like warriors they mount up a wall,
     they march each by himself,
         they break not their ranks,
     none jostles the other.


     They march each in his path.
         They fall upon the weapons without breaking.
     They scour the city, they run on the wall.
         They climb up into the houses.
     Like a thief they enter the windows.


     Earth trembles before them,
         the sky quakes,
     the sun and moon become dark,
         and the stars withdraw their shining;
     and the LORD utters his voice before his army,
         for his host is exceedingly great.
     Mighty is he who performs his word.
         For great is the day of the LORD,
     it is terrible, who can endure it?


     But now this is the message of the LORD:
     Turn to me with all your heart,
         and with fasting and weeping and mourning,
     rend your hearts and not your garments,
         and turn to the LORD your God;
     for he indeed is gracious and merciful,
         slow to anger and plenteous in love,
     and relents of the evil.
     Who knows but he will turn and relent,
         and leave a blessing behind him,
         a cereal and drink-offering for the LORD your God.


     Blow a horn in Zion,
         sanctify a fast, summon an assembly,
     gather the people, make holy the congregation,
         assemble the elders,
     gather the children,
         and the infants at the breast.
     Let the bridegroom come forth from his chamber,
         and the bride from her bridal tent.


     Between the porch and the altar,
     let the priests, the ministers of the LORD weep aloud,
     let them say:
         Spare, the LORD, your people.
         Make not your heritage an object of reproach,
         for the heathen to mock them.
         Why should it be said among the nations, "Where is their God?"

*Future blessings*

     Then the LORD became deeply concerned for his land, and took pity
upon his people, and the LORD answered and said to his people:

     I will send you corn, wine, and oil.
         You will be satisfied.
     I will not make you again
         an object of scorn among the nations,
     I will remove far from you the northern foe,
         and I will drive it into a land barren and desolate,
     its front into the eastern sea,
         and its rear to the western sea.
     And from it a stench will arise.


     He has done great things!
     Fear not, land, exult.
         Rejoice for the LORD has done great things!
     Fear not, animals of the field.
         For the pastures of the wilderness are putting forth new grass,
     for the trees bear their fruit,
         fig tree and vine yield full harvest.
     Be glad, then, children of Zion,
         and rejoice in the LORD your God,
     for he has given you the early rain in just measure,
         and poured down upon you the winter rain,
     and sent the latter rain as before.
     The threshing floors will be full of grain,
         and the vats will overflow with new wine and oil.


     I will repay you for the years
         which the swarming locust has eaten.
     The hopping, the destroying, and the cutting locusts,
         my great army which I sent among you,
         and my people will never again be put to shame.
     You will eat your food and be satisfied,
         and praise the name of the LORD your God,
     who has dealt so wonderfully by you,
     and you will know that I am in the midst of Israel,
         that I am the LORD your God and none else,
         and my people will never again be put to shame.


     Afterwards,
         I will pour out my spirit on everyone.
     Your sons and your daughters will prophesy,
         your old men will dream dreams.
     Your young men will see visions,
         and even on your male and female slaves
     in those days, I will pour out my spirit.


     And I will show signs in the sky and on earth:
         Blood and fire and pillars of smoke.
     The sun will be turned into darkness,
         and the moon into blood
     before the coming of the great and terrible day of the LORD.
     But whoever will call upon the name of the LORD will be saved. For
in Mount Zion and in Jerusalem there will be those who escape, even as
the LORD has said, and among the fugitives those whom the LORD calls.
     For, in those days and in that time, when I bring back again the
captivity of Judah and Jerusalem, I will also gather all the nations and
bring them down into the Valley of Jehoshaphat, and there I will enter
into judgment with them for my people and my heritage Israel, whom they
have scattered among the nations, and divided my land.

     They have cast lots for my people.
     They have traded boys
         for prostitutes,
     and sold girls for wine,
         and drunk it.
     What are you to me, Tyre and Sidon and all the districts of
Philistia? Were you repaying any deed of mine, or were you doing
something for me? Quickly will I return your deed upon your heads. You
who have taken my silver and my gold, and you have brought my goodly
jewels into your palaces, you have sold the people of Judah and of
Jerusalem to the Greeks, so that you might remove them far from their
own borders. I am about to stir them up from the place to which you have
sold them, and I will turn your deeds upon your own head. I will sell
your sons and your daughters into the hands of the people of Judah, and
they will sell them to the Sabeans, to a nation far off, for the LORD
has spoken.

     Proclaim this among the nations, sanctify war.
     Arouse the warriors,
         let all the fighting men muster and go up.
     Beat your ploughshares into swords,
         and your pruning-hooks into lances;
     let the weak say, I, indeed, am strong.
     Bestir yourselves and come,
         all you nations round about.
     Quickly gather yourselves together,
         ask the LORD to bring his warriors.


     Let the nations rouse themselves
         and come up to the Valley of Jehoshaphat,
     for there will I sit to judge
         all the surrounding nations.
     Put in the sickle,
         for the harvest is ripe;
     go in, tread,
         for the wine press is full.
     The vats overflow,
         for great is their wickedness.
     Noisy multitudes, noisy multitudes
         in the valley of decision.
     For near is the LORD's day in the valley of decision!


     Sun and moon have turned dark,
         and the stars withdrawn their shining.


     Whenever the LORD roars from Zion
         and utters his voice from Jerusalem,
     earth and sky quake;
     but the LORD is a refuge to his people,
         and a fortress to the people of Israel.
     And you will know that I am the LORD your God,
         I who dwells in Zion, my holy mountain,
     and Jerusalem will be holy,
         and strangers will not pass through her any more.


     In that day,
         the mountains will drop sweet wine,
     the hills will flow with milk,
         all the channels of Judah will flow with water,
     a fountain will spring from the house of Judah,
         and will water the Valley of Shittim.
     Egypt will become a desolation,
         and Edom a wilderness,
     because of the violence done to the people of Judah,
         because they shed innocent blood in their land,
     Judah will remain inhabited forever,
         and Jerusalem from generation to generation.
     I will avenge their blood which I have not yet avenged.


     The LORD lives in Zion!

                                  AMOS

     The message of Amos, one of the sheep breeders of Tekoa, which he
saw concerning Israel in the reign of King Uzziah of Judah, and in the
reign of Jeroboam the son of King Joash of Israel, two years before the
earthquake. Amos said:

     Whenever the LORD roars from Zion,
     and utters his voice from Jerusalem,
     the pastures of the shepherds dry up,
     the top of Carmel becomes arid.

*God's Judgment on Israel's Neighbours*


     The LORD says:


     For Damascus' three crimes -- no, four! --
     I will not rescind my judgment.
     They have threshed Gilead
     with threshing instruments of iron.
     Therefore I will send fire on Hazael's house,
     it will devour the palaces of Ben-hadad.
     I will break open the gate of Damascus,
     I will wipe out those who live in the valley of Aven
     and the sceptred ruler of Beth-Eden.
     The people of Aram will go into captivity in Kir,
     says the LORD.


     The LORD says:


     For Gaza's three crimes -- no, four! --
     I will not rescind my judgment.
     They carried away captive a whole nation,
     sold them as slaves to Edom.
     Therefore I will send fire on the wall of Gaza,
     and it will devour her palaces.
     And I will wipe out those who live in Ashdod,
     and the sceptred ruler of Askelon.
     I will turn my hand against Ekron,
     and the remnant of the Philistines will perish,
     says the LORD.


     The LORD says:


     For Tyre's three crimes -- no, four! --
     I will not rescind my judgment.
     They carried away captive a whole people into exile in Edom,
     and did not remember the brotherly covenant.
     So I will send fire on the walls of Tyre.
     It will devour her palaces.


     The LORD says:


     For Edom's three crimes -- no, four! --
     I will not rescind my judgment.
     They pursued their relatives with the sword,
     stilled their pity,
     cherished their anger continually,
     retained their fury forever.
     So I will send a fire into Teman.
     It will destroy the palaces of Bozrah.


     The LORD says:


     For Ammonites' three crimes -- no, four! --
     I will not rescind my judgment.
     They have ripped open pregnant women in Gilead,
     in their lust for land.
     So I will kindle a fire on the wall of Rabbah.
     It will destroy her palaces,
     with a war-cry in the day of battle,
     with a tempest in the day of the whirlwind.
     Their king will go into exile,
     he and his nobles together,
     says the LORD.


     The LORD says:


     For Moab's three crimes -- no, four! --
     I will not rescind my judgment.
     They have burned to lime the bones of the king of Edom,
     to desecrate the dead.
     So I will send a fire into Moab.
     It will devour the palaces of Kirioth,
     with a war-cry,
     with the sound of trumpets.
     I will kill the ruler,
     all his nobles I will slay with him,
     says the LORD.


     The LORD says:


     For Judah's three crimes -- no, four! --
     I will not rescind my judgment.
     They have rejected the law of the LORD
     and have not kept his statutes.
     Instead their false gods their ancestors followed,
     have led them astray.
     So I will send a fire on Judah.
     It will devour the palaces of Jerusalem.

*God's Judgment on Israel*


     The LORD says:
     For Israel's three crimes -- no, four! --
     I will not rescind my judgment.
     They sell the righteous for money,
     the needy for a pair of shoes.
     They trample on the head of the poor,
     push the humble out of the way.
     Father and son go to the same temple girl,
     and so profane my holy name.
     They stretch themselves
     on garments taken in pledges beside every altar,
     and they drink the wine
     of those who have been fined in the house of their God.


     It was I who destroyed the Amorites for your sake,
     whose height was like that of the cedars,
     as strong as oaks.
     I destroyed their fruit from above
     and their roots from below.


     It was I who brought you up from the land of Egypt,
     led you forty years in the wilderness,
     brought you here to possess the land of the Amorites.


     I raised up some of your sons to be prophets
     some of your youths to be Nazirites.
     Is not this indeed so, Israelites?
     says the LORD.
     But you made the Nazirites drink wine
     and banned the prophets from prophesying.


     Listen!
     It is I who will make you groan in your places,
     as a wagon groans under its load of grain.


     Then flight will fail the swift,
     and the strength of the strongest will be useless.
     The warrior will not save his life,
     the archer will not stand firm,
     the swift of foot will not escape,
     the horseman will not save his life.
     The bravest of warriors
     will flee away naked in that day,
     says the LORD.

*A Warning to Israel*


     Listen to this message, Israelites,
     which the LORD has spoken against you,
     against the whole nation that I brought out of Egypt:
     You alone have I cared for of all the nations of the world,
     this is why I will punish you for your crimes.


     Do two walk together
     unless they agreed to meet?
     Does a lion roar in the forest
     when there is no prey for him?
     Does a young lion cry out in his den
     unless he has caught something?
     Does a bird swoop down into a trap
     if no bait is set for it?
     Does a trap spring up from the ground
     if nothing sets it off?
     Can a trumpet be blown in a city
     and the people not tremble?
     Can disaster strike a city
     and the LORD not have caused it?


     Surely the Lord GOD does nothing
     without revealing his purpose to his servants the prophets.
     The lion has roared; who does not fear?
     The Lord GOD has spoken; who will not prophesy?


     Proclaim over the palaces in Ashdod,
     and over the palaces in the land of Egypt:
     Gather upon the mountain of Samaria,
     and see the violent turmoil,
     the acts of oppression in her midst.
     For they do not know how to do right.
     They are heaping up violence
     and oppression in their palaces,
     says the LORD.


     Therefore the Lord GOD says:


     An enemy will surround the land,
     he will strip your strength from you.
     and your palaces will be looted.


     The LORD says:


     Just as a shepherd rescues from the jaws of a lion
     two shinbones or a piece of an ear,
     so the Israelites living in Sameria will be rescued --
     with the corner of a couch,
     and the damask of a divan!


     Listen and testify against the house of Jacob,
     says the Lord GOD, the God of hosts.
     On the day when I punish Israel for their crimes,
     I will also visit in judgment the altars of Bethel,
     the horns of the altar will be hacked off,
     and they will fall to the ground.
     I will destroy the winter houses
     together with the summer houses
     and the houses of ivory will perish.
     Many great houses will be swept away,
     says the LORD.


     Listen to this message, women of Sameria,
     you well-fed cows of Bashan,
     who oppress the poor and crush the needy,
     who say to your husbands, 'Bring us another drink!'


     The Lord GOD has sworn by his holiness:
     The time is coming when you will be carried away in baskets,
     your children carried away in fish-baskets,
     and through the breaches in the city wall you will go,
     thrown out on the garbage dump,
     says the LORD.


     Come to Bethel and transgress,
     at Gilgald increase your transgression.
     Bring your sacrifices in the morning,
     every third day your tithes!


     Burn some leavened bread as a thank-offering,
     proclaim aloud your voluntary offerings,
     for you love to do this, Israelites!
     says the Lord GOD.


     But it was I who gave to you
     empty stomachs in all your cities,
     and lack of bread in all your towns,
     yet you have not returned to me,
     says the LORD.


     It was I who withheld from you the rain,
     sending rain on one city,
     while on another I allowed no rain.
     One field received rain,
     while a field without rain withered.
     People from two or three cities
     ranged as far as another city
     for drinking water,
     and still they did not have enough,
     yet you did not return to me,
     says the LORD.


     I struck you with blight and mildew,
     I laid waste your gardens and vineyards.
     The swarming locust devoured your fig and your olive trees,
     yet you did not return to me,
     says the LORD.


     I sent plague among you like the plagues of Egypt,
     I slew your youths with the sword, your horses raided away,
     I caused the stench of your camps to rise in your nostrils,
     yet you did not return to me,
     says the LORD.


     I wrought a destruction among you,
     as God destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah.
     You were like a stick snatched from the fire,
     yet you did not return to me,
     says the LORD.


     Therefore this is what I will do to you, Israel,
     and because I am about to do this to you,
     prepare to meet your God, Israel.


     He is here!
     He who forms the mountains,
     creates the wind,
     declares to his thoughts to mortals,
     makes dawn and darkness,
     treads upon the heights of the earth,
     the LORD, the God of hosts, is his name!

*A Funeral Song for Israel*


     Listen to the words of the funeral song
     I am singing for you, Israel:
     Fallen, no more to rise, is the virgin Israel!
     Hurled down upon her own soil she lies,
     with no one to lift her up!


     For the Lord GOD says this:
     The city that marches out with a thousand soldiers
     has only a hundred left,
     and the one that marches out with a hundred
     has only ten left.


     For the LORD says this to Israel:
     Seek me and live,
     But do not seek Bethel,
     do not enter Gilgal,
     do not go over to Beer-sheba.
     For Gilgal will enter exile,
     and Bethel will go to destruction.


     Seek the LORD and live,
     or he will cast fire on the house of Joseph,
     and it will devour
     and there will be no one to quench it for Bethel.


     You who turn judgment to bitter wormwood,
     and cast righteousness into the dirt:


     He who made the Pleiades and Orion,
     who turns deep darkness into dawn,
     who darkens day again into night,
     who summons the waters of the sea,
     and pours them out on the earth's surface,
     the LORD is his name!
     He causes destruction to burst over the strong.
     He brings devastation on the fortress.


     You who hate the arbiters at the city gate,
     and abhor anyone who speaks the truth:


     Because you trample on the weak,
     and tax their grain,
     although you have built houses of hewn stone,
     you will not live in them,
     although you have planted charming vineyards,
     you will not drink their wine.
     For I know how many are your crimes,
     and how great are your sins!
     You persecutors of the righteous, takers of bribes!
     You deny the poor their justice at the city gate.


     It would be wise to keep quiet in such an evil time.


     Seek good and not evil,
     that you may live,
     so the LORD, God of hosts,
     may be with you, as you have claimed he is.


     Hate evil and love good,
     establish justice at the city gate.
     Perhaps the LORD, the God of hosts,
     will be gracious to a surviving remnant of Joseph.


     Therefore the LORD, the God of hosts, says:
     In all the public squares there will be wailing,
     in every street the sound of mourning.
     They will summon the farmers to mourning,
     and professional mourners to wailing.
     In all vineyards there will be lamenting,
     when I pass through your midst,
     says the LORD.


     Fools who long for the day of the LORD!
     What does the day of the LORD mean to you?
     It is darkness, and not light.
     It is as when one flees from a lion,
     and is attacked by a bear,
     as when one reaches home, leans his hand on the wall,
     and a snake bites him.
     Won't the LORD's day be darkness and not light,
     murky darkness without a ray of light in it?


     I hate, I despise your feasts,
     I will not smell the savour of your festivals,
     I will not be pleased with your burnt offerings,
     your grain offerings,
     I will not accept the peace offerings
     of your fattened calves.
     Spare me the noise of your songs,
     I will not listen to the melody of your lyres.
     But let justice roll on as a flood of waters,
     and righteousness like an unfailing stream.


     Was it only sacrifices and grain offerings
     you brought me
     during the forty years in the wilderness, Israel?
     But now you will lift up your "king" Sikkuth
     and "star god" Kiyyun,
     your idols which you have made for yourselves,
     as I drive you into exile beyond Damascus,
     says the LORD, whose name is the God of hosts.


*The Destruction of Israel*


     Sorrow awaits who are carefree in Zion,
     overconfident on the mountain of Samaria!
     The elite of this, the best of nations,
     on whom the people of Israel rest their hopes!


     You say to the people:
     Cross over to Calneh and see,
     go from there to Hamath the great,
     then go down to Gath of the Philistines:
     Are they better than these kingdoms?
     Is their territory larger than yours?
     You push away all thoughts of the evil day,
     yet have instituted a rule of violence.


     They lie on ivory couches,
     sprawl on their divans,
     eat choice lambs from the flock,
     and fattened calves from the stall.
     They idly sing to the sound of the lyre,
     thinking themselves songwriters like David,
     they drink bowlfuls of wine,
     and anoint themselves with the finest of oil.
     But they do not grieve over the ruin of Joseph.


     Therefore now they must go into exile
     at the head of the captives,
     and hushed will be the revelry of the sprawlers.


     The Lord GOD,
     the LORD, the God of hosts, has sworn by himself:
     I abhor the pride of Jacob,
     I hate his palaces,
     therefore I will deliver up the city
     and all that is in it to their enemies.
     If ten people remain in one house, then they will die. When the
uncle and another member of the family of a dead man come to carry the
body out of the house for burial, they will call to someone in a corner
of the house, "Any more there?" and he will answer, "No", and then he
will add, "Be quiet!" -- for the name of the LORD must not be mentioned.

     Look! The LORD is giving the command!
     He will smash the large house to bits,
     the small house into fragments.


     Do horses gallop on crags?
     Does one plough the sea with oxen?
     Yet you turn justice into poison weed,
     and the fruit of righteousness into bitter wormwood.


     You who are so proud
     of capturing Lo-debar,
     who say, "Have we not by our own strength
     taken Karnaim for ourselves?"
     I am now raising up against you,
     Israel, a nation,
     says the LORD, the God of hosts.
     They will oppress you,
     from the entrance of Hamath
     to the brook of the Arabah.

*A Vision of Locusts*

     This is what the Lord GOD showed me: he was forming a swarm of
locusts, when the late spring grass began to come up after the king's
share had been harvested. And when they had finished devouring all the
land's vegetation, I said:

     'Lord GOD, forgive, I beg you!
     How can Jacob survive,
     for he is so helpless?'
     The LORD relented. This will not happen,' said the LORD.


*A Vision of Fire*

      This is what he showed me: the Lord GOD was giving command to
execute judgment by fire. It burned up the great deep, and had begun to
devour the fields, and I said:

     'Lord GOD, forgive, I beg you!
     How can Jacob survive,
     for he is so helpless?'
      The LORD relented. 'This will not happen either,' said the LORD.

*A Vision of a Plumb Line*

      This is what the Lord GOD showed me: the Lord was standing beside
a wall built with a plumb line, with a plumb line in his hand. And the
LORD said to me,

     'What do you see, Amos?'
     And I answered,

     'A plumb line,'
     Then the Lord said,

     'Watch: I am setting a plumb line
     in the midst of my people Israel,
     I will no longer overlook their crookedness.
     And the high places of Isaac
     will be desolate,
     the sanctuaries of Israel
     will be laid waste,
     and I will rise up against the house of Jeroboam
     with the sword.'

*Amaziah and Amos*

     Then Amaziah, chief priest of Bethel sent this message to King
Jeroboam of Israel: 'Amos has conspired against you right in the heart
of Israel. The country cannot survive all his words. Amos has said,
"Jeroboam will die by the sword, and Israel will be led away captive out
of their land."'
     And Amaziah said to Amos, 'Leave, you who see visions, go to the
land of Judah. Earn your bread there and prophesy there, but don't
prophesy any more at Bethel, for it is the king's sanctuary, and it is
the royal residence.'
     'I am no prophet,' Amos answered Amaziah, 'nor trained as one.  I
am a shepherd and a keeper of sycamores fig trees. But the LORD took me
away from following the flock, and the LORD said to me, "Go, prophesy to
my people Israel." Now therefore listen to the LORD's message:

     "You say not to prophesy against Israel,
     nor to preach against the house of Isaac.
     But the LORD says:
     Your wife will become a prostitute in the city,
     your sons and your daughters will fall by the sword,
     your land will be divided up,
     you will die on unclean soil,
     and Israel will be led away captive out of their land."'

*The Time is Ripe*

     The Lord GOD showed me this: a basket of summer fruit. 'What do you
see, Amos?' he asked. I replied, 'A basket of ripe summer fruit.' Then
the LORD said to me:

     The time is ripe for my people Israel,
     I will no longer overlook their crimes.
     The singing women in the palace will howl on that day,
     says the LORD:
     Corpses everywhere,
     thrown out in silence.
     Listen to this, you who trample on the needy,
     who oppress the poor of the earth, saying:
     When will the feast of the new moon be over
     so that we may sell grain?
     And the sabbath ended
     so that we may offer wheat for sale?
     Reducing the measure and increasing the price,
     cheating with false scales,
     mixing the sweepings in with the wheat.
     Then we can buy the poor for money,
     the needy for a pair of shoes.


     Now the LORD has taken an oath
     by the Pride of Jacob:
     I will never forget all their deeds!
     Because of this won't the land quake,
     and all its inhabitants mourn?
     Won't the whole of it rise like the Nile,
     churn and subside like the Nile in Egypt?


     On that day, says the Lord GOD,
     I will make the sun set at noon
     and darken the earth in broad daylight.
     I will turn your feasts into mourning,
     all your songs into dirges.
     I will cause you to dress in sackcloth,
     every head shaved.
     I will make you mourn like you have lost your only son,
     all that happens will end in bitterness.


     The day is coming, says the Lord GOD,
     when I will send hunger in the land.
     Not a famine of bread or thirst for water,
     but for hearing the message of the LORD.
     Then they will wander from sea to sea,
     from the north to the east,
     to seek a message from the LORD,
     but they will not find it.
     In that day beautiful girls and strong young men
     will faint from thirst.


     Those who take oaths by the shameful idol of Samaria,
     who swear, "As surely as your God lives, O Dan!"
     and, "By the sacred way to Beer-sheba!" --
     they will fall and never rise again.
      I saw the Lord towering above the altar, and he commanded:

     Strike the tops of the pillars
     so that the foundations may shake,
     bring them down on the heads of the people below.
     The rest of them I will slay with the sword:
     no one will get away,
     no one will escape.


     If they dig down to Sheol,
     there will my hand take them.
     If they climb up to the heavens,
     from there will I bring them down.
     If they hide themselves on the top of Carmel,
     there will I search them out and take them.
     If they hide out of my sight at the bottom of the sea,
     there will I command the sea serpent to bite them.
     If they are taken into captivity by their enemies,
     there will I command the sword to slay them.
     I will keep my eye on them
     but for evil and not for good.


     It is the Lord the GOD of hosts,
     who touches the earth and it trembles,
     all who live on it mourn.
     The earth rises up like the Nile,
     and sinks like the Nile of Egypt.
     The one who builds in the heavens,
     who sets the dome of the sky over the earth,
     who summons the waters of the sea
     and pours them out on the face of the earth:
     the LORD is his name.


     To me, Israelites, you are
     just like the Cushites,
     says the  LORD.
     Yes, I brought Israel up out of the land of Egypt,
     but also the Philistines from Caphtor,
     and the Arameans from Kir!
     Behold the eyes of the Lord GOD
     are on the sinful kingdom:
     I will destroy it from the face of the earth!
     But I will not completely destroy the house of Jacob,
     says the LORD.
     For behold I am about to give the command,
     and I will shake the house of Israel among all the nations
     just as one shakes grain in a sieve,
     but not a pebble will fall to the ground.
     All the sinners of my people,
     who deny that disaster will touch or befall them,
     will die by the sword.

*A Promise of Restoration*



     On that day I will raise up the fallen house of David,
     I will wall up its gaps and raise up its ruins,
     I will rebuild it as it was long ago.
     They will possess again the rest of Edom,
     and all the nations which once you ruled for me,
     says the LORD, who will do this.


     Listen! The days are coming, says the LORD,
     when the harvest is too big to reap
     before it is time to plough,
     when the grapes cannot be all trod
     before it is time to sow,
     when the mountains will run with sweet wine,
     and every hill will flow with it.


     I will bring back my people Israel,
     they will rebuild waste cities and inhabit them,
     plant vineyards and drink their wine,
     make gardens and eat their fruit.
     I will plant them on their own soil,
     and they will never again be uprooted from their land
     which I have given them,
     says the LORD your God.

                                OBADIAH

     The vision of Obadiah; what the LORD said about Edom:

     We have heard a report from the LORD,
         a messenger has been sent among the nations;
     Rise up, let us rise against Edom in battle!


     I will make you small among the nations,
         and despised by all!
     Your proud heart has misled you,
         you who live in the clefts of the rock,
         you who build on high your dwelling.
     You say to yourselves,
         "Who can bring me down to earth?"
     Though you build high as the eagle,
         though between the stars you set your nest,
     from there will I bring you down,
         says the LORD.


     If thieves had come to you, marauders by night
         would they not have stolen only as much as they needed?
     If grape-gatherers had come to you
         would they not have left some gleanings?
     Descendents of Esau,
         all your treasures are looted.
     To your border they have driven you,
         all your allies have betrayed you.
     Your avowed friends have overpowered you,
         they have set a trap for you.
     Where is your wisdom now?
     The LORD says:

     On that day,
     I will destroy the wise of Edom,
         drive wisdom out of Mount Esau.
     Your warriors will be filled with terror, Teman,
         none will be left alive on Mount Esau.


     Because of the violence done to your relatives, the people of
Jacob,
         shame covers you,
         you are cut off forever.
     In the day when you stood aloof,
         in the day when strangers carried away their wealth,
         and strangers entered into their gates,
         and over Jerusalem cast lots,
     you were as one of those strangers.


     You should not have gloated over your relatives,
         in the day of their misfortune.
     You should not have exulted over the land of Judah
         in the day of their destruction.
     You should not have laughed loudly
         at their distress.
     You should not have entered in at the gate of my people
         in the day of their disaster.
     You should not have gloated over their calamity,
         in the day of their disaster,
     nor stretched out your hand after their wealth
         in the day of their disaster,
     nor stood at the crossroads
         to cut down their fugitives,
     nor should you have betrayed their refugees
         in the day of distress.


     Near at hand is the LORD's day for all the nations.
     As you have done so will it be done to you.
     Your deeds will come back on your own head.


     As you have drunk upon my holy mountain,
         so all the nations will drink in turn;
     They will drink deep
         and be as though they had not been.


     But on Mount Zion some will escape,
         it will be again holy,
     and those of the house of Jacob
         will again enter into their possessions.
     For the house of Jacob will be a fire,
         and the house of Joseph a flame,
     but the house of Esau will become stubble.
         They will kindle and devour it.
     Not even one of the house of Esau will escape,
         for the LORD has spoken.


     They will possess the Negeb and Mount Esau,
         and the Shephelah of the Philistines.
     They will possess the territory of Ephraim and Samaria,
         and Benjamin will possess Gilead.
     The exiles of Israel will possess the land of the Canaanites
         as far as Zarephath.
     The captives of Jerusalem who are in Sepharad
         will possess the cities of the Negreb.
     The rescued will come up on Mount Zion to rule Mount Esau,
         and the kingdom will belong to the LORD.

                                 JONAH


*Jonah runs away*

     This message from the LORD came to Jonah, the son of Amittai:
'Arise, go to that great city, Nineveh, and preach against it; for their
wickedness is known to me.' But Jonah started to flee to Tarshish from
the presence of the LORD. He went down to Joppa and found a ship going
to Tarshish. So he paid the fare and went aboard to go with them to
Tarshish from the presence of the LORD. But the LORD made a furious wind
blow over the sea, and there was such a great storm that the ship was in
danger of breaking to pieces. The sailors were terrified and each cried
for help to his own god. They threw the ship's cargo into the sea to
make the ship lighter. Meanwhile Jonah had gone down into the bottom of
the ship and lay fast asleep. The captain of the ship went and said to
him, 'How can you sleep? Call on your god; perhaps that god will think
of us, so that we may not be lost.'
     The sailors said to one another, 'Come, let us cast lots to
discover on whose account this evil has come upon us.' So they cast
lots, and the lot indicated Jonah. So they said to him, 'Are you to
blame for this? Tell us, what is your business, and where do you come
from? What is your country and to what people do you belong?' He
replied, 'I am a Hebrew, and a worshipper of the LORD, the God of
heaven, who made the sea and the dry land.' Then the men were greatly
frightened and said to him, 'What have you done?' For they knew that he
was fleeing from the presence of the LORD, because he had told them.
     Then they said to him, 'What should we do to you, to make the sea
calm for us?' For the sea grew more and more stormy. He said to them,
'Take me up and throw me into the sea, and the sea will be calm for you,
for I know that it is because of me this fierce storm has overtaken
you.'
     But instead the men rowed hard to get back to the land; they could
not, however, for the sea grew more and more stormy ahead. So they cried
to the LORD and said, 'We beg you, LORD, we beg you, don't let us die
for this man's life, and don't let us be guilty of shedding innocent
blood, for you are the LORD; you have done as it pleases you.' And they
took up Jonah, and threw him into the sea; and the sea became calm. Then
the men greatly feared the LORD, and they offered a sacrifice and made
vows to him.
     But the LORD arranged for a great fish to swallow Jonah, and Jonah
was inside the fish three days and three nights.

*Jonah's song*

     Jonah prayed to the LORD his God, out of the belly of the fish, and
said:

     I cried out of my distress, to the LORD
         and he answered me;
     out of the midst of Sheol I cried aloud,
         and you heard my voice.


     For you cast me into the deep,
         into heart of the seas,
         and the great flood rolled about me;
     all your breakers and your waves
         passed over me.


     Then I said, I am driven out,
         away from your sight;
     How will I ever again
         look towards your holy temple?


     The waters surrounded me,
         the great deep engulfed me,
         the sea weeds were wrapped about my head.
     I went down to the roots of the mountains;
         the prison of the earth closed over me forever.


     Yet you brought up my life from destruction,
         O LORD my God.
     As my life slipped away,
         I remembered the LORD;
     and my prayer reached you,
         in your holy temple.


     Those who worship worthless idols
         abandon their own mercy,
     but I will sacrifice to you
         with loud thanksgiving!
     I will pay that which I have vowed.
         Salvation is the LORD's.
     And the LORD spoke to the fish, and it threw up Jonah upon the dry
land.

*The message to Nineveh*

     This message from the LORD came to Jonah the second time, 'Arise,
go to that great city, Nineveh, and proclaim to it the message that I
tell you.' So Jonah started for Nineveh, as the LORD commanded. Now
Nineveh was so large a city that it took three days' journey to cross
it. Jonah began by going a day's journey into the city, and he
proclaimed, 'Forty days more and Nineveh will be overthrown.'
     And the people of Nineveh believed God; and they ordered a fast and
put on sackcloth, from the greatest to the least of them. And when word
came to the king of Nineveh, he rose from his throne, took off his robe,
dressed in sackcloth, and sat in ashes. And he made this proclamation
and published it in Nineveh: 'By the decree of the king and his nobles:
People, beast, herd, and flock must not taste anything; let them not eat
nor drink water. Let both people and animals put on sackcloth and let
them cry earnestly to God; let them each turn from their evil ways and
from the deeds of violence which they are doing. Who knows? God may
relent and avert his fierce anger, so that we may not die.'
     When God saw that they turned from their evil course, he relented
the evil which he said he would do to them, and did not do it.

*Jonah sulks*

     But this seemed very wrong to Jonah and he became angry. He prayed
to the LORD and said, 'Ah, LORD, wasn't this what I said when I was
still in my own country? That was why I fled at once to Tarshish; for I
knew that you are a gracious and merciful God, patient, and loving and
ready to forgive. Therefore, LORD, I beg you, take my life from me; for
it is better for me to die than to live!' But the LORD said, 'Are you
doing right in being angry?'
     Then Jonah went out of the city and sat down on the east side, and
there made a hut for himself and sat under it, waiting to see what would
become of the city. And the LORD arranged for a bush to grow up over
Jonah as a shade for his head to make him comfortable. The bush gave
Jonah great pleasure; but at dawn the next day God arranged for a worm
which attacked the bush, so that it wilted. And when the sun rose, God
arranged a hot east wind. And the sun beat upon Jonah's head, so that he
was faint and begged that he might die, saying, 'It is better for me to
die than to live.' But God said to Jonah, 'Are you doing right in being
angry about the bush?' He replied, 'I have every right to be as angry as
I could possibly be!'

*Jonah is rebuked*

     The LORD said, 'You care about a bush which has cost you no trouble
and which you have not made grow, which came up in a night and wilted in
a night. Should I not care for the great city Nineveh, in which there
are one hundred and twenty thousand people who do not know their right
hand from their left; and many cattle too?'

*The Superscription to Micah's Sermons*

     The LORD's message which came to Micah of Morsheth in the reigns of
Jotham, Ahaz and Hezekiah, kings of Judah. The visions he saw about
Samaria and Jerusalem.

*The Lord's Judgment on Guilty Samaria and Judah*


     Listen, all you peoples!
     Pay attention, all you inhabitants of the earth!
     For the Lord GOD will be a witness against you,
     the Lord from his holy temple!


     The LORD is coming from his holy place,
     he descends and treads on the heights of the earth,
     so that the mountains melt beneath
     like wax in the presence of the fire,
     and the valleys break apart
     like water poured down a steep descent.


     All this is because of the crime of Jacob,
     and for the sin of the house of Israel.
     What was the crime of Jacob?
     Was it not Samaria?
     What is the sin of Judah?
     Is it not Jerusalem?


     'I will make Samaria a ruin in an open field,
     and a place where a vineyard is planted,
     I will hurl down her stones into the valley,
     and lay bare her foundations.


     'All her images will be shattered,
     and all her statues will be burned with fire,
     and all her idols I will lay in ruins.
     For they were acquired by prostitution,
     and to prostitution they will return.'


     This is why I will mourn and wail,
     I will go barefoot and naked,
     I will howl like the jackals
     and mourn like the desert owl.


     For the blow that Samaria has received is incurable.
     It has spread over Judah,
     it extends even to the gate of my people,
     even to Jerusalem.


     Don't tell this in Gath!
     Don't even cry -- but sit in the dust at Beth-leaphrah.
     Pass by, inhabitants of Shaphir, naked and ashamed!
     The inhabitants of Zaanan cannot leave their city.
     Beth-ezel laments and removes its support from you.
     The inhabitants of Maroth wait anxiously for good!
     But the LORD has sent disaster to the gates of Jerusalem.
     Harness the horse to the chariot, inhabitants of Lachish.
     You led the daughter of Zion, Jerusalem, into sin,
     in you are found the crimes of Israel.
     Therefore you must give parting gifts to Moresheth-gath.
     Beth-achzib will betray the kings of Israel.
     I will hand you to a conqueror, people of Mareshah,
     the leaders of Israel will hide in Adullam Cave!
     Shave your head in mourning for the children you love,
     until you are bald as vultures, because they have left you for
exile.

*The Oppression of the Poor*


     Woe to those who lie awake planning evil,
     who in the light of morning carry out their plan
     because they have the power to do it.
     They covet fields and seize them,
     desire houses and take them,
     they crush householder and his household,
     people and their possessions.


     Therefore the LORD says:
     'I am planning disaster from which you cannot save your neck,
     nor walk proudly because it will be a terrible time.
     On that day they will sing a taunt-song to you,
     this mocking lament:
     "My people's estate is being measured for sale,
     our captors are dividing our fields.
     We are completely undone."
     There will be no one to measure out land for you
     from the LORD's community.


     '"Don't rant!" they urge, "Of such things one does not prophesy!
     Shame will not overtake us!
     Is the LORD impatient, or are such things his deeds?
     Are not his words favourable to the family of Jacob?"


     Aren't my commands good for those who obey them?
     But you, you stand up as a foe against those who are peaceful;
     you strip the robe from those who pass by quietly, averse to
conflict.
     Women of my people you drive out from their happy homes,
     from their young children you take away my glory forever.
     Rise and begone, for this is no place to rest.
     Your uncleanness brings destruction, severe destruction.
     If a person walking in wine and falsehood were to say,
     "I will prophesy to you of wine and strong drink,"
     then he would be the perfect prophet for this people!'

*The Lord Leading Back His Scattered People*


     'I will assuredly assemble all of Jacob,
     I will surely gather the survivors of Israel.
     I will herd them together as sheep in a fold,
     like a flock in the pasture,
     and the land will resound with the sounds of multitudes.


     'The one who breaks out goes first.
     They have broken forth and passed by the gate
     and through it have they gone out.
     Their king leads before them,
     the LORD at their head.'

*The Crimes of Judah's Civil and Spiritual Leaders*


     I also said:
     'Listen now, leaders of Jacob,
     judges of the house of Israel.
     Is it not your duty to know what is the right?
     Haters of that which is good and lovers of evil!


     'They devour the flesh of my people,
     and their hide they strip from off them,
     and break in pieces and serve up their bones,
     like meat in a pot or the cooking pan!


     'Then they will cry out to the LORD,
     but he will not pay attention to them.
     He will hide his face from them at that time
     because they have committed such crimes.'


     Therefore the LORD says:
     'To the prophets who lead my people astray,
     who when they have food between their teeth declare peace,
     but against one who puts nothing in their mouths,
     they proclaim an open war!


     'Night will overtake you so that you have no vision,
     and darkness so that there will be no divination,
     and the sun will go down on the prophets,
     and the day will be dark over them.


     'The seers will be ashamed,
     and the diviners will turn pale,
     all of them will cover their mouths.
     For there will be no answer from God.


     'But I, on the contrary am full of power,
     and the sense of justice and strength,
     to make known to Jacob his crime,
     and to Israel his sin.


     'Hear this, leaders of the house of Jacob,
     judges of the house of Israel,
     you who spurn justice,
     and make all that is straight crooked,
     who build Zion with acts of bloodshed,
     and Jerusalem with crime.


     'The leaders render judgment for a bribe,
     and her priests give oracles for a reward,
     and her prophets divine for silver.
     Yet they claim to rely on the LORD,
     "The LORD", they say, "is in our midst.
     Evil cannot overtake us."


     'Therefore for your sakes
     Zion will be plowed as a field,
     and Jerusalem will become a heap of ruins,
     and the temple mount a wooded height.'

*The Peace and Worldwide Renown of Zion*


     In the days to come
     the mountain of the LORD will be established,
     the house of our God on the top of the mountain,
     lifted above the hills.


     All the nations will flow to it,
     and many peoples will go and say,
     'Come, let us go up to the LORD's mount,
     to the house of the God of Jacob,
     so that he may instruct us in his ways,
     so that we may walk in his paths.'
     For from Zion proceeds instruction
     and the LORD's word from Jerusalem.


     He will arbitrate between many peoples,
     and render decisions for numerous nations,
     They will beat their swords into ploughshares,
     and their spears into pruning hooks.
     Nation will not lift up sword against nation,
     they will learn war no more.
     They will live each under his vine,
     and under his fig tree, with none to terrify them.
     For the mouth of the LORD of hosts has spoken.


     Each nation trusts in the names of their gods,
     but we will worship the LORD our God forever.


     'On that day,' says the LORD,
     'I will assemble the lame.
     I will gather exiles I punished.
     I will restore the lame as a remnant,
     the exiles into a great nation.
     The LORD will rule over them
     on Mount Zion from that time forever.'
     But you, watchtower for the flock,
     hill of the daughter of Zion,
     to you will return your former rule.
     So why do you now cry aloud? Haven't you any king?
     Or has your counsellor perished, so you writhe in pain like a woman
in labour?


     Writhe and scream, daughter of Zion, like a woman in labour!
     For now you must leave the city and camp in the open field.
     You will be taken to Babylon, but there will be rescued.
     There the LORD will save you from the hands of your foes.


     But now many nations gather against you.
     They say, 'Let her be defiled, we will gloat over Zion.'
     But they do not know the thoughts of the LORD.
     They do not understand his plan,
     for he has gathered them like sheaves for the threshing floor.


     'Arise, thresh, daughter of Zion.
     I will make your horns iron,
     and your hoofs brass,
     so you might beat in pieces many peoples,
     and devote to the LORD their spoil,
     and their wealth to the ruler of all the earth.


     'Now cut yourself in bitter grief,
     daughter besieged by soldiers.
     They have set a wall around you.
     They strike the ruler of Israel,
     in the face with a rod.


     'Bethlehem in Ephrathah,
     small among the tribes of Judah,
     from you will come a king
     who will rule for me over Israel,
     whose family line goes back to the distant past.'


     So the LORD will only abandon Israel to its enemies
     until the woman in labour gives birth.
     Then the survivors will be reunited with their own people.


     And he will stand and shepherd by the strength of the LORD,
     In the exalted name of the LORD his God;
     And they will live in security, for now he will be great,
     even to the ends of the earth.


     This will be our peace:
     when Assyria comes into our land
     and treads on our soil,
     we will raise up against him seven shepherds,
     eight leaders of men.
     They will shepherd Assyria with a sword,
     and the land of Nimrod with bared blades.
     They will deliver us from Assyria,
     when they come into our land,
     and tread within our borders.


     And the survivors of Jacob will be disbursed among the nations,
     in the midst of many peoples,
     like dew from the LORD,
     like showers on the grass,
     which don't wait for people to come
     or linger for mortals.


     And the survivors of Jacob will be disbursed among the nations,
     in the midst of many peoples,
     like a lion among the beasts of the forest,
     like a young lion among the sheep-folds,
     who, when he passes through, pounces.
     He savages his prey. There is no rescuer.
     Let your hand triumph over your adversaries,
     let all your enemies be cut off.


     On that day, says the LORD:
     'I will slaughter your horses from your midst,
     and destroy your chariots.
     I will devastate the cities in your land,
     and tear down your fortresses.
     I will destroy your magic charms,
     and you will have no soothsayers.
     I will cut down your idols and sacred pillars,
     and you will not worship any more the work of your hands.
     I will uproot your sacred poles,
     and destroy your idols.
     In my wrath and my anger
     I will seek vengeance on the nations that ignore me.'

*Israel's False Conception of the Lord's Character and Demands*


     Hear now what the LORD is saying:
     Arise, present your complaint before the mountains,
     let the hills hear your voice!
     Hear, mountains, the LORD's accusation,
     listen, foundations of the earth.
     For the LORD has a case against his people.
     He has a dispute with Israel.


     'My people, what have I done to you?
     How have I displeased you? Answer me!
     For I brought you up from the land of Egypt,
     from the land of slavery I redeemed you.
     I sent Moses, Aaron, and Miriam to lead you.
     My people, what did Balak, king of Moab counsel?
     And how did Balaam, the son of Beor, answer him?
     Remember now the journey from Shittim to Gilgal,
     so that you might realise the just deeds of the LORD.'


     With what should I come before the LORD?
     Bow myself before the God on high?
     Should I come before him with burnt-offerings,
     with calves a year old?
     Will the LORD be pleased with thousands of rams,
     With ten thousand streams of oil?
     Should I give him my firstborn son for my guilt,
     the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?


     The LORD has told you what is good,
     what he demands of you:
     Only to do justice and love mercy,
     and to walk humbly with your God.

*Guilt and Punishment of Jerusalem*


     Listen! The LORD calls to the city!
     Listen, tribe and assembly of the city!


     'Can I forget the hoarded treasures in the houses of the wicked,
     and the accursed scant measure?
     Can I leave her unpunished because of evil scales,
     and the bag of false weights?
     Whose rich people are full of violence,
     her inhabitants liars,
     whose tongues speak deceit?


     'But I indeed, have begun to punish you,
     to lay you in ruins because of your sins.
     You will eat but not be satisfied,
     your stomach empty within you.
     You will store up but lose everything,
     because whatever you save I will give to the sword.
     You will sow but not reap.
     You will tread the olives but have no oil for rubbing,
     tread grapes but drink no wine!


     'For you have followed the commands of Omri,
     and all the practices of the house of Ahab.
     You have acted in accord with their counsels,
     so I will give you up to ruin,
     the city's inhabitants to derision.
     The nations will treat you with contempt!'

*The Utter Degeneracy of the People*


     Woe, woe is me, for I have become
     like a field after harvest,
     like a vineyard after gathering;
     not a cluster of grapes to eat,
     not a fig that anyone desires.


     The honest have perished from the land,
     of the upright among people there is none.
     All of them lie in wait to shed blood.
     They hunt one another with the net.


     Their hands know well how to do evil,
     the officer and judge demands a bribe,
     the high official decides as he pleases
     and they conspire to pervert justice.


     The best of them are like a thorn thicket,
     their most upright like a prickly hedge.
     The day of their punishment has come,
     now will be their confusion!


     Do not trust your neighbour,
     do not rely on a friend.
     From the wife who lies in your arms
     guard your tongue.


     For son insults father,
     daughter rises up against mother,
     daughter-in-law against mother-in-law,
     a man's enemies are the people of his own household.

*Zion's Ultimate Vindication and Exaltation*


     But I will look to the LORD,
     I will wait for the God of my salvation.
     My God will hear me!
     Do not rejoice over me, my enemy.
     If I have fallen, I will rise.
     If I sit in darkness, the LORD is my light.
     The anger of the LORD I will bear,
     for against him have I sinned --
     until he champions my cause
     and gives judgment for me.
     He will bring me into to the light,
     I will see his justice.
     So my enemy will see, and shame will cover them,
     they who said, 'Where is the LORD your God?'
     I will look upon them,
     they will be trampled on like mud in the street!


     It is a day for rebuilding your walls,
     this day will your boundary will be extended.
     This day they will come to you,
     from Assyria and the cities of Egypt,
     and from Egypt even to the Euphrates River,
     from sea to sea, and from mountain to mountain.
     Though the land has become a desolation
     because of its inhabitants, because of their deeds.


     Shepherd your flock with your staff, the flock that belong to you,
     who live alone in the forest, in the midst of meadows;
     so that they may pasture in Bashon and Gilead as in the days of
old,
     as in the days when you came from Egypt, gave us wonders to see.
     Nations will see and be ashamed of all their might;
     they will put their hands to their mouth, their ears will become
deaf,
     they will lick the dust like snakes, like creatures that crawl on
the earth;
     they will come trembling and in terror from their hiding places, in
dread and fear.


     Who is a God like you, forgiving iniquity
     and passing by the rebellion of the remnant of your people?
     He does not retain his anger forever, but is one who delights in
mercy.
     He will tread under foot our iniquity;
     you will cast into the depths of the sea all our iniquities.
     You will show faithfulness to Jacob, and loving kindness to
Abraham,
     as you have sworn to our ancestors from the days of old.

                                 NAHUM

     A message about Nineveh, a vision which came to Nahum from Elkosh.

*God's wrath*


     The LORD tolerates no rivals.
         The LORD is vengeful and fierce in wrath.
     The LORD does not fail to punish his foes;
         the LORD is vengeful against his enemies.
     The LORD is slow to anger,
         great in power.
     The guilty will not escape
         his punishment.


     Storm tempest is his path
         and cloud is the dust of his feet.
     He rebukes the sea and dries it up
         and makes all the streams run dry.
     Bashan and Carmel are languishing
         and the bloom of Lebanon is withered.


     The mountains tremble before him
         and the hills dissolve.
     The earth heaves before him,
         the world and all who live in it.


     Who can stand before his wrath?
         Who can withstand the heat of his anger?
     His fierce fury pours forth like fire,
         he shatters rocks.


     The LORD is good to those who hope in him,
         a place of refuge in the day of trouble.


     With rushing flood an end he makes
         of those who rise against him,
     he drives his enemies into darkness.


     Why do you plot against the LORD?
         He will end you.
         He only takes vengeance once.


     Thorns, tangled and drenched,
         they are consumed like dry stubble.


     Nineveh! From you has arisen
         one who plots evil against the LORD,
         a counsellor of wickedness.

*Good news for Judah*

     The LORD says:

     'Though they are many and strong,
         they will pass away and be gone.
     Though I have afflicted you,
         I will afflict you no more,
     and now I will break his yoke from your necks
         and snap your chains.'
     The LORD has given this command concerning you, Nineveh:

     'Your name will no longer be remembered.
     I will destroy every idol and image
         in the house of your God.
     I will destroy even your tomb,
         for you are worthless.'


     Look! On the mountains a messenger
         bringing good news,
         announcing peace!
     'Celebrate the feasts, Judah,
         fulfil your vows.
     Never again will these enemies invade your land,
         they are destroyed!'

*Destruction of the city*


      Nineveh! The destroyer has come up against you;
         mount guard upon the rampart;
         watch the road; brace yourselves;
         strengthen your might to the utmost.


     For the LORD is restoring the majesty of Jacob
         and of Israel,
     though the devastators have plundered them
         and destroyed their vines.


     The shields of his warriors are dyed red,
         his soldiers are clothed in scarlet,
     his chariots gleam like fire
         on the day he prepares for battle
         spears are shaken.


     Chariots rush across the fields,
         storm through the squares;
     they flame like torches,
         they dart like lightening.


     A leader rallies his nobles,
         they hurl themselves forward.
     They speed on toward the wall;
         the storming-shield is set up.


     The water-gates are thrown open,
         and the palace dissolves in ruins.
     The queen is stripped,
         she is carried off.
     Her maids moan like doves,
         beating upon their breasts.


     Like a pool of water is Nineveh,
         her waters fast ebbing away.
     'Stand firm! Stand firm!' someone cries,
         but no one turns back.


     'Loot the silver, loot the gold,
         for there is no end to the treasure,
         the wealth and precious things.'


     Nineveh is empty, desolate, devastated,
         with faint heart and knocking knee.
     There is weakness in every limb,
         and faces grow pale.


     Where now is the den of lions?
         Where now the lair of their young?
     Where the lion used to withdraw,
         with his cubs, with none to disturb them?


     The lion tore enough for his cubs,
         and strangled prey for his lionesses.
     He filled his caves with the kill,
         he filled his lairs with fresh meat.


     'But see, I am against you,'
         the LORD of hosts declares,
     'I will burn your chariots in smoke and fire.
         The sword will devour your young lions.
     You will never again prey on the land.
         No more will your messengers be heard.'

*Ruin*


     Woe to the bloody city!
         Full of lies and plunder,
         without end is the spoil.
     Hear the crack of the whip,
         hear the rattle of wheels.
     Galloping horses,
         jolting chariots.
     Horsemen charging,
         swords flashing,
         spears glittering,
     a multitude of slain,
         a heap of bodies,
     no end to the corpses
         over which people stumble!


     'Because you acted like a whore,
         bewitching the nations,
         enticing the peoples,
     I am against you, Nineveh'
         the LORD of hosts declares.
     'I will strip your clothes
         and show the nations your nakedness,
         and the kingdoms your shame.


     'I will fling loathsome filth at you,
         and make you an object of contempt,
         a spectacle,
     so that everyone who sees you
         will flee from you and say:
     "Nineveh is laid waste,
         who will mourn for her?"


     'Are you any better than Thebes,
         which stood on the banks of the Nile,
     with waters around as a rampart,
         whose wall was the sea of waters?
     Her strength was Ethiopia and Egypt.
         The Libyans were her helpers,
         and Put with its countless people.
     Yet she was exiled
         and made captive.
     On all corners of the streets
         her infants were dashed to pieces.
     Lots were cast for her nobles,
         all her great ones were bound in chains.


     'You too, Nineveh, will be drunk with fear;
         you too will seek a place of escape from the foe.
     All your fortresses are fig trees with the first ripe figs;
         if shaken, they fall into the mouth of the eater!
     Your troops are weak as women before your foes;
         the gates of your land are wide open;
         your defenses burned down.


     'Draw water for the siege,
         strengthen your forts.
     Go to the clay pits and tread the clay;
         take up the brick moulds.
     There the fire will consume you,
         the sword will cut you down.


     Multiply like the locust
         or a swarm of grasshoppers.
     Increase the numbers of your merchants
         until they are more than the stars of heaven,
     until your watchmen are locusts,
         and your scribes like grasshoppers,
         which swarm in the hedges on a cold day;
     but when the sun rises
         they fly away,
         no one knows where.


     'King of Assyria:
         your princes slumber,
         your nobles sleep!
     Your people are scattered on the mountains
         with no one to gather them!
     There is no healing for your hurt,
         your wound is incurable.
     All who hear of your fate clap their hands in joy,
         for who has escaped your limitless cruelty?'

                                HABAKKUK


*Habakkuk's message*

     The message seen by the prophet Habakkuk.

*(Habakkuk)*


     How long, LORD, have I cried out
         and without you hearing me!
     I cry to you, 'Violence!'
         but you do not help.
     Why do you make me look upon wickedness
         and behold trouble?
     Destruction and violence are before my eyes,
         and fighting and quarrelling.


     Therefore the law is weak,
         and justice is never rendered;
     for the wicked surround the righteous,
         so that justice is perverted.

*(The Lord)*


     Look at the nations, look well,
         be shocked and amazed.
     For I am about to do a work in your days;
         you will not believe it when it is told.


     For I am about to raise up the Chaldeans,
         a nation grim and quick of action
     who sweep over the whole breadth of the earth
         to seize dwellings not their own.
     They bring fear and terror.
         They write their own rules.
     Their horses are swifter than leopards,
         quicker than wolves hunting at dusk.
     From afar they come swooping down,
         like an eagle attacking its prey.
     They all come to do violence,
         a horde like a desert wind,
         they gather up captives like sand.


     At kings they scoff,
         and princes are sport to them.
     They laugh at every fortress,
         and heap up earth to take it.
     Then they sweep on like the wind,
         Their strength is their god.

*(Habakkuk)*


     Are you not eternal, LORD,
         my holy one, who does not die?
     LORD you have appointed them to execute judgment,
         my rock, you have established them to punish.
     Your eyes are too pure to look at evil,
         you cannot condone iniquity.
     So why do you regard the treacherous in silence,
         while the wicked swallows the upright?


     You have made people like the fish of the sea,
         like reptiles that have no ruler.
     The wicked sweep them all into their nets,
         and gather them into their drag-nets,
         and rejoice and celebrate.
     Therefore they sacrifice to their net,
         and burn offerings to their drag-net;
     for by their nets are their portions generous,
         and their food is rich.
     Will they empty their nets continually,
         slaughter nations unpityingly?


     I will take my stand on my watch-tower,
         and station myself on a turret.
     I will watch to see what the LORD will say to me,
         what answer he will make to my complaint.

*(The Lord)*


     Then the LORD answered me and said:
     Inscribe the vision plainly on tablets,
         so that even someone running by could read it.
     Though the vision waits for the time set,
         it hastens to fulfilment and will not fail;
     Though it linger long, wait for it.
         For it surely will come and will not be delayed.


     The strength of the proud fails,
         but the upright lives by their faithfulness.


     Wealth is treacherous,
         the arrogant never have enough.
     They make their desire as wide as Sheol,
         are like death, unsatisfied,
     For they gather to themselves all the nations,
         bring together to themselves all peoples.
     Shouldn't everyone mock them?
         sing a taunt-song against them, and say:


     Woe to the person who amasses what is not theirs,
         and loads them self down with goods taken in pledge!
     Won't your creditors suddenly rise,
         and those who will overthrow you awake,
         and you become their prey?
     For as you have plundered many peoples,
         the survivors will prey upon you.
     You have shed blood and committed violence
         to the earth, peoples and their cities.


     Woe to you who seeks unjust gain for your dynasty,
     who sets your nest on high to be safe from the reach of misfortune!


     You have planned only shame for your dynasty.
     You have destroyed many peoples,
         and brought guilt upon yourself;
     the stone will cry out from the wall,
         and the beam from the timber will answer it.


     Woe to the person who builds a city by bloodshed,
         and founds a town by crime
     while the peoples toil for what fires will consume,
         and the nations weary themselves for nothing!
     This the LORD of hosts has said, and the earth will be as full of
the knowledge of the glory of the LORD as the seas are full of water.

     Woe to him who in fury gives drink to his neighbor
         to make him drunk, and see him naked.
     You are filled with shame, not glory;
         drink yourself and be uncovered.
     The cup from the LORD's hand
         will pass in turn to you,
         and shame will cover your glory!


     For the violence done to Lebanon will overwhelm you,
         the destruction of animals will terrify you,
     because you shed people's blood on the earth,
         destroyed people and their cities.


     What use is an idol?
     A human made it,
         a metal image.
     It cannot speak,
         it cannot teach truth,
     Why does its maker trust it?


     Woe to the person who says to a block, awake!
         to a dumb stone, arise!
     What can it teach?
     It may be set with gold and silver,
         but there is no breath at all within it.
     The LORD is in his holy temple.
         Let all the earth be silent before him!

*Habakkuk's psalm*

     A prayer of Habakkuk the prophet, according to the Shigionoth.

     I have heard, LORD, of your fame,
         I have seen, LORD, your work;
     through the years you have make yourself known,
         in wrath you remember mercy.


     God comes from Teman,
         and the Holy One from the mountain-land of Paran. Selah
     His glory covers the heavens,
         and his splendour fills the earth.
     Before him it is like the light,
         rays he has at his side,
         where his power is hidden.
     Before him pestilence stalks,
         after him plague follows.


     He stands, and the earth trembles,
         he looks, and the nations melt away,
     and the mountains of old are scattered,
         the everlasting hills bow down.
     These are his ways from of old.
     The tents of Cushan are afraid,
         the curtains of Midian tremble.


     Is your wrath, LORD, with the rivers?
         Is your anger against the streams?
         Or your rage against the sea?
     Is that why you ride on your war-steeds?
         Why you mount your chariots of victory?
     Why you bare your bow?
         Why you fill your quiver with shafts?


     You split the earth with torrents.
         The mountains see you and writhe.
     The tempest of waters sweeps by.
         The great deep sends forth its voice,
         and lifts up its hands.
     The sun forgets to rise.
         The moon stands still in its place.


     Your arrows go forth to give light.
         Your glittering spear is as lightning.
     In rage you stride over the earth.
         In wrath you trample the nations.
     You go forth to save your people.
         You go to help your anointed.
     You crush the head of the wicked nation,
         laying him bare from thigh to neck. Selah
     You pierced his head with his spears,
         as his champions storm out to scatter us,
         as they rejoice to devour the poor secretly.
     You tread the sea with your horses,
         while the mighty waters roar.


     I hear, and my body trembles,
         and at the sound my lips quiver.
     My bones begin to decay,
         and my footsteps totter beneath me,
     while I long for the day of distress
         to come upon those who attack us.


     Though the fig tree bears no fruit,
         and there are no grapes on the vines,
     though the olive harvest fails,
         and the fields produce no food,
     though the flock is cut off from the fold,
         and there is no herd in the stalls,
     yet I will exult in the LORD,
         and rejoice in the God who saves me.
     The Lord GOD is my strength;
         he makes my feet as sure as the feet of deer,
         and causes me to walk on the heights!
     To the music director: Use stringed instruments.

                               ZEPHANIAH

     The LORD's message, which came to Zephaniah, son of Cushi, son of
Gedaliah, son of Amariah, son of Hezekiah, in the time of Josiah of
Judah who was son of Amon.

*The Day of Judgment on Judah*


     I will utterly destroy everything
         from off the face of the earth,
             says the LORD.
     I will sweep away human and animal,
         the birds of the sky
         and the fish of the sea.
     I will cause the wicked to stumble,
         and I will cut off humanity from the face of the earth,
             says the LORD.


     I will stretch out my hand over Judah
         and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem,
     and I will cut off from this place the last remnant of Baal
         and the name of the heathen priests,
     and those who worship on the housetops
         to the stars in the sky,
     and those worshippers of the LORD
         who also pay homage to Milcom,
     and those who turn back
         from following the LORD,
     And those who do not seek the LORD
         nor strive to find him.


     Be silent before the Lord GOD,
         for near is the day of the LORD,
     for the LORD has prepared a sacrifice,
         he has sanctified his guests.


     On the day of the LORD'S sacrifice:
     I will punish the officers and the royal princes,
         and all those who clothe themselves in foreign apparel.


     On that day:
     I will punish all who leap over the threshold,
         who fill the house of their lord with violence and deceit.


     Listen on that day, says the LORD:
     A cry will be heard from the Fish Gate,
         and a wailing from the New Quarter,
         and a great din from the hills.


     Those who live in the Mortar wail,
         for all the traders are silenced,
         the money counters wiped out.


     I will search Jerusalem with a lamp,
         I will punish those who are at ease,
     who sit comfortably with their wine,
         who say to themselves,
     'the LORD brings neither prosperity nor calamity.'


     Their wealth will become a prey
         and their houses a desolation.
     Though they build houses,
         they will not inhabit them;
     though they plant vineyards,
         they will not drink wine from them.


     Near is the day of the LORD!
         Near and rapidly approaching!
     Near is the bitter day of the LORD,
         and the scream of the warrior.


     That day is a day of wrath,
         a day of trouble and distress,
     a day of destruction and desolation,
         a day of darkness and gloom,
     a day of clouds and thick darkness,
         a day of the trumpet and battle-cry,
     against the fortified cities
         and against the high battlements.


     And I will bring distress upon the people
         and they will walk as the blind,
         because they have sinned against the LORD,
     and their blood will be poured out as dust
         and their flesh as dung.
     Neither their silver nor their gold will be able to save them. For
in the day of the wrath of the LORD and in the fire of his fury the
whole earth will be consumed. For he will make a speedy end of all the
inhabitants of the earth.

*The Imminent Judgment upon the Nations*


     Be ashamed within yourselves, be ashamed,
         before you become as the drifting chaff,
         before the anger of the LORD comes upon you,
         before the day of the LORD's wrath comes upon you.
     Seek the LORD all you meek of the earth,
         you who obey his law;
     Seek righteousness, seek meekness;
         perhaps you may be hidden in the day of the LORD's wrath.


     For Gaza will be forsaken;
         Ashkelon a desolation;
     Ashdod -- by noon will they rout her
         and Ekron be torn up!
     Woe to those who live by the sea coast,
         people of the Cherethites!
     The word of the LORD is against you,
         Canaan, land of the Philistines!
     I will destroy you so that you will be without inhabitants, and you
will become shepherds' cots and folds for flocks. The sea coast will
belong to the survivors of the house of Judah.They will pasture their
flocks there. In the house of Ashkelon they will lie down at evening.
The LORD their God will be with them and restore their fortunes.

     I have heard the taunts of Moab,
         and the revilings of the Ammonites,
     how they have taunted my people,
         and spoken boastfully concerning their border.
     Therefore as I live, says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel:
         Moab will be like Sodom,
             and the Ammonites like Gomorrah,
         a pile of nettles and saltpits,
             and a desolation, forever.
         The residue of my people will plunder them,
             and the survivors of my nation will inherit them.
     This will they have for their pride,
         because they have taunted and spoken boastfully
         against the people of the LORD of hosts.
     The LORD will terrify them;
         he will reduce all the gods of the earth;
     then all the peoples of the nations will worship him,
         each in their own land.


     You, also, Ethiopians,
         slain by his sword are you!
     And he will stretch out his hand
         against the north and destroy Assyria;
     And he will make Nineveh a desolation,
         dry as the wilderness.
     Herds will lie down in it,
         every beast of the earth,
     Desert owl and screech owl
         will lodge in its capitals.
     The owl will hoot in the window,
         the raven on the doorstep,
         all stripped bare of cedar.
     This is the exultant city which sat secure. The city who said to
herself, I am and there is none else! How has she become a desolation! A
lair of beasts! Every passerby hisses at her, shakes their hand.

*Jerusalem's Deep-seated Corruption*


     Woe to the rebellious and unclean city of oppression,
     She has not obeyed the voice,
         she has not accepted instruction,
     In the LORD she has not trusted,
         to her God she has not drawn near.


     Her rulers in her midst are roaring lions.
     Her judges are evening wolves,
         who leave nothing over until the morning,
     Her prophets are braggarts, faithless men.
     Her priests profane what is holy
         and do violence to the law.


     The LORD is righteous in her midst,
         he does no wrong,
     Morning by morning
         he establishes his decree,
     Light is not lacking,
         an oversight is unknown.
     But the unjust know no shame.


     'I have cut off nations,
         their turrets are destroyed;
     I have laid waste their broad streets,
         so that none passes over them.
     Desolate are their cities without people,
         without inhabitants.'


     I said:
     'Surely the city will fear me,
         she will accept instruction.
     Nothing will vanish from her eyes
         that I have impressed upon her;
     But the more zealously have they made all their deeds corrupt.'

*The Future Vindication and Exultation of Jerusalem*

     Wait for me, is the LORD's message, until the day when I stand up
as a witness, for it is my fixed purpose to gather the nations, to
collect the kingdoms, to pour upon them my wrath and my hot anger; for
by the fire of my fury will all the earth be consumed.
     For then I will purify the lips of all peoples, so that they will
all call on the LORD's name, to serve him with one accord. From beyond
the rivers of Cush my worshipers will bring me offerings.
     On that day you will no longer be ashamed of all your deeds by
which you rebelled against me. For I will rid you of your proudly
arrogant ones, and you will never again be haughty on my holy mountain.
But I will leave in your midst a people humble and poor, and the remnant
of Israel will trust in the name of the LORD. They will not do evil, nor
speak falsehood, and a deceitful tongue will not be found in their
mouth; but they will pasture and lie down, and no one will make them
afraid.

     Cry out with joy, daughter of Zion,
         shout aloud, Israel!
     Rejoice and exult with all your heart,
         daughter of Jerusalem.
     The LORD has put away your adversaries,
         he has turned away your foes;
     the LORD is king in your midst,
         you will fear evil no more.
     In that day it will be said to Jerusalem:
         Fear not!
         Zion, let not your hands grow weak!
     The LORD your God is in your midst,
         a victorious hero.
     He will rejoice over you with joy,
         he will renew his love,
     he will exult over you with singing,
         as on a day of festival.


     I will take away from you your disgrace,
         and put away from you your reproach.
     I will destroy at that time
         all who afflict you.
     I will deliver the lame,
         and gather the outcast,
     I will make them an object of renown
         and fame in all the earth.
     I will do good to you,
         at the time when I gather you.
     For I will make you an object of fame and renown
         among all the peoples of the earth;
     when I bring back your captivity before your eyes.


     This says the LORD.

                                 HAGGAI


*The call to rebuild the Temple*

     In the second year of Darius the king, on the first day of the
sixth month, this message from the LORD came through Haggai the prophet
to Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua the
son of Jehozadak, the high priest:

     The LORD of hosts says:
     The people say that the time has not yet come to rebuild the temple
of the LORD.
     Then this message from the LORD came to Haggai the prophet:

     Is it a time for you yourselves to live in your own well-roofed
houses,
     while this temple lies in ruins?


     The LORD of hosts says:
     Consider your past experiences.
     You sow much,
         but bring in little;
     you eat,
         but you do not have enough;
     you drink,
         but are not filled;
     you clothe yourselves,
         but not enough to be warm;
     and those who earn wages,
         put those wages in a bag with holes.


     The LORD of hosts says:
     Consider your experiences.
     Go up to the mountains,
         and bring wood
         and rebuild the temple;
     then I will be pleased with it,
         and I will reveal my glory.


     The LORD says:
     You looked for much,
         and it came to little;
     and when you brought the harvest home,
         I blew it away.
     Why?


     The LORD of hosts says:
     Because my temple lies in ruins,
         while you shelter in your own houses.
     The heavens withhold the dew,
         and the earth withholds its fruit,
     and I have called forth a drought upon the land
         and upon the mountains,
         and upon the grain and the new wine and the oil
         and upon that which the ground brings forth,
         and upon people and animals,
         and upon all the labor of your hands.
     Then Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel and Joshua the son of
Jehozadak the high priest, with all the rest of the people, obeyed the
command of the LORD their God and the words of Haggai the prophet, as
the LORD their God had sent him to them. They showed proper respect for
the LORD.

     Haggai, the prophet of the LORD, as the LORD commanded him, told
the people: 'The LORD says: I am with you.'
     And the LORD stirred up the spirit of Zerubbabel the son of
Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and the spirit of Joshua the son of
Jehozadak the high priest, and the spirit of all the rest of the people,
so that they came and worked on the temple of the LORD of hosts, their
God, in the twenty-fourth day of the sixth month.

*The future glory of the new Temple*

     In the second year of Darius the king,  on the twenty-first day of
the seventh month, this message from the LORD came to Haggai the
prophet, telling him to speak to Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, governor
of Judah, and to Joshua, the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and to
all the rest of the people:

     Who is left among you that saw this temple in its former glory?
     And how do you see it now?
     Doesn't it seem as though there is nothing there?


     The LORD says:
     Yet now be strong, Zerubbabel,
         be strong, Joshua, son of Jehozadak, the high priest,
         be strong, all you people of the land.


     The LORD says:
     Begin the work, for I am with you.


     The LORD of hosts says:
     When your ancestors left Egypt I made a promise to you,
         and I am still with you.
     Do not be afraid!


     The LORD of hosts says:
     In a little while, I will shake the heavens,
         and the earth, and the sea, and the land.
     And I will shake all nations,
         and the precious things of all nations will come here;
         and I will fill this temple with glory.


     The LORD of hosts says:
     The silver is mine,
         and the gold is mine,
     The later glory of this temple
         will be greater than the former.


     The LORD of hosts says:
     In this place I will grant prosperity.
    This is the message of the LORD of hosts.

*Former displeasure and the new promise of blessings*

     In the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month, in the second year of
Darius, this message from the LORD came to Haggai the prophet: The LORD
of hosts says: 'Ask the priests for a ruling: "If one carries
consecrated meat in the fold of his garment, and with that garment
touches bread, or stew, or wine, or oil, or any food, will it become
holy?"'
     And the priests answered: 'No.'
     Then said Haggai, 'If one who is unclean by reason of a dead body
touches any of these, will it be unclean?'
     And the priests answered: 'It would be unclean.'
     Haggai replied: 'So is this people and so is this nation before me,
the LORD declares, and so is every work of their hands; and that which
they offer there is unclean. Think back from this day, before a stone
was laid upon a stone in the temple of the LORD. How were you? When you
came to a heap of grain expecting twenty measures, there were only ten;
when you came to the wine vat to draw out fifty vessels, there were only
twenty. "I struck all the work of your hands with blasting and blight,
with mildew and with hail. Yet you didn't turn to me," says the LORD,
"Think back from this day, think! From the twenty-fourth day of the
ninth month, from the day when the foundations of the temple of the LORD
were laid, and consider. The seed is in the granary, but the vine and
the fig tree and the pomegranate and the olive tree have not yet brought
forth fruit. From this day will I bless you."'

*Zerubbabel*

     This message from the LORD came to Haggai a second time on the
twenty-fourth day of the month:

     Tell Zerubbabel, governor of Judah:
     I will shake the heavens and the earth;
         and I will overthrow the throne of kingdoms;
         and I will destroy the strength of the kingdoms of the nations;
         and I will overthrow the chariots,
         and those who ride in them;
         and the horses and their riders will come down,
         each by the sword of his fellow.


     In that day,
         the LORD of hosts says,
     I will take you, Zerubbabel, my servant, the son of Shealtiel,
         the LORD says,
     and will make you like a signet ring, for I have chosen you,
         the LORD of hosts says.

                               ZECHARIAH


*The Lesson from the Past*

     In the eighth month in the second year of Darius, this message of
the LORD came to the prophet Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, the son of
Iddo:
     The LORD was furious with your ancestors. So tell the people this
message of the LORD of hosts: 'Return to me,' says the LORD of hosts,
'and I will return to you' says the LORD of hosts. 'Do not be like your
ancestors to whom the former prophets cried, "The LORD of hosts says to
turn now from your evil ways, and from your evil deeds". They did not
heed nor listen to me,' says the LORD. 'Your ancestors, where are they?
And the prophets, do they live forever? But did not my words and my
statutes with which I charged my servants the prophets overtake your
ancestors? And they repented and said, "Just as the LORD of hosts
planned to do to us, according to our ways, and according to our deeds,
so he has dealt with us."'

*The Lord's Jealous Love for Zion*

     In the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month, which is the month
Shebat, in the second year of Darius, this message of the LORD came to
the prophet Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo:
     I saw in the night a man on a red horse, among the myrtle trees
that were in the valley-bottom. Behind him there were horses, red,
sorrel, and white. Then said I, 'My Lord, what are these?' And the
messenger who was talking with me said, 'I will show you what they are.'
And the man who was standing among the myrtle trees answered, 'They are
those whom the LORD has sent to patrol the earth.' And the riders
answered the messenger of the LORD who was standing among the myrtle
trees, 'We have gone up and down through the world and behold, all the
earth is still and at peace.'
     Then the messenger of the LORD said, 'LORD of hosts, how long will
you have no pity for Jerusalem and the cities of Judah with which you
have been angry for seventy years?' And the LORD answered the messenger
who was talking with me with kind and comforting words. So the messenger
who was talking with me said to me, 'Proclaim now that the LORD of hosts
says: I am deeply concerned for Jerusalem. But I am deeply angry with
the arrogant, complacent nations. I was only a little angry with Israel
but they made the suffering worse. Therefore, says the LORD, I am
turning to show mercy to Jerusalem. My temple will be rebuilt in it,
says the LORD of hosts, and a measuring line will be stretched over
Jerusalem. Proclaim again: Thus says the LORD of hosts: My cities will
again overflow with prosperity and the LORD will again comfort Zion and
choose Jerusalem.'

*Destruction of the Heathen Powers*

     Now I looked up and saw four horns. I said to the messenger who was
talking with me, 'What are these?' He answered, 'These are the horns
which scattered Judah, Israel and Jerusalem.'
     Then the LORD showed me four smiths. I said, 'What are these coming
to do?' He answered, 'The horns scattered Judah, so that no one dared
lift their head. But the smiths have come to terrify them, to crush the
horns of the nations which lifted up their horn against the land of
Judah to scatter its people.'

*Promise that Jerusalem Will be Gloriously Restored*

     Then I looked up and saw a man with a measuring line in his hand. I
said, 'Where are you going?' He replied, 'To measure Jerusalem, to see
what is its breadth and length.' Then the messenger who talked with me
stepped forward, and another messenger went out to meet him, and said to
him, 'Run and tell to that young man that Jerusalem will be inhabited
like a village without walls, because so many people and cattle will
live there. For I, says the LORD, will be a wall of fire  her, and I
will be the glory in the midst of her.

     Up! Away! Flee from the land of the north, says the LORD.
     For I have spread you abroad as the four winds of the heavens, says
the LORD.
     Up, escape to Zion, you who live in Babylon.
     This is what the LORD of hosts says to the nations which plundered
you:
     Whoever touches you touches the apple of my eye.
     I will raise my hand against them.
     They will be plunder for their own slaves; and you will know that
the LORD of hosts has sent me.


     'Sing and rejoice, daughter of Zion! I am coming,
     I will live among you, says the LORD.
     Many nations will join themselves to the LORD in that day,
     and will be his people, and he will live among you.
     You will know that the LORD of hosts has sent me to you.
     The LORD will inherit Judah as his portion in the holy land.
     He will again choose Jerusalem.
     Be silent, everyone, in the presence of the LORD,
     because he is coming from his holy dwelling.'

*Purification of the Priesthood and Nation*

     Then he showed me Joshua, the high priest, standing before the
messenger of the LORD and the Adversary standing at his right hand to
accuse him. And the messenger of the LORD said to the Adversary, 'May
the LORD rebuke you, Adversary! The LORD, who has chosen Jerusalem,
rebuke you! Is not this man a brand plucked out of the fire?' Now Joshua
was clothed with filthy garments and was standing before the messenger.
The messenger said to those who stood before him, 'Take off his filthy
garments.' Then to Joshua he said, 'I have taken your guilt from you and
I will clothe you in priestly robes.' And he ordered: 'Set a clean
turban upon his head.' So they set a clean turban on his head, and
clothed him with garments. The messenger of the LORD was standing by.
     And the messenger of the LORD testified to Joshua: The LORD of
hosts says: 'If you walk in my ways, and if you will keep my
instructions, then you will rule my house and keep my courts and I will
give you a place of access among these that stand by. Hear now, Joshua
the high priest, you and your associates who sit before me; for they are
men who are a sign; for I am going to bring forth my servant the Branch.
On the stone that I have set before Joshua, on one stone, are seven
facets. I will engrave it,' says the LORD of hosts, 'and I will remove
the guilt of that land in one day. On that day,' says the LORD of hosts,
'you will each invite your neighbour under the vine and under the fig
tree.'

*The Supporters of the Temple Service*

     Then the messenger who talked with me came again and woke me, as
someone who is woken from sleep. He said to me, 'What do you see?' I
said, 'I see a candlestick, all of gold, with a bowl on its top, and
seven lamps on it. There are seven pipes to each of the lamps, which are
on its top, and two olive trees next to it, one on the right side of the
bowl, and the other on its left side.' I said to the messenger who
talked with me, 'What are these, my lord?' Then the messenger who talked
with me answered, 'Don't you know what these are?' And I said. 'No, my
lord.' He said to me, 'This is the message of the LORD regarding
Zerubbabel: Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, says the LORD
of hosts, will I make the great mountain before Zerubbabel a plain. He
will bring forth the top stones with shoutings of, "Grace, grace, to
it."' Moreover this message of the LORD came to me: The hands of
Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house. His hands will also
finish it. Then you will know that the LORD of hosts has sent me to you.
For who has despised the day of small things? They will rejoice, and
will see the plumb line in the hand of Zerubbabel. (The seven lamps are
the eyes of the LORD that search all around the world.) Again I asked,
'What are these two olive trees on the right side of the candlestick and
on its left side?' Again, 'What are these two branches of the olive
trees, which are pouring out the golden oil through the two golden
pipes?' He answered me, 'Don't you now what these are?' And I said, 'No,
my lord.' Then he explained, 'They are the two anointed ones who attend
the Lord of all the earth.'

*The Flying Scroll*

     Then again I looked up and saw a flying scroll. He said to me,
'What do you see?' I answered, 'I see a flying scroll; twenty cubits
long, ten cubits wide.' Then he said to me, 'This is the curse that goes
over the whole land. Every thief will be banished according to the
writing on one side and everyone who lies under oath will be banished
according to the writing on the other side. I have sent it out, says the
LORD of hosts, and it will enter into the house of the thief, and into
the house of anyone who swears falsely by my name. It will remain in the
midst of his house and will consume it with its timber and its stones.'

*The Woman in an Ephah*

     Then the messenger who talked with me came forward, and said to me,
'Look up and see what is now coming.' I said. 'What is it?' He said, 'It
is a measuring basket, full of the guilt of the land.' A round leaden
cover was lifted up, and there was a woman sitting in the middle of the
basket. He said, 'This is Wickedness.' He thrust her down into the midst
of the basket and he pushed the round leaden cover back on its mouth.
Then I looked up and saw two women, and the wind was in their wings.
They had wings like the wings of a stork and they lifted up the basket
between them. Then I said to the messenger who talked with me, 'Where
are they taking the basket?' He said to me, 'To build her a house in the
land of Shinar. When it is prepared, they will rest the basket there.'

*The War-Chariots of the Lord*

     Again I looked up, and saw four chariots come from between two
mountains. The mountains were mountains of bronze. The first chariot had
red horses. The second chariot had black horses, the third chariot white
horses, and the fourth chariot dappled horses. Then I said to the
messenger who talked with me, 'What are these, my lord?' The messenger
answered me, 'These are the four winds of heaven going out after
standing before the LORD of all the earth. The black horses are going
toward the north country and the white toward the west and the dappled
toward the south country.' The strong horses came out, and were
impatient to patrol the earth. So he said, 'Go, patrol the earth,' and
they did so. Then he cried out to me, 'The horses that went to the north
country will quiet my spirit in the north country.'

*Preparations for the Crowning of Zerubbabel*

     Now this message of the LORD came to me: Take the gifts from the
exiles Heldai, Tobijah and Jedaiah who have come from Babylon and go at
once to Josiah the son of Zephaniah. Take their silver and gold and make
a crown and set it on the head of the high priest, Joshua son of
Jehozadak.
     Tell him: 'Thus says the LORD of hosts: Behold, the man whose name
is the Branch. He will branch out from his place and rebuild the temple
of the LORD. He will rebuild the temple and will sit and rule upon his
throne, receiving the honour due to a king. A priest will stand by his
throne and they will work together in peace and harmony. The crown will
be a memorial in the temple of the LORD for Heldai and Tobijah and
Jedaiah, and Josiah the son of Zephaniah. People from far away will come
and build in the temple of the LORD and you will know that the LORD of
hosts has sent me to you. This will happen if you diligently obey the
voice of the LORD your God.'

*The Lord's Real Demands*

     In the fourth year of the reign of King Darius, on the fourth day
of Chislev, the ninth month, the message of the LORD came to Zechariah.
The city of Bethel had sent Sharezer and Regem-melech and their men, to
entreat the favour of the LORD, and to ask the priests of the house of
the LORD of hosts, and the prophets 'Should I continue to mourn in the
fifth month, separating myself, as I have done for many years?' Then
this message of the LORD of hosts came to me: Tell all the people of the
land and the priests, 'When you fasted and mourned in the fifth and in
the seventh month, for these seventy years, did you really fast for me?
When you eat and when you drink, do you not eat for yourselves, and
drink for yourselves? Wasn't it this which the LORD proclaimed by the
earlier prophets, when Jerusalem was inhabited and prosperous, and her
towns surrounding her and the Negreb and the Shephelah were inhabited?'
     The LORD gave this message to Zechariah: The LORD of hosts says,
execute true judgments. Show kindness and mercy to each other. Do not
oppress the widow or the orphan, the resident foreigner or the poor. Let
none of you devise evil against another in your hearts.
     But they refused to listen, and turned a stubborn shoulder, and
stopped their ears so they wouldn't hear. They made their hearts as hard
as stone so they wouldn't accept the teaching and the words that the
LORD of hosts had sent by his spirit through the earlier prophets. Great
was the anger of the LORD of hosts: I called and they would not hear, so
they call and I do not hear, says the LORD of hosts. I scattered them by
a whirlwind out among nations unknown to them. The land was left
desolate behind them, with no one crossing or returning, for they made
the pleasant land a desolation.

*Promises that the Scattered Exiles Will Return and the Lord's Rule be
Widely Acknowledged*

     Now this message of the LORD of hosts came to me:

     The LORD of hosts says:
     I passionately care for Zion,
     and I am fiercely protective of her.
     The LORD says, I have returned to Zion,
     and will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem
     and Jerusalem will be called, "The City of Truth"
     and the mountain of the LORD of hosts, "The Holy Mountain."
     The LORD of hosts says:
     Old men and old women will sit again in the squares of Jerusalem,
     each leaning on a staff because of old age.
     And the streets of the city will be full of boys,
     and of girls playing in its squares.


     The LORD of hosts says:
     Just because it seems impossible to the remnant of this people in
these days,
     is it also impossible for me? says the LORD of hosts.
     The LORD of hosts says:
     I will rescue my people
     from the land of the east and the land of the west.
     I will bring them and they will live in Jerusalem,
     and they will be my people,
     and I will be their God,
     in truth and righteousness.
     The LORD of hosts says: Let your hands be strong, you who hear in
these days the words of the prophets spoken when the foundations for the
house of the LORD of hosts were laid. For before those days there were
no wages for people or animals. No one could go out or return safe from
enemies, because I set each against their neighbour. But now I will
treat the remnant of the people differently from former days, says the
LORD of hosts.

     Peace will be sown.
     The vine will bear its fruit and the ground will yield its produce,
     and the skies will give their dew.
     I will give the remnant of this people all these things.
     Just as you were accursed among the nations,
     house of Judah and house of Israel,
     so I will save you and you will be a blessing.
     Do not be afraid, but let your hands be strong.
     For the LORD of hosts says: As I planned to do evil to you when
your ancestors provoked me to anger, says the LORD of hosts, and I did
not relent, so again have I planned in these days to do good to
Jerusalem and to the house of Judah. Do not be afraid.
     These are the things that you should do: Speak the truth to each
other. Render peaceful decisions in your gates. Let none of you devise
evil in your heart against one another. Do not love perjury. All these
are things I hate, says the LORD.
     And this message of the LORD of hosts came to me: The LORD of hosts
says: The fast of the fourth month, and the fast of the fifth, and the
fast of the seventh, and the fast of the tenth, will be festivals of joy
and gladness, and cheerful feasts for the house of Judah. Therefore love
truth and peace.
     The LORD of hosts says: Peoples, and the inhabitants of many cities
will come, and the inhabitants of one city will go to another, saying,
'Let us go speedily to entreat the favour of the LORD, and to seek the
LORD of hosts; I will go also.' Many peoples and strong nations will
come to seek the LORD of hosts in Jerusalem, and to entreat the favour
of the LORD. The LORD of hosts says: In those days ten people from all
languages and nations will take hold of the robe of a Jew, saying, 'We
will go with you, for we have heard that God is with you.'

*The Conquest of Israel's Foes*


     An oracle:
     The message of the LORD concerns the land of Hadrach,
     it rests upon Damascus.
     For the capital of Aram belongs to the LORD,
     as the tribes of Israel do,
     and also Hamath which borders on it.
     Tyre and Sidon, for all their wisdom.
     Tyre built for herself a fortress.
     Heaped up silver as dust,
     and gold like the dirt of the streets.
     But now the Lord will dispossess her,
     cast down her rampart into the sea.
     She will be consumed in fire.


     Ashkelon will see and fear,
     and Gaza writhe in anguish,
     Ekron, also for her hope will be put to shame.
     The king will perish from Gaza,
     Ashkelon will remain uninhabited.
     A foreign people will settle in Ashdod,
     and I will humble the pride of the Philistines.
     I will take their blood from their mouth,
     and their abominations from between their teeth.
     They also will be a remnant for our God,
     like a tribe in Judah,
     and Ekron will be like the Jebusites.


     But I will encamp as a guard about my house,
     so that none will pass through or return,
     and no oppressor will pass through them again,
     for now I have seen with my own eyes.


     Rejoice greatly, daughter of Zion!
     Shout aloud, daughter of Jerusalem!
     Look, your king comes to you.
     Vindicated and victorious is he,
     humble, and riding on a donkey,
     on a colt, the foal of a donkey.


     He will cut off chariots from Ephraim,
     and war horses from Jerusalem.
     The battle bow will be cut off,
     and he will speak peace to the nations.
     His rule will be from sea to sea,
     from the river to the ends of the earth.


     And you, too -- because of your blood covenant,
     I have set free your prisoners from the waterless pit.
     To the stronghold will the prisoners of hope return.
     This day I declare, I will restore double to you.


     For I have bent Judah to me,
     like a bow which I have filled with Ephraim like an arrow.
     I will urge your sons, Zion, against the sons of Greece,
     I will make you like the sword of a hero.
     Then the LORD will be seen above them
     and his arrow will go forth like lightning.
     The LORD will blow a blast upon a trumpet,
     and travel on the whirlwinds of the south.
     The LORD of hosts will defend them.
     They will devour and tread down the slingstones,
     they will drink their blood like wine,
     they will be full like a bowl,
     like the crevices of the altar.


     And the LORD their God will save them on that day,
     as the flock of his people,
     as the jewel of a crown
     shining in his land.
     How good and how beautiful will it be!
     Corn will make the young men flourish
     and new wine the young women!

*Victory and Restoration for the Lord's Betrayed but Loyal People*


     Ask from the LORD rain,
     at the time of spring rain,
     from the LORD who forms the storm clouds,
     and the showers of rain he gives to you,
     and green in the field.
     But the household gods speak nonsense,
     and the diviners see lies,
     and relate idle dreams.
     In vain they offer comfort,
     so the people wander like sheep,
     They suffer because there is no shepherd.
     My wrath is hot against the shepherds,
     and on the leaders will I bring punishment.
     For the LORD cares for his flock,
     the house of Judah,
     and will make them his splendid war steeds.


     From Judah will come the cornerstone and the stay,
     from them the battle bow,
     from them goes forth every commander.
     Together they will trample on warriors,
     as on the dirt of the streets in battle.
     They fight, for the LORD is with them,
     putting the riders on horses to shame.


     I will make strong the house of Judah,
     I will bring deliverance to the house of Joseph,
     I will bring them back for I have compassion on them,
     they will be as if I had not driven them away.
     For I am the LORD their God and will answer them.
     The Ephraimites will be like warriors,
     their hearts will rejoice as with wine,
     their children will see and rejoice.
     Their hearts will exult in the LORD.


     I will whistle for them, and gather them,
     and they will be as many as they once were.
     I will sow them among the peoples,
     but in distant lands they will remember me,
     and they will bring up their children and come back.
     I will bring them home from the land of Egypt,
     and from Assyria will I gather them.
     Into the land of Gilead and Lebanon I will bring them,
     until the land overflows with them.
     And when they pass through the sea of distress,
     I will strike down the waves of the sea,
     and all the deeps of the Nile will be dried up.
     The pride of Assyria will be brought low
     and the sceptre of Egypt turned aside.


     I will make them strong in the LORD,
     they will walk in his name,
         says the LORD.

*Fate of Judah's Traitorous Rulers and the Ultimate Deliverance*


     Open your doors, Lebanon,
     so that fire may devour your cedars.
     Wail, pine-tree, for the cedar is fallen.
     Wail, oaks of Bashan,
     for the inaccessible forest has fallen.
     Listen to the wailing of the shepherds!
     Their glory is destroyed.
     Listen to the roaring of young lions!
     Blasted is the thick forest of the Jordan.
     The LORD said to me: shepherd the flock destined for slaughter,
whose possessors slaughter them, and hold themselves not guilty! The
people who sell them say, Blessed be the LORD, for I am rich! And their
own shepherds have no compassion for them. I will no longer have pity on
the people of this earth, says the LORD. I will turn neighbour against
neighbour, and put everyone under the power of a king, and when the land
is devastated I will not rescue them. So I shepherded the flock of
slaughter for the sheep-merchants. I took two staffs: one I called Mercy
and the other I called Union. So I shepherded the sheep. I set aside
three of the shepherds in one month; for I was indignant against them,
and they also were displeased at me. I said, I will not shepherd you.
What is dead, let it die. What is set aside, let it be set aside. And
let those who are left devour one another's flesh. And I took my staff,
Mercy, and broke it, so as to break my covenant which I had made with
all the peoples.
     In that day it was broken, and the sheep-merchants who watched me
knew that it was the LORD's message. And I said to them, 'If it is good
in your sight, give me my wage. If not, don't.' So they weighed out my
wage, thirty pieces of silver. And the LORD said to me, Cast it into the
treasury -- the precious wage that at which I was valued by them! So I
took the thirty pieces of silver and cast them into the house of the
LORD, into the treasury.
     Then I broke my second staff called Union so as to dissolve the
brotherhood between Judah and Jerusalem. And the LORD said to me: Take
again the implements of a worthless shepherd. For I am about to appoint
a shepherd over the land. Those who are thrust down he will not visit.
Those who are scattered he will not seek out. The wounded he will not
heal, the sick he will not make whole, but the flesh of the fat he will
devour and even their hoofs he will tear.

     Woe to my worthless shepherd, who deserts the flock!
     May the sword strike his arm and his right eye.
     May his arm completely wither.
     And his right eye be blinded.

*Jerusalem's Deliverance from Heathen Attack*

     An oracle. This is the message of the LORD about Israel. The LORD
who stretches out the heavens, and lays the foundation of the earth, and
forms the human spirit within people says:

     Look! I am about to make Jerusalem
     a cup of drunkenness for all the surrounding peoples.
     There will be a siege of Jerusalem.
     On that day that I will make Jerusalem
     a stone to be lifted up by all the peoples.
     All who lift it up will surely hurt themselves!
     And all the nations of the earth will be gathered together against
it.


     On that day, says the LORD, I will strike
     every horse with panic and its rider with madness.
     But over the house of Judah I will keep watch,
     though I strike every horse belonging to the peoples with
blindness.
     And the chieftains of Judah will say to themselves,
     'The strength of the inhabitants is in the LORD of hosts their
God.'


     In that day I will make the chieftains of Judah
     like a pan of fire in the woods,
     like a torch among sheaves,
     they will devour right and left all the surrounding peoples.
     But Jerusalem will abide on its own site.
     And the LORD will first give victory to the tents of Judah,
     so that the glory of the house of David, and of the inhabitants of
Jerusalem be not exalted above Judah.


     In that day the LORD will protect the inhabitants of Jerusalem,
     and the feeblest among them will in that day be like David,
     and the house of David like God, like the messenger of the LORD
before them.
     And in that day I will seek to destroy all the nations who have
come up against Jerusalem.


     And I will pour out on the house of David and the inhabitants of
Jerusalem
     the spirit of pity and compassion. They will look on him whom they
have pierced
     and they will lament for him as one laments for an only son.
     They will bitterly grieve for him as one grieves for the firstborn.
     In that day mourning will be as great in Jerusalem
     as the mourning for Hadad-rimmon in the plain of Megiddo.
     And the land will mourn, each family by itself:
     the family of the house of David by itself,
     and their wives by themselves,
     and the family of the house of Nathan by itself,
     and their wives by themselves,
     and the family of the house of Levi by itself,
     and their wives by themselves,
     the family of the Shimeites by itself,
     and their wives by themselves,
     and all the families who are left, each by itself,
     and their wives by themselves.
     On that day a fountain will be opened for the house of David,
     and for the inhabitants of Jerusalem, for sin and for uncleanness.
     And it will be on that day, says the LORD of hosts,
     I will cut off the names of the idols from the land and they will
be remembered no more.
     And the prophets and the unclean spirit I will banish from the
land.


     If any man prophesy any more,
     his father and his mother who bore him, will say to him,
     'You will not live, for you speak falsehood in the name of the
LORD.'
     And his father and his mother who bore him will stab him through
when he is seized by the prophetic frenzy.
     And it will be in that day that the prophets will be ashamed, each
of his vision,
     and will not wear the hairy mantle in order to deceive.
     Each will say, 'I am not a prophet,
     a tiller of the ground am I, for the ground is my possession from
my youth.'
     And they will say to him, 'What are these scars on your back?'
     And he will say, 'The scars which I received in the house of my
friends.'


     Awake, sword, against my shepherd,
     against the man who stands near to me,
     says the LORD of hosts.
     I will strike the shepherd so that the sheep may be scattered,
     I will turn my hand against the little ones.
     In all the land, says the LORD,
     two-thirds in it will be cut off and die,
     but a third will be left in it.
     I will bring the third into the fire,
     and melt it as one melts silver,
     and test it as one tests gold.
     Then they will call on my name,
     and I myself will answer them.
     I will say, 'They are my people.'
     They will say, 'The LORD is our God.'

*The Judgment upon the Heathen and the Exaltation of the Lord*

     A day is coming for the LORD, when your plundered possessions will
be divided while you watch. And all the nations will gather to
Jerusalem, to fight against it. The city will be taken and the houses
plundered and the women raped. Half of the city will go into captivity,
and the rest of the people left in the ruins. Then the LORD will go
forth and fight against these nations, as once he fought in the day of
battle. On that day his feet will stand on the Mount of Olives, (which
is opposite Jerusalem, on the east). The Mount of Olives will be split
into halves, from east to west, by an exceedingly great valley; and half
of the mountain will slide northwards and half southwards. You will
escape through my valley -- the valley between the hills will extend as
far as Azel, and you will flee as you fled from before the earthquake,
in the days of Uzziah king of Judah. But the LORD your God will come,
and all the holy ones with him.
     And in that day, there will be no heat nor cold nor frost, but it
will be constant day -- it is known to the LORD -- with neither day nor
night. Even at evening time there will be light. And on that day living
waters will flow from Jerusalem, half of them to the eastern sea and
half of them to the western sea; in both summer and winter. The LORD
will be king over all the earth. On that day the LORD will be one, and
his name one. The land will be changed to plain, from Geba to Rimmon,
south of Jerusalem, but Jerusalem will be high and inhabited as it
stands, from the Benjamin Gate up to the place of the first gate, and
from the Tower of Hananel to the Corner Gate, and as far as the king's
winepresses. Jerusalem will be inhabited, for never again will it be
doomed to destruction, and its people will abide in security.

     This is the plague with which the LORD will strike all the peoples
who array themselves against Jerusalem: he will make their flesh rot
while they stand on their feet, and their eyes will rot in their
sockets, and their tongues will rot in their mouth. On that day a great
panic sent by the Lord will fall on them. Everyone will seize their
neighbours and attack them. Even Judah will fight at Jerusalem, and the
wealth of the surrounding nations will be gathered up -- gold and silver
and piles of clothing. Plague will fall upon the horses, mules, camels,
and donkeys, and on all the animals in all those camps.
     All who are left of all the nations which fought against Jerusalem
will come up from year to year to worship the King, the LORD of hosts,
and to keep the pilgrim-feast of tabernacles. Whoever of all the peoples
of the earth will not come up to Jerusalem to worship the King, the LORD
of hosts, on them there will be no rain. If the family of Egypt does not
go up nor enter in, on them also will come the plague with which the
LORD will strike the nations. This will be the punishment for the sin of
Egypt and the punishment for the sin of all nations which do not come up
to keep the feast of the tabernacles.
     On that day there will be inscribed upon the bells of the horses,
"Holy to the LORD" and the pots in the house of the LORD will be as holy
as the sacrificial bowls before the altars. Every pot in Jerusalem and
in Judah will be holy to the LORD of hosts and all who sacrifice will
come and take of them and cook the sacrifices in them. There will be no
more traffickers in the house of the LORD of hosts in that day.

                                MALACHI


*The Lord's Love for Israel*

     An oracle. The message of the LORD to Israel through Malachi.

     'I have loved you,' says the LORD. 'But you ask, "How have you
shown love to us?" Was not Esau Jacob's brother?' explains the LORD of
hosts, 'yet I loved Jacob, but hated Esau, and made his mountains a
desolation, and transformed his ancestral land into a wilderness. When
Edom says, "We are beaten down, but we will return and rebuild the
ruined places"' the LORD of hosts says, 'They may build, but I will
throw down. They will be called, "The border land of wickedness," the
people against whom the LORD is angry forever. Your own eyes will see
this, and you will say, "the LORD's greatness reaches beyond the border
of Israel."'

*Against the Priests*

     'A son honours his father and servant their master. If I am a
father, where is my honour? And if I am a master, where is the one who
fears me? So says the LORD to you, priests who despise my name. You ask,
"How have we despised your name?" You offer on my altar bread that is
polluted. You ask, "How have we polluted it?" Because you say, "The
table of the LORD is contemptible." When you offer the blind animal for
sacrifice, "It doesn't matter!" And when you offer the lame and the sick
"It doesn't matter!" Give an animal like that to your governor; will he
be pleased with it? Will he receive you favourably?' says the LORD of
hosts. Now, plead for the favour of God with such an offering, so that
he may be gracious to us. 'Would I receive any of you favourably?' says
the LORD of hosts.
     'If only one of you would shut the temple doors, so that you could
not kindle useless fires on my altar! I have no pleasure in you,' says
the LORD of hosts, 'Nor will I accept an offering from your hand. For
from the rising of the sun to its setting my name is great among the
nations, and in every place they offer to my name a pure offering. For
my name is great among the nations,' says the LORD of hosts.
     'But you profane me when you say, "The table of the LORD is
polluted, and its food is contemptible." You say also, "How tired we are
of all this!" and you sniff contemptuously at it. You have brought the
blind, the lame and the sick as offerings. Should I accept this from
your hand?' says the LORD of hosts. 'Cursed be the cheat, who has in his
flock a valuable male, but vows and sacrifices to the Lord a blemished
animal! For I am a great king,' says the LORD of hosts, 'and my name is
feared among the nations.'
     'Now, you priests, this command is for you. If you will not hear,
and if you do not take it to heart, to give glory to my name,' says the
LORD of hosts, 'Then I will lay a curse on you. I will turn your
blessings into curses. Indeed I have already done so, because you pay no
attention. I will punish your descendants! I will spread offal upon your
faces, even the offal of your pilgrim feasts, you will be discarded. You
will then know that I have sent this command to you, so that my covenant
with Levi may be preserved,' says the LORD of hosts.
     'My covenant with him was to give life and peace. I gave them to
him so that he might revere me. He revered me, and stood in awe of my
name. The true instruction was in his mouth, and injustice was not found
in his lips; He walked with me in peace and uprightness, and turned many
away from iniquity. For the priest's lips should keep knowledge, and
people should seek the law from his mouth, because he is the messenger
of the LORD of hosts.
     'But you have turned aside from that way. You have caused many to
stumble in the law. You have corrupted the covenant of Levi,' says the
LORD of hosts. 'So I have I made you contemptible and degraded before
all the people, because you have not kept my ways, and have had no
respect for me in imparting the law.'

*Unfaithfulness*

     Don't we have all one father? Didn't one God created us? Why do we
deal faithlessly with one another, profaning the covenant of our
ancestors? Judah is treacherous, and abominations are committed in
Israel and in Jerusalem because Judah has profaned the holy things loved
by the LORD, and has married the daughter of a foreign god. May the LORD
banish from the community of Jacob anyone who does this, anyone awaking,
testifying, and making an offering to the LORD of hosts. And you also do
this: You cover the altar of the LORD with tears, because he doesn't
accept the offering any more, doesn't accept it from your hand. Yet you
ask, 'Why?' Because the LORD is testifying against you on behalf of the
wife you married when you were young. You have been unfaithful to her,
even though she is your companion, and your legal wife.
     Did not the one God make everyone, so that all both flesh and
spirit is his? And what does that one God seek but godly children?
Therefore keep watch over your spirit, and let none of you deal
faithlessly with the wife of your youth. 'A man who divorces or puts
away his wife,' says LORD, the God of Israel, 'overwhelms her with
cruelty.' The LORD of hosts says: 'Keep watch over your spirit, do not
be unfaithful.'

*The Lord's Coming Judgment*

     You have wearied the LORD with your words. You ask, 'How have we
wearied him?' By saying, 'Everyone who does evil is good in the sight of
the LORD, and he delights in them.' Or, 'Where is the God of justice?'
     'I am about to send my messenger and he will clear a path before
me: And the LORD, who you are seeking, will suddenly come to his temple.
The messenger of the covenant who you long for is already coming, says
the LORD of hosts. But who can endure the day of his coming? And who
will stand firm when he appears? He is like a refiner's fire, and like a
launderer's soap, and he will sit as a refiner and purifier. He will
purify the descendants of Levi, and refine them like gold and silver,
until they are fit to bring offerings to the LORD. Then will the
offerings of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasant to the LORD, as in the days
of old, and as in former years.
     'I will come to you in judgment. I will be quick to testify against
the sorcerers, adulterers, perjurers, those who cheat workers, or
widows, or orphans, deny justice to immigrants, and do not fear me,'
says the LORD of hosts. 'For I, the LORD, do not change; and you have
not ceased to be descendants of Jacob.'

*Paying the Tithe*

     'From the days of your ancestors, you have turned aside from my
statutes, and you have not kept them. Turn to me and I will turn to
you,' says the LORD. 'You say, "How should we turn?" Can a human rob
God? Yet you robbed me. You ask, "How have we robbed you?" In tithes and
gifts! You -- your entire nation -- are all cursed, because you rob me.
     'Bring the whole tithe into the storehouse, so that there is food
in my house. Test me in this way. See if I will not open to you the
windows of the sky, and pour you out a blessing, until there is more
than enough. I will rebuke for your sakes the devouring locust and he
will not destroy your crops, nor will the vine fail to ripen its fruit
in the field, says the LORD of hosts, and all nations will call you
happy, for you will be a delightful land,' says the LORD of hosts.

*Future Reward of the Godless and Faithful*

     'You have said terrible things about me,' says the LORD. 'You ask,
"What have we said about you?" You have said, "It is useless to serve
God, and what do we gain from the LORD of hosts by keeping his commands,
and walking mournfully in funeral garb before him? So now we call the
proud happy, evildoers thrive: they dare God and escape unharmed."'
     Such things those who revered the LORD spoke to one another, and
the LORD took notice, and a record was written before him of those who
revered the LORD and those who keep in mind his name. 'They will be
mine,' says the LORD of hosts, 'my special possession on that day that I
am preparing. I will spare them as a man spares his son who serves him.
Once again my people will see the difference between the righteous and
the wicked, between the person who serves God and the person who does
not.'
     'The day is coming that will burn like a furnace, and all the proud
and all evildoers will be stubble, and the day that is coming will burn
them up,' says the LORD of hosts, 'leaving neither root nor branch. But
to you who revere my name there will arise the sun of righteousness with
healing in its wings, and you will run free like calves let out from
their stall. In the day when I act you will tread down the wicked, they
will be as ashes under the soles of your feet,' says the LORD of hosts.
     'Remember the law of Moses my servant, statutes and judgments which
I gave him at Horeb for all Israel. I am about to send to you Elijah the
prophet, before the great and terrible day of the LORD comes. He will
turn fathers' hearts to their sons and sons' hearts to their fathers, so
that I will not come and strike the earth with judgement.'

                                  THE
                         GOOD NEWS ACCORDING TO
                                MATTHEW


*The Birth, Parentage and Infancy*

     A genealogy of Jesus Christ, a descendant of David and Abraham.
Abraham was the father of Isaac, Isaac of Jacob, Jacob of Judah and his
brothers, Judah of Perez and Zerah, whose mother was Tamar, Perez of
Hezron, Hezron of Aram, Aram of Aminadab, Aminadab of Nahshon, Nahshon
of Salmon, Salmon of Boaz, whose mother was Rahab, Boaz of Obed, whose
mother was Ruth, Obed of Jesse, Jesse of David the King. David was the
father of Solomon, whose mother was Uriah's widow, Solomon of Rehoboam,
Rehoboam of Abijah, Abijah of Asa, Asa of Jehoshaphat, Jehoshaphat of
Joram, Joram of Uzziah, Uzziah of Jotham, Jotham of Ahaz, Ahaz of
Hezekiah, Hezekiah of Manasseh, Manasseh of Amon, Amon of Josiah, Josiah
of Jechoniah and his brothers, at the time of the Exile to Babylon.
After the Exile to Babylon -- Jechoniah was the father of Salathiel,
Salathiel of Zerubbabel, Zerubbabel of Abiud, Abiud of Eliakim, Eliakim
of Azor, Azor of Zadok, Zadok of Achim, Achim of Eliud, Eliud of
Eleazar, Eleazar of Matthan, Matthan of Jacob, Jacob of Joseph, the
husband of Mary, who was the mother of Jesus, who is called "Christ". So
the whole number of generations from Abraham to David is fourteen; from
David to the Exile to Babylon fourteen; and from the Exile to Babylon to
the Christ fourteen.

     This is how Jesus Christ was born:
     His mother Mary was engaged to Joseph, but, before the marriage
took place, she found herself to be pregnant by the power of the Holy
Spirit. Her husband, Joseph, was a just man and, since he did not want
to disgrace her publicly, he resolved to put an end to their engagement
privately. He had been thinking this over, when an angel of the Lord
appeared to him in a dream.
     'Joseph, son of David,' the angel said, 'do not be afraid to take
Mary for your wife, for her child has been conceived by the power of the
Holy Spirit. She will give birth to a son; name him Jesus, for he will
save his people from their sins.'
     All this happened in fulfilment of these words of the Lord through
the prophet, where he says --

     "The virgin will conceive and will give birth to a son, and they
will give him the name Immanuel"

 -- a word which means "God is with us." When Joseph woke up, he did as
the angel of the Lord had directed him. He made Mary his wife, but they
did not sleep together before the birth of her son; and to this son he
gave the name Jesus.

     After the birth of Jesus at Bethlehem in Judea, in the reign of
King Herod, some astrologers from the East arrived in Jerusalem, asking,
'Where is the newborn king of the Jews? For we saw his star in the east,
and have come to worship him.' When King Herod heard of this, he was
much troubled, and so too was all Jerusalem. He called together all the
chief priests and teachers of the Law in the nation, and questioned them
as to where the Christ was to be born.
     'At Bethlehem in Judea,' was their answer, 'for it is said in the
prophet --

     "And you, Bethlehem in Judah's land,
         are in no way least among the chief cities of Judah,
     for out of you will come a ruler --
         who will shepherd my people Israel."'
     Then Herod secretly sent for the astrologers. He found out from
them the time of the appearance of the star. Sending them to Bethlehem
he said, 'Go and make a careful search for the child. When you have
found him, bring word back to me, so that I, too, can go and worship
him.' The astrologers heard what the king had to say, and then continued
their journey. The star which they had seen in the east led them on,
until it reached and stood over the place where the child was. At the
sight of the star they were filled with joy. Entering the house, they
saw the child with his mother, Mary, and fell at his feet and worshipped
him. Then they opened their treasure chests, and offered to the child
presents of gold, frankincense, and myrrh. But afterwards, having been
warned in a dream not to go back to Herod, they returned to their own
country by another road.
     After they had left, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a
dream, and said, 'Get up, take the child and his mother, and seek refuge
in Egypt; and stay there until I tell you to return, for Herod is about
to search for the child, to put him to death.' Joseph woke up, and
taking the child and his mother by night, went into Egypt, and there he
stayed until Herod's death. This was in fulfilment of these words of the
Lord in the prophet, where he says --

     "Out of Egypt I called my Son."
     When Herod found out that the astrologers had tricked him, he flew
into a rage. He sent and put to death all the boys in Bethlehem and the
whole of that region, who were two years old or under, guided by the
time which he had learned from the astrologers. Then were fulfilled
these words spoken in the prophet Jeremiah, where he says --

     "A voice was heard in Ramah,
         weeping and mourning loudly;
     Rachel, weeping for her children,
         refusing all comfort for they were dead."
     But, on the death of Herod, an angel of the Lord appeared in a
dream to Joseph in Egypt, and said, 'Get up, take the child and his
mother, and go into the Land of Israel, for those who sought to take the
child's life are dead.' He woke up, and taking the child and his mother,
went into the Land of Israel. But, hearing that Archelaus had succeeded
his father Herod as king of Judea, he was afraid to go back there; and
having been warned in a dream, he went into the part of the country
called Galilee. There he settled in the town of Nazareth, in fulfilment
of these words in the prophets -- "He will be called a Nazarene."

*The Preparation*

     About that time John the Baptist first appeared, proclaiming in the
wilderness of Judea: 'Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.'
John was the one who was spoken of in the prophet Isaiah, where he says
--

     "The voice of one crying aloud in the wilderness:
     'Make ready the way of the Lord,
     make his paths straight.'"
     John's clothes were made of camels' hair, with a leather strap
round his waist, and his food was locusts and wild honey. At that time
Jerusalem, and all Judea, as well as the whole district of the Jordan,
went out to him and were baptised by him in the Jordan River, confessing
their sins.
     But when John saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to
receive his baptism, he said to them, 'You children of snakes! Who has
prompted you to seek refuge from the coming judgment? Let your life,
then, prove your repentance; and do not think that you can say among
yourselves "Abraham is our ancestor," for I tell you that out of these
stones God is able to raise descendants for Abraham! Already the axe is
lying at the root of the trees. Therefore every tree that fails to bear
good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire. I, indeed, baptise
you with water to teach repentance; but he who is coming after me is
more powerful than I, and I am not fit even to carry his sandals. He
will baptise you with the Holy Spirit and with fire. His winnowing-fan
is in his hand, and he will clear his threshing-floor, and store his
grain in the barn, but the chaff he will burn with a fire that cannot be
put out.'
     Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan, to John, to be baptised
by him. But John tried to prevent him.
     'I need to be baptised by you,' he said, 'so why have you come to
me?'
     'This is the way it should be for now,' Jesus answered, 'because we
should do everything that God requires.' So John agreed.
     After the baptism of Jesus, and just as he came up from the water,
the heavens opened, and he saw the Spirit of God coming down like a dove
and resting on him, and from the heavens there came a voice which said,
'This is my dearly loved son, who brings me great joy.'

     Then Jesus was led up into the wilderness by the Spirit to be
tempted by the devil. And, after he had fasted for forty days and forty
nights, he became hungry. The Tempter came to him, and said:

     'If you are God's Son, tell these stones to become loaves of
bread.'

 But Jesus answered, 'Scripture says --

     "It is not on bread alone that a person is to live, but on every
word that comes from the mouth of God."'

 Then the devil took him to the Holy City, and, placing him on the
parapet of the temple, said to him, 'If you are God's Son, throw
yourself down, for scripture says --

     "He will give his angels commands about you,
     and on their hands they will lift you up,
     so you do not even strike your foot against a stone."'

 'Scripture also says,' answered Jesus,

     '"You must not tempt the Lord your God."'

 The third time, the devil took Jesus to a very high mountain, and,
showing him all the kingdoms of the world and their splendour, said to
him:

     'All these I will give you, if you will fall at my feet and worship
me.'

 Then Jesus said to him, 'Go away, Satan! For scripture says --

     "You must worship the Lord your God, and worship him only."'

 Then the devil left him alone, and angels came and helped him.

*The Work in Galilee*

     When Jesus heard that John had been arrested, he returned to
Galilee. Afterwards, leaving Nazareth, he went and settled at Capernaum,
which is by the side of the sea, within the borders of Zebulun and
Naphtali; in fulfilment of these words in the prophet Isaiah --

     "The land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali,
     the land of the Road by the sea, and beyond the Jordan,
         with Galilee of the Gentiles --
     The people who were living in darkness
         have seen a great light,
     and, for those who were living in the shadow-land of death,
         a light has dawned!"

     At that time Jesus began to proclaim --

     'Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.'
     As Jesus was walking along the shore of the Sea of Galilee, he saw
two brothers -- Simon, also known as Peter, and his brother Andrew --
casting a net into the sea; for they were fishermen.
     'Come and follow me,' Jesus said, 'and I will teach you to fish for
people.' The two men left their nets at once and followed him. Going
further on, he saw two other men who were also brothers, James,
Zebedee's son, and his brother John, in their boat with their father,
mending their nets. Jesus called them, and they at once left their boat
and their father, and followed him.
     Jesus went all through Galilee, teaching in their synagogues,
proclaiming the good news of the kingdom, and curing every kind of
disease and every kind of sickness among the people; and his fame spread
all through Syria. They brought to him all who were ill with any form of
disease, or who were suffering pain -- any who were either possessed by
demons, or were lunatic, or paralysed; and he cured them. He was
followed by large crowds from Galilee, the district of the Ten Towns,
Jerusalem, Judea, and from beyond the Jordan.
     On seeing the crowds of people, Jesus went up the hill; and, when
he had taken his seat, his disciples came up to him; and he began to
teach them, saying:

     'Blessed are the poor in spirit,
         for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
     Blessed are the mourners,
         for they will be comforted.
     Blessed are the gentle,
         for they will inherit the earth.
     Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness,
         for they will be satisfied.
     Blessed are the merciful,
         for they will find mercy.
     Blessed are the pure in heart,
         for they will see God.
     Blessed are the peacemakers,
         for they will be called children of God.
     Blessed are those who have been persecuted in the cause of
righteousness,
         for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.

 'Blessed are you when people insult you, and persecute you, and say all
kinds of evil lies about you because of me. Be glad and rejoice, because
your reward in heaven will be great; this is the way they persecuted the
prophets who lived before you.
     'You are salt for the world. But if salt becomes tasteless, how can
it be made salty again? It is no longer good for anything, but is thrown
away, and trampled underfoot. It is you who are the light of the world.
A town that stands on a hill cannot be hidden. People do not light a
lamp and put it under a basket, but on the lamp-stand, where it gives
light to everyone in the house. Let your light so shine before the eyes
of others so that, seeing your good actions, they will praise your
Father who is in heaven.
     'Do not think that I have come to do away with the Law or the
prophets; I have not come to do away with them, but to complete them.
For I tell you, until the heavens and the earth disappear, not even the
smallest letter, nor one stroke of a letter, will disappear from the Law
until all is done. Whoever, therefore, breaks one of these commandments,
even the least of them, and teaches others to do so, will be the least
esteemed in the kingdom of heaven; but whoever keeps them, and teaches
others to do so, will be esteemed great in the kingdom of heaven. Indeed
I tell you that, unless you obey God's commands better than of the
teachers of the Law, and Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of
heaven.
     'You have heard that to our ancestors it was said -- "You must not
commit murder," and "Whoever commits murder will be brought to trial."
But I say to you that anyone who is angry at their brother or sister
will be brought to trial; and whoever insults their brother or sister
will be brought before the High Council, while whoever calls them a fool
will be in danger of the fires of Gehenna. Therefore, when presenting
your gift at the altar, if even there you remember that your brother or
sister has something against you, leave your gift there, before the
altar, go and be reconciled to them, first, then come and present your
gift. Be ready to make friends with your opponent, even when you meet
them on your way to the court; otherwise they might hand you over to the
judge, and the judge to the judicial officer, and you will be thrown
into prison. I tell you, you will not come out until you have paid the
last cent.
     'You have heard that it was said -- "You must not commit adultery."
But I say to you that anyone who looks at a woman and desires her has
already committed adultery with her in his heart. If your right eye
causes you to sin, take it out and throw it away. It would be best for
you to lose one part of your body, and not to have the whole of it
thrown into Gehenna. And, if your right hand causes you to sin, cut it
off and throw it away. It would be best for you to lose one part of your
body, and not to have the whole of it go down to Gehenna.
     'It was also said -- "Let anyone who divorces his wife serve her
with a notice of separation." But I say to you that anyone who divorces
his wife, except on the ground of some serious sexual sin, leads to her
committing adultery; while anyone who marries her after her divorce is
guilty of adultery. Again, you have heard that our ancestors were told
-- "Do not break your oaths, keep your vows to the Lord." But I say to
you that you must not swear at all, either by heaven, since that is
God's throne, or by the earth, since that is his footstool, or by
Jerusalem, since that is the city of the Great King. Nor should you
swear by your head, since you cannot make a single hair either white or
black. Let your words be simply "Yes" or "No"; anything beyond this
comes from what is evil.
     'You have heard that it was said -- "An eye for an eye and a tooth
for a tooth." But I say to you that you must not resist those who wrong
you; but, if anyone strikes you on the right cheek, turn the other to
them also. If someone sues you for your shirt, let them have your cloak
as well. If you are forced to carry a soldier's pack for one mile, carry
it two. Give to anyone who asks and, if someone wants to borrow from
you, do not turn them away.
     You have heard that it was said -- "You must love your neighbour
and hate your enemy." But what I tell you is this: love your enemies,
and pray for those who persecute you, so that you may become children of
your Father who is in heaven; for he causes his sun to rise on bad and
good alike, and sends rain on the righteous and on the unrighteous. For,
if you love only those who love you, what reward will you have? Even the
tax collectors do this! And, if you only welcome your brothers and
sisters, what are you doing more than others? Even the Gentiles do this!
You, then, must become perfect -- as your heavenly Father is perfect.
     'Take care not to perform your religious duties in public in order
to be seen by others; if you do, your Father who is in heaven has no
reward for you. Therefore, when you do acts of charity, do not have a
trumpet blown in front of you, as hypocrites do in the synagogues and in
the streets so that people will praise them. There, I tell you, is their
reward! But, when you do acts of charity, do not let your left hand know
what your right hand is doing, so that your charity may be secret; and
your Father, who sees what is in secret, will reward you.
     'And, when you pray, you are not to behave as hypocrites do. They
like to pray standing in the synagogues and at the corners of the
streets, so that people will see them. There, I tell you, is their
reward! But, when one of you prays, they should go into their own room,
shut the door, and pray to their Father who dwells in secret; and their
Father, who sees what is secret, will reward them. When praying, do not
repeat the same words over and over again, as is done by the Gentiles,
who think that by using many words they will obtain a hearing. Do not
imitate them; for God, your Father, knows what you need before you ask
him. You, therefore, should pray like this --

     "Our Father, who is in heaven,
     may your name be held holy,
     your kingdom come, your will be done --
         on earth, as in heaven.
     Give us today
         the bread that we will need;
     and forgive us our wrongdoings,
         as we have forgiven those who have wronged us;
     and take us not into temptation,
         but deliver us from evil."

 For, if you forgive others their offences, your heavenly Father will
forgive you also; but, if you do not forgive others their offences, not
even your Father will forgive your offences.
     'And, when you fast, do not put on gloomy looks, as hypocrites do
who disfigure their faces so that they may be seen by people to be
fasting. That, I tell you, is their reward! But, when one of you fasts,
they should anoint their head and wash their face, so that they may not
be seen by people to be fasting, but by their Father who dwells in
secret; and their Father, who sees what is secret, will reward them.
     'Do not store up treasures for yourselves on earth, where moth and
rust destroy, and where thieves break in and steal. But store up
treasures for yourselves in heaven, where neither moth nor rust
destroys, and where thieves do not break in or steal. For where your
treasure is, there will your heart be also. The lamp of the body is the
eye. If your eye is unclouded, your whole body will be lit up; but, if
your eye is diseased, your whole body will be darkened. And, if the
inner light is darkness, how intense must that darkness be! No one can
serve two masters, for either they will hate one and love the other, or
else they will attach themselves to one and despise the other. You
cannot serve both God and Money.
     'This is why I say to you, Do not be anxious about your life --
what you can get to eat or drink, or about your body -- what you can get
to wear. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothing?
Look at the wild birds -- they neither sow, nor reap, nor gather into
barns; and yet your heavenly Father feeds them! Aren't you more precious
than they? But which of you, by being anxious, can prolong their life a
single moment? And why be anxious about clothing? Study the wild lilies,
and how they grow. They neither toil nor spin; yet I tell you that even
Solomon in all his splendour was not robed like one of these. If God so
clothes even the grass of the field, which is living today and tomorrow
will be thrown into the oven, won't he much more clothe you, you of
little faith? Do not then ask anxiously "What can we get to eat?" or
"What can we get to drink?" or "What can we get to wear?" All these are
the things for which the nations are seeking, and your heavenly Father
knows that you need them all. But first seek his kingdom and the
righteousness that he requires, and then all these things will be added
for you. Therefore do not be anxious about tomorrow, for tomorrow will
bring its own anxieties. Every day has trouble enough of its own.
     'Do not judge and you will not be judged. For, just as you judge
others, you will yourselves be judged, and the standard that you use
will be used for you. Why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your
friend's eye, while you pay no attention at all to the plank of wood in
yours? How will you say to your friend "Let me take out the speck from
your eye," when all the time there is a plank in your own? Hypocrite!
Take out the plank from your own eye first, and then you will see
clearly how to take out the speck from your friend's.
     'Do not give what is sacred to dogs; they will turn and maul you.
Do not throw your pearls before pigs; they will trample them underfoot.
Ask, and it will be given to you; search, and you will find; knock, and
the door will be opened to you. For the person who asks receives, the
person who searches finds, and the door will be opened to the person who
knocks. Who among you, when their child asks them for bread, will give
them a stone, or when they ask for a fish, will give them a snake? If
you, then, wicked though you are, know how to give good gifts to your
children, how much more will your Father who is in heaven give what is
good to those who ask him!
     'Do to others whatever you would wish them to do to you; for that
is the teaching of both the Law and the prophets. Go in by the small
gate. The road that leads to destruction is broad and spacious, and many
go in by it. For the gate is small, and the road narrow, that leads to
life, and there are few who find it.
     'Beware of false teachers -- people who come to you in the guise of
sheep, but at heart they are ravenous wolves. By the fruit of their
lives you will know them. Do people pick grapes from thorn bushes, or
figs from thistles? So, too, every sound tree bears good fruit, while a
worthless tree bears bad fruit. A sound tree cannot produce bad fruit,
nor can a worthless tree bear good fruit. Every tree that fails to bear
good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire. So it is by the fruit
of their lives that you will know such people. Not everyone who says to
me "Master! Master!" will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only he who
does the will of my Father who is in heaven. On that day many will say
to me "Master, Master, was not it in your name that we taught, and in
your name that we drove out demons, and in your name that we did many
miracles?" And then I will say to them plainly "I never knew you. Go
from my presence, you who live in sin."
     'Everyone, therefore, who listens to this teaching of mine and acts
on it may be compared to a prudent person, who built their house on the
rock. The rain poured down, the rivers rose, the winds blew and beat on
that house, but it did not fall, for its foundations were on the rock.
Everyone who listens to this teaching of mine and does not act on it may
be compared to a foolish person, who built their house on the sand. The
rain poured down, the rivers rose, the winds blew and struck against
that house, and it fell with a great crash.'
     By the time that Jesus had finished speaking, the crowd was filled
with amazement at his teaching. For he taught them like one who had
authority, and not like their teachers of the Law.

     When Jesus had come down from the hill, great crowds followed him.
He saw a leper who came up, and bowed to the ground before him, and
said, 'Master, if only you are willing, you are able to make me clean.'
Stretching out his hand, Jesus touched him, saying as he did so, 'I am
willing; become clean.' Instantly he was made clean from his leprosy;
and then Jesus said to him, 'Be careful not to say a word to anyone, but
go and show yourself to the priest, and offer the gift directed by
Moses, as evidence of your cure.' After Jesus had entered Capernaum, a
centurion in the Roman army came up to him, entreating his help. 'Sir,'
he said, 'my manservant is lying ill at my house with a stroke of
paralysis, and is suffering terribly.'
     'I will come and cure him,' answered Jesus. 'Sir,' the centurion
went on, 'I am unworthy to receive you under my roof; but only speak,
and my manservant will be cured. For I myself am a man under the orders
of others, with soldiers under me; and, if I say to one of them "Go," he
goes, and to another "Come," he comes, and to my slave "Do this," he
does it.' Jesus was surprised to hear this, and said to those who were
following him, 'Never I tell you, in any Israelite have I met with such
faith as this! Yes, and many will come in from East and West and take
their places beside Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven;
while the heirs to the kingdom will be banished into the darkness
outside; there, there will be weeping and grinding of teeth.' Then Jesus
said to the centurion, 'Go now, and it will be according to your faith.'
And the man was cured that very hour.
     When Jesus went into Peter's house, he saw Peter's mother-in-law
prostrated with fever. On his taking her hand, the fever left her, and
she rose and began to take care of him. In the evening the people
brought to Jesus many who were possessed by demons; and he drove out the
spirits with a word, and cured all who were ill, in fulfilment of these
words in the prophet Isaiah -- "He took our infirmities on himself, and
bore the burden of our diseases."
     Seeing a crowd round him, Jesus gave orders to go across. A teacher
of the Law came up to him, and said, 'Teacher, I will follow you
wherever you go.'
     'Foxes have holes,' answered Jesus, 'and wild birds their nests,
but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head.' 'Master,' said another,
who was a disciple, 'let me first go and bury my father.' But Jesus
answered, 'Follow me, and leave the dead to bury their dead.' Then he
got into the boat, followed by his disciples. Suddenly so great a storm
came up on the sea, that the waves broke right over the boat. But Jesus
was asleep; and the disciples came and roused him. 'Master,' they cried,
'save us; we are lost!'
     'Why are you so timid?' he said. 'You of little faith!' Then Jesus
rose and rebuked the winds and the sea, and a great calm followed. The
men were amazed, and exclaimed, 'What kind of man is this, that even the
winds and the sea obey him!'
     On getting to the other side -- the region of the Gadarenes --
Jesus met two men who were possessed by demons, coming out of the tombs.
They were so violent that no one was able to pass that way. Suddenly
they shrieked out, 'What do you want with us, Son of God? Have you come
here to torment us before our time?' A long way off, there was a herd of
many pigs, feeding; and the foul spirits began begging Jesus, 'If you
drive us out, send us into the herd of pigs.'
     'Go,' he said. The spirits came out, and entered the pigs; and the
whole herd rushed down the steep slope into the sea, and died in the
water. At this the men who tended them ran away and went to the town,
carrying the news of all that had occurred, and of what had happened to
the possessed men. At the news the whole town went out to meet Jesus,
and, when they saw him, they entreated him to go away from their region.
     Afterwards Jesus got into a boat, and, crossing over, came to his
own city. There some people brought to him a paralysed man on a bed.
When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the man, 'Courage, child! Your
sins are forgiven.' Then some of the teachers of the Law said to
themselves, 'This man is blaspheming!' Knowing their thoughts, Jesus
exclaimed, 'Why do you cherish such wicked thoughts? Which, I ask, is
the easier? -- to say "Your sins are forgiven"? Or to say "Get up, and
walk"? But to show you that the Son of Man has power on earth to forgive
sins' -- then he said to the paralysed man -- 'Get up, take up your bed,
and return to your home.' The man got up and went to his home. When the
crowd saw this, they were awe-struck, and praised God for giving such
power to human beings.
     As Jesus went along, he saw a man, called Matthew, sitting in the
tax office, and said to him, 'Follow me.' Matthew got up and followed
him.
     And, later on, when he was having dinner in the house, a number of
tax collectors and outcasts came in and took their places at the table
with Jesus and his disciples. When the Pharisees saw this, they said to
his disciples, 'Why does your teacher eat in the company of tax
collectors and outcasts?' On hearing this, Jesus said, 'It is not those
who are healthy who need a doctor, but those who are ill. Go and learn
what this means -- "I desire mercy, and not sacrifice"; for I did not
come to call the religious, but the outcast.' Then John's disciples came
to Jesus, and asked, 'Why do we and the Pharisees fast while your
disciples do not?' Jesus answered, 'Can the groom's friends mourn as
long as the groom is with them? But the days will come, when the groom
will be taken away from them, and they will fast then. Nobody ever puts
a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment; for such a patch tears away
from the garment, and a worse tear is made. Nor do people put new wine
into old wine-skins; for, if they do, the skins burst, and the wine runs
out, and the skins are lost; but they put new wine into fresh skins, and
so both are preserved.'
     While Jesus was saying this, a synagogue leader came up and bowed
to the ground before him. 'My daughter,' he said, 'has just died; but
come and place your hand on her, and she will be restored to life.' So
Jesus rose and followed him, and his disciples went also. But meanwhile
a woman, who had been suffering from haemorrhage for twelve years, came
up behind and touched the tassel of his cloak. 'If I only touch his
cloak,' she said to herself, 'I will get well.' Turning and seeing her,
Jesus said, 'Courage, daughter! Your faith has delivered you.' And at
that very moment she became well. When Jesus reached the leader's house,
seeing the flute players, and a number of people all in confusion, he
said, 'Go away, the little girl is not dead; she is asleep.' They began
to laugh at him; but, when the people had been sent out, Jesus went in,
and took the little girl's hand, and she rose. The report of this spread
through all that part of the country.
     As Jesus was passing on from there, he was followed by two blind
men, who kept calling out, 'Take pity on us, Son of David!' When he had
gone indoors, the blind men came up to him; and Jesus asked them, 'Do
you believe that I am able to do this?' 'Yes, Master!' they answered.
Then he touched their eyes, and said, 'It will be according to your
faith.' Then their eyes were opened. Jesus sternly cautioned them. 'See
that no one knows of it,' he said. But the men went out, and spread the
news about him through all that part of the country. Just as they were
going out, some people brought up to Jesus a dumb man who was possessed
by a demon; and, as soon as the demon had been driven out, the dumb man
spoke. The people were astonished at this, and exclaimed, 'Nothing like
this has ever been seen in Israel!' But the Pharisees said, 'He drives
out the demons by the help of the chief of the demons.'
     Jesus went round all the towns and the villages, teaching in their
synagogues, proclaiming the good news of the kingdom, and curing every
kind of disease and every kind of sickness. But, when he saw the crowds,
his heart was moved with compassion for them, because they were
distressed and harassed, like sheep without a shepherd; and he said to
his disciples, 'The harvest is abundant, but the labourers are few.
Therefore pray to the owner of the harvest to send labourers to gather
in his harvest.'
     Calling his twelve Disciples to him, Jesus gave them authority over
foul spirits, so that they could drive them out, as well as the power of
curing every kind of disease and every kind of sickness. The names of
the twelve apostles are these, First Simon, also known as Peter, and his
brother Andrew; James the son of Zebedee, and his brother John; Philip
and Bartholomew; Thomas and Matthew the tax-gatherer; James the son of
Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus; Simon the Zealot, and Judas Iscariot -- the
apostle who betrayed him.
     These twelve Jesus sent out as his messengers, after giving them
these instructions -- 'Do not go to the Gentiles, nor enter any
Samaritan town, but make your way rather to the lost sheep of Israel. On
your way proclaim that the kingdom of heaven is at hand. Cure the sick,
raise the dead, make the lepers clean, drive out demons. You have
received free of cost, give free of cost. Do not provide yourselves with
gold, or silver, or coins in your purses; not even with a bag for the
journey, or a change of clothes, or sandals, or even a staff; for the
worker is worth his food. Whatever town or village you visit, find out
who is worthy in that place, and remain there until you leave. As you
enter the house, greet it. Then, if the house is worthy, let your
blessing rest on it, but, if it is unworthy, let your blessing return on
yourselves. If no one welcomes you, or listens to what you say, as you
leave that house or that town, shake off its dust from your feet. I tell
you, the doom of the land of Sodom and Gomorrah will be more bearable in
the day of judgment than the doom of that town.
     'Remember, I am sending you out as my messengers like sheep among
wolves. So be as wise as snakes, and as blameless as doves. Be on your
guard against others, for they will betray you to courts of law, and
scourge you in their synagogues; and you will be brought before
governors and kings for my sake so that you may witness for me before
them and the nations. Whenever they betray you, do not be anxious as to
how you will speak or what you will say, for what you will say will be
given you at the moment; for it will not be you who speak, but the
Spirit of your Father that speaks within you. Brother will betray
brother to death, and the father his child; and children will turn
against their parents, and cause them to be put to death; and you will
be hated by everyone because of me. Yet the person who endures to the
end will be saved. But, when they persecute you in one town, escape to
the next; for, I tell you, you will not have come to the end of the
towns of Israel before the Son of Man comes. A student is not above his
teacher, nor a servant above his master. It is enough for a student to
be treated like his teacher, and a servant like his master. If the head
of the house has been called Beelzebul, how much more the members of his
household! Do not, therefore, be afraid of them. There is nothing
concealed which will not be revealed, nor anything hidden which will not
become known. What I tell you in the dark, say again in the light; and
what is whispered in your ear, proclaim on the housetops. Do not be
afraid of those who kill the body, but are unable to kill the soul;
rather be afraid of him who is able to destroy both soul and body in
Gehenna. Are not two sparrows sold for a one copper coin? Yet not one of
them will fall to the ground without your Father's knowledge. While as
for you, even the hairs of your head are numbered. Do not, therefore, be
afraid; you are of more value than many sparrows. Everyone, therefore,
who will publicly acknowledge me, I, too, will acknowledge before my
Father who is in heaven; but, if anyone publicly disowns me, I, too,
will disown him before my Father who is in heaven.
     'Do not imagine that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I
have come to bring, not peace, but the sword. For I have come to set a
man against his father, and a daughter against her mother, and a
daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law. A person's enemies will be
the members of their own household. Anyone who loves father or mother
more than me is not worthy of me; and anyone who loves son or daughter
more than me is not worthy of me. Anyone who does not take their cross
and follow in my steps is not worthy of me. The person who has found
their life will lose it, while the person who, for my sake, has lost
their life will find it.
     'Anyone who welcomes you is welcoming me; and anyone who welcomes
me is welcoming him who sent me as his messenger. The person who
welcomes a prophet, because they are a prophet, will receive a prophet's
reward; and anyone who welcomes a good person, because they are a good
person, will receive a good person's reward. And, if anyone gives but a
cup of cold water to one of these little ones because they are a
disciple, I tell you that they will assuredly not lose their reward.'
     After Jesus had finished giving directions to his twelve Disciples,
he left that place in order to teach and preach in their towns.
     Now John had heard in prison what the Christ was doing, and he sent
a message by his disciples, and asked -- 'Are you "the coming one," or
are we to look for someone else?' The answer of Jesus to the question
was -- 'Go and report to John what you hear and see -- the blind recover
their sight and the lame walk, the lepers are made clean and the deaf
hear, the dead, too, are raised to life, and the good news is told to
the poor. Blessed is the person who finds no hindrance in me.'
     While John's disciples were going back, Jesus began to say to the
crowds with reference to John, 'What did you go out into the wilderness
to look at? A reed waving in the wind? If not, what did you go out to
see? A man richly dressed? Why, those who wear rich things are to be
found in the courts of kings! What, then, did you go for? To see a
prophet? Yes, I tell you, and far more than a prophet. This is the man
of whom scripture says -- "I am sending my messenger ahead of you, and
he will prepare your way before you." I tell you, no one born of a woman
has yet appeared who is greater than John the Baptist; and yet the least
in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he. From the time of John the
Baptist to this very hour, the kingdom of heaven has been taken by
force, and people using force have been seizing it. For the teaching of
all the prophets and of the Law continued until the time of John; and --
if you are ready to accept it -- John is himself the Elijah who was
destined to come. If you have ears, listen. But to what will I compare
the present generation? It is like little children sitting in the
market-places and calling out to their playmates -- We have played the
flute for you, but you have not danced; We have wailed, but you have not
mourned. For, when John came, neither eating nor drinking, people said
"He has a demon in him"; and now that the Son of Man has come, eating
and drinking, they are saying "Here is a glutton and a wine-drinker, a
friend of tax collectors and outcasts!" And yet wisdom is vindicated by
her actions.'
     Then Jesus began to reproach the towns in which most of his
miracles had been done, because they had not repented, 'Alas for you,
Chorazin! Alas for you, Bethsaida! For, if the miracles which were done
in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long
ago in sackcloth and ashes. Yet, I tell you, the doom of Tyre and Sidon
will be more bearable in the day of judgment than yours. And you,
Capernaum! Will you exalt yourself to heaven? You will be flung down to
Hades! For, if the miracles which have been done in you had been done in
Sodom, it would have been standing to this day. Yet, I tell you, the
doom of Sodom will be more bearable in the day of judgment than yours.'
At that same time Jesus uttered the words, 'I thank you, Father, Lord of
heaven and earth, that, though you have hidden these things from the
wise and learned, you have revealed them to the childlike! Yes, Father,
I thank you that this has seemed good to you. Everything has been
committed to me by my Father; nor does anyone fully know the Son, except
the Father, or fully know the Father, except the Son and those to whom
the Son may choose to reveal him. Come to me, all you who toil and are
burdened, and I will give you rest! Take my yoke on you, and learn from
me, for I am gentle and humble, and you will find rest for your souls;
for my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.'
     About the same time Jesus walked through the cornfields one
Sabbath. His disciples were hungry, and began to pick some ears of wheat
and eat them. But, when the Pharisees saw this, they said, 'Look! Your
disciples are doing what it is not allowable to do on a Sabbath!'
     'Haven't you read,' replied Jesus, 'what David did, when he and his
companions were hungry -- how he went into the house of God, and how
they ate the consecrated bread, though it was not allowable for him or
his companions to eat it, but only for the priests? And haven't you read
in the law that, on the Sabbath, the priest in the Temple break the
Sabbath and yet are not guilty? Here, however, I tell you, there is
something greater than the Temple! Had you learned the meaning of the
words -- "I desire mercy, and not sacrifice," you would not have
condemned those who are not guilty. For the Son of Man is lord of the
Sabbath.'
     Passing on, Jesus went into their synagogue, and there he saw a man
with a withered hand. Some people asked Jesus whether it was allowable
to work a cure on the Sabbath -- so that they might have a charge to
bring against him. But Jesus said to them, 'Which of you, if he had only
one sheep, and that sheep fell into a pit on the Sabbath, would not lay
hold of it and pull it out? How much more precious a person is than a
sheep! Therefore it is allowable to do good on the Sabbath.' Then he
said to the man. 'Stretch out your hand.' The man stretched it out; and
it had become as sound as the other. On coming out, the Pharisees
plotted against Jesus, to put him to death.
     Jesus, however, became aware of it, and went away from that place.
A number of people followed him, and he cured them all; but he warned
them not to make him known, in fulfilment of these words in the prophet
Isaiah -- "Here is my chosen servant, who I love and who pleases me! I
will breathe my spirit on him, and he will announce a time of judgment
to the Gentiles. He will not contend, nor cry aloud, Neither will anyone
hear his voice in the streets; a bruised reed he will not break, and a
smouldering wick he will not quench, until he has brought the judgment
to a victorious issue, and on his name will the Gentiles rest their
hopes."
     Then some people brought to Jesus a possessed man, who was blind
and dumb; and he cured him, so that the man who had been dumb both
talked and saw. At this all the people were astounded. 'Is it possible
that this is the son of David?' they exclaimed. But the Pharisees heard
of it and said, 'He drives out demons only by the help of Beelzebul the
chief of the demons.' Jesus, however, was aware of what was passing in
their minds, and said to them, 'Any kingdom divided against itself
becomes a desolation, and any town or household divided against itself
will not last. So, if Satan drives Satan out, he must be divided against
himself; and how, then, can his kingdom last? And, if it is by
Beelzebul's help that I drive out demons, by whose help is it that your
own sons drive them out? Therefore they will themselves be your judges.
But, if it is by the help of the Spirit of God that I drive out demons,
then the kingdom of God must already be upon you. How, again, can anyone
get into a strong man's house and carry off his goods, without first
securing him? Not until then will he plunder his house. Anyone who is
not with me is against me, and the person who does not help me to gather
is scattering. Therefore, I tell you, people will be forgiven every sin
and slander; but slander against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven.
Whoever speaks against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but whoever
speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in the
present age, or in the age to come.
     'You must assume either that both tree and fruit are good, or that
both tree and fruit are worthless; since it is by its fruits that a tree
is known. You children of snakes! How can you, evil as you are, say
anything good? For what fills the heart will rise to the lips. A good
person, from his good stores, produces good things; while an evil
person, from his evil stores, produces evil things. I tell you that for
every careless thing that people say, they must answer on the "day of
judgment." For it is by your words that you will be acquitted, and by
your words that you will be condemned.'
     At this point, some teachers of the Law and Pharisees spoke up.
'Teacher,' they said, 'we want to see some sign from you.'
     'It is a wicked and unfaithful generation,' answered Jesus, 'that
is asking for a sign, and no sign will be given it except the sign of
the prophet Jonah. For, just as Jonah was inside the sea-monster three
days and three nights, so will the Son of Man be three days and three
nights in the heart of the earth. At the judgment, the people of Nineveh
will stand up with this generation, and will condemn it, because they
repented at Jonah's proclamation; and here is more than a Jonah! At the
judgment the Queen of the South will rise up with the present
generation, and will condemn it, because she came from the ends of the
earth to listen to the wisdom of Solomon; and here is more than a
Solomon! No sooner does a foul spirit leave a person, than it passes
through places where there is no water, in search of rest, and does not
find it. Then it says "I will go back to the home which I left"; but, on
coming there, it finds it unoccupied, and swept, and put in order. Then
it goes and brings with it seven other spirits more wicked than itself,
and they go in, and make their home there; and the last state of that
man proves to be worse than the first. So, too, will it be with this
wicked generation.'
     While he was still speaking to the crowds, his mother and brothers
were standing outside, asking to speak to him. Someone told him this,
and Jesus replied, 'Who is my mother? And who are my brothers?' Then,
stretching out his hands towards his disciples, he said, 'Here are my
mother and my brothers! For anyone who does the will of my Father who is
in heaven is my brother and sister and mother.'
     That same day, when Jesus had left the house and was sitting by the
sea, such great crowds gathered round him, that he got into a boat, and
sat in it, while all the people stood on the beach. Then he told them
many truths in parables. 'The sower,' he began, 'went out to sow; and,
as they were sowing, some seed fell along the path, and the birds came
and ate it up. Some fell on rocky places, where it had not much soil,
and, because the soil wasn't deep, sprang up at once. As soon as the sun
had risen, it was scorched, and, because their roots were not deep
enough, withered away. Some, again, fell into the brambles; but the
brambles shot up and choked it. Some, however, fell on good soil, and
yielded a return, sometimes one hundred, sometimes sixty, sometimes
thirty fold. Let those who have ears hear.'
     Afterwards his disciples came to him, and said, 'Why do you speak
to them in parables?'
     'To you,' answered Jesus, 'the knowledge of the hidden truths of
the kingdom of heaven has been imparted, but not to those. For, to all
who have, more will be given, and they will have abundance; but, from
all who have nothing, even what they have will be taken away. That is
why I speak to them in parables, because, though they have eyes, they do
not see, and though they have ears, they do not hear or understand. In
them is being fulfilled that prophecy of Isaiah which says --

     "You will hear with your ears without ever understanding,
         and, though you have eyes, you will see without ever
perceiving,
     for the mind of this nation has grown dense,
         and their ears are dull of hearing,
         their eyes also have they closed;
     otherwise some day they might perceive with their eyes,
         and with their ears they might hear,
         and in their mind they might understand,
         and might turn --
     and I might heal them."
     'But blessed are your eyes, for they see, and your ears, for they
hear; for I tell you that many prophets and good people have longed for
the sight of the things which you are seeing, yet never saw them, and to
hear the things which you are hearing, yet never heard them.
     'Listen, then, yourselves to the parable of the sower. When anyone
hears the message of the kingdom without understanding it, the evil one
comes and snatches away what has been sown in their mind. This is the
person meant by the seed which was sown along the path. By the seed
which was sown on rocky places is meant the person who hears the
message, and at once accepts it joyfully; but, as they have no root,
they stand for only a short time; and, when trouble or persecution
arises because of the message, they fall away at once. By the seed which
was sown among the brambles is meant the person who hears the message,
but the cares of life and the glamour of wealth completely choke the
message, so that it gives no return. But by the seed which was sown on
the good ground is meant the person who hears the message and
understands it, and really yields a return, sometimes one hundred,
sometimes sixty, sometimes thirty fold.'
     Another parable which Jesus told them was this -- 'The kingdom of
heaven is compared to a person who sowed good seed in their field. But,
while everyone was asleep, their enemy came and sowed weeds among the
wheat, and then went away. So, when the blades of corn shot up, and came
into ear, the weeds made their appearance also. The owner's servants
came to them, and said "Was not it good seed that you sowed in your
field? Where, then, do the weeds in it come from?" "An enemy has done
this," was the owner's answer. "Do you wish us, then," they asked, "to
go and gather them together?" "No," said he, "because while you are
pulling up the weeds you might uproot the wheat with them. Let both grow
side by side until harvest; and then I will say to the reapers, Gather
the weeds together first, and tie them in bundles for burning; but bring
all the wheat into my barn."'
     Another parable which he told them was this -- 'The kingdom of
heaven is like a mustard seed, which a person took and sowed in his
field. This seed is smaller than all other seeds, but, when it has grown
up, it is larger than the herbs and becomes a tree, so that "the wild
birds come and roost in its branches."'
     This was another parable which Jesus related -- 'The kingdom of
heaven is like some yeast which a woman took and covered up in three
pecks of flour, until the whole had risen.' Of all this Jesus spoke to
the crowd in parables; indeed to them he used never to speak at all
except in parables, in fulfilment of these words in the prophet -- "I
will speak to them in parables; I will utter things kept secret since
the foundation of the world."
     Then Jesus left the crowd, and went into the house. Presently his
disciples came to him, and said, 'Explain to us the parable of the weeds
in the field.' He answered, 'The sower of the good seed is the Son of
Man. The field is the world. By the good seed is meant the people of the
kingdom. The weeds are the wicked, and the enemy who sowed them is the
devil. The harvest time is the close of the age, and the reapers are
angels. And, just as the weeds are gathered and burnt, so it will be at
the close of the age. The Son of Man will send his angels, and they will
gather from his kingdom all that hinders and those who live in sin, and
will throw them into the blazing furnace, where there will be weeping
and grinding of teeth. Then will the righteous shine, like the sun, in
the kingdom of their Father. If you have ears, listen.
     'The kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hidden in a field, which
a person found and hid again, and then, in their delight, went and sold
everything that they had, and bought that field.
     'Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant in search of
choice pearls. Finding one of great value, they went and sold everything
that they had, and bought it. Or again, the kingdom of heaven is like a
net which was cast into the sea, and caught fish of all kinds. When it
was full, they hauled it up on the beach, and sat down and sorted the
good fish into baskets, but threw the worthless ones away. So will it be
at the close of the age. The angels will go out and separate the wicked
from the righteous, and will throw them into the blazing furnace, where
there will be weeping and grinding of teeth.
     'Have you understood all this?' Jesus asked. 'Yes,' they answered.
Then he added, 'So every teacher of the Law, who has received
instruction about the kingdom of heaven, is like a householder who
produces from his stores things both new and old.'
     When Jesus had finished these parables, he withdrew from that
place. Going to his own part of the country, he taught the people in
their synagogue in such a manner that they were deeply impressed. 'Where
did he get this wisdom?' they said, 'and the miracles? Isn't he the
carpenter's son? Isn't his mother called Mary, and his brothers James,
and Joseph, and Simon, and Judas? And his sisters, too -- are not they
all living among us? Where, then did he get all this?' These things
proved a hindrance to their believing in him. But Jesus said, 'A prophet
is not without honour, except in his own country and in his own house.'
He did not work many miracles there, because of their want of faith.
     At that time Prince Herod heard of the fame of Jesus, and said to
his attendants, 'This must be John the Baptist; he must be risen from
the dead, and that is why these miraculous powers are active in him.'
For Herod had arrested John, put him in chains, and shut him up in
prison, to please Herodias, the wife of Herod's brother Philip. For John
had said to him "You have no right to be living with her." Yet, though
Herod wanted to put him to death, he was afraid of the people, because
they looked on John as a prophet. But, when Herod's birthday came, the
daughter of Herodias danced before his guests, and so pleased Herod,
that he promised with an oath to give her whatever she asked. Prompted
by her mother, the girl said "Give me here, on a dish, the head of John
the Baptist." The king was distressed at this; yet, because of his oath
and of the guests at his table, he ordered it to be given her. He had
John beheaded in the prison and his head was brought on a dish and given
to the girl, and she took it to her mother. Then John's disciples came,
and took the body away, and buried it; and went and told Jesus.
     When Jesus heard of it, he left privately in a boat to a lonely
spot. The people, however, heard of his going, and followed him in
crowds from the towns on foot. On getting out of the boat, Jesus saw a
great crowd, and his heart was moved at the sight of them; and he cured
all the sick among them. In the evening the disciples came up to him,
and said, 'This is a lonely spot, and the day is now far advanced; send
the crowds away so that they can go to the villages, and buy themselves
food.' But Jesus said, 'They need not go away, it is for you to give
them something to eat.' 'We have nothing here,' they said, 'except five
loaves and two fish.'
     'Bring them here to me,' was his reply. Jesus ordered the people to
take their seats on the grass; and, taking the five loaves and the two
fish, he looked up to heaven, and said the blessing, and, after he had
broken the loaves, gave them to his disciples; and they gave them to the
crowds. Everyone had sufficient to eat, and they picked up enough of the
broken pieces that were left to fill twelve baskets. The men who ate
were about five thousand in number, without counting women and children.
Immediately afterwards Jesus made the disciples get into a boat and
cross over in advance of him, while he dismissed the crowds. After
dismissing the crowds, he went up the hill by himself to pray; and, when
evening fell, he was there alone. The boat was by this time some miles
from shore, labouring in the waves, for the wind was against her. Three
hours after midnight, however, Jesus came towards the disciples, walking
on the water. But, when they saw him walking on the water, they were
terrified. 'It is a ghost,' they exclaimed, and cried out in fear. But
Jesus at once spoke to them. 'Courage!' he said, 'It is I; do not be
afraid!' 'Master,' Peter exclaimed, 'if it is you, tell me to come to
you on the water.' Jesus said, 'Come.' So Peter got down from the boat,
and walked on the water, and went towards Jesus; but, when he felt the
wind, he was frightened, and, beginning to sink, cried out, 'Master!
Save me!' Instantly Jesus stretched out his hand, and caught hold of
him. 'You of little faith!' he said, 'Why did you falter?' When they had
got into the boat, the wind dropped. But the men in the boat threw
themselves on their faces before him, and said, 'You are indeed God's
Son.'
     When they had crossed over, they landed at Gennesaret. But the
people of that place, recognising Jesus, sent out to the whole country
round, and brought to him all who were ill, begging him merely to let
them touch the tassel of his cloak; and all who touched were made
perfectly well.
     Then some Pharisees and teachers of the Law came to Jesus, and
said, 'How is it that your disciples break the traditions of our
ancestors? For they do not wash their hands when they eat food.' His
reply was, 'How is it that you on your side break God's commandments out
of respect for your own traditions? For God said -- "Honour your father
and mother," and "Anyone who abuses his father or mother must suffer
death," but you say "Whenever anyone says to his father or mother
'Whatever of mine might have been of service to you is set apart for
God,' he is in no way bound to honour his father." In this way you have
nullified the words of God for the sake of your traditions. Hypocrites!
It was well said by Isaiah when he prophesied about you -- "This is a
people that honour me with their lips, While their hearts are far
removed from me; but vainly do they worship me, For they teach but human
precepts."' Then Jesus called the people to him, and said, 'Listen, and
mark my words. It is not what enters a person's mouth that defiles them,
but what comes out from their mouth -- that does defile them!' His
disciples came up to him, and said, 'Do you know that the Pharisees were
shocked on hearing what you said?'
     'Every plant,' Jesus replied, 'that my heavenly Father has not
planted will be rooted up. Leave them be; they are but blind guides;
and, if one blind person guides another, both of them will fall into a
ditch.' Peter spoke up, 'Explain this saying to us.'
     'What, do even you understand nothing yet?' Jesus exclaimed. 'Don't
you see that whatever goes into the mouth passes into the stomach, and
is afterwards expelled? But the things that come out of the mouth
proceed from the heart, and it is these that defile a person; for out of
the heart proceed evil thoughts -- murder, adultery, sexual immorality,
theft, perjury, slander. These are the things that defile a person; but
eating with unwashed hands does not defile a person.'
     On going away from that place, Jesus went to the country round Tyre
and Sidon. There, a Canaanite woman of that district came out and began
calling to Jesus, 'Take pity on me, Master, Son of David; my daughter is
grievously possessed by a demon.' But Jesus did not answer her a word;
and his disciples came up and begged him to send her away. 'She keeps
calling out after us,' they said. 'I was not sent,' replied Jesus, 'to
anyone except the lost sheep of Israel.' But the woman came, and, bowing
to the ground before him, said, 'Master, help me.'
     'It is not fair,' replied Jesus, 'to take the children's food and
throw it to dogs.' 'Yes, Master,' she said, 'for even dogs do feed on
the scraps that fall from their owners' table.'
     'Your faith is great,' was his reply to the woman, 'it will be as
you wish!' And her daughter was cured that very hour.
     On leaving that place, Jesus went to the shore of the Sea of
Galilee; and then went up the hill, and sat down. Great crowds of people
came to him, bringing with them those who were lame, crippled, blind, or
dumb, and many others. They put them down at his feet, and he cured
them; and the crowds were astonished, when they saw the dumb talking,
the cripples made sound, the lame walking about, and the blind with
their sight restored; and they praised the God of Israel. Afterwards
Jesus called his disciples to him, and said, 'My heart is moved at the
sight of all these people, for they have already been with me three days
and they have nothing to eat; and I am unwilling to send them away
hungry; they might faint on the way home.' 'Where can we,' his disciples
asked, 'in a lonely place find enough bread for such a crowd as this?'
     'How many loaves have you?' said Jesus. 'Seven,' they answered,
'and a few small fish.' Telling the crowd to sit down on the ground,
Jesus took the seven loaves and the fish, and, after saying the
thanksgiving, broke them, and gave them to the disciples; and the
disciples gave them to the crowds. Everyone had sufficient to eat, and
they picked up seven baskets full of the broken pieces left. The men who
ate were four thousand in number without counting women and children.
Then, after dismissing the crowds, Jesus got into the boat, and went to
the region of Magadan.
     Here the Pharisees and Sadducees came up, and, to test Jesus,
requested him to show them some sign from the heavens. But Jesus
answered, 'In the evening you say "It will be fine weather, for the sky
is as red as fire." But in the morning you say "Today it will be stormy,
for the sky is as red as fire and threatening." You learn to read the
sky; yet you are unable to read the signs of the times! A wicked and
unfaithful generation is asking for a sign, but no sign will be given it
except the sign of Jonah.' So he left them and went away.
     Now the disciples had crossed to the opposite shore, and had
forgotten to take any bread. Presently Jesus said to them, 'Take care
and be on your guard against the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.'
But the disciples began talking among themselves about their having
brought no bread. On noticing this, Jesus said, 'Why are you talking
among yourselves about your being short of bread, you of little faith?
Don't you yet see, nor remember the five loaves for the five thousand,
and how many baskets you took away? Nor yet the seven loaves for the
four thousand, and how many basketfuls you took away? How is it that you
do not see that I was not speaking about bread? Be on your guard against
the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.' Then they understood that he
had told them to be on their guard, not against the leaven of bread, but
against the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
     On coming into the region of Caesarea Philippi, Jesus asked his
disciples this question -- 'Who do people say that the Son of Man is?'
'Some say John the Baptist,' they answered, 'Others, however, say that
he is Elijah, while others again say Jeremiah, or one of the prophets.'
     'But you,' he said, 'who do you say that I am?' To this Simon Peter
answered, 'You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.'
     'Blessed are you, Simon, Son of Jonah,' Jesus replied. 'For no
human being has revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven.
Yes, and I say to you, your name is "Peter" -- a Rock, and on this rock
I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will not prevail over it.
I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven. Whatever you forbid
on earth will be held in heaven to be forbidden, and whatever you allow
on earth will be held in heaven to be allowed.' Then he charged his
disciples not to tell anyone that he was the Christ.
     At that time Jesus Christ began to explain to his disciples that he
must go to Jerusalem, and undergo much suffering at the hands of the
elders, and chief priests, and teachers of the Law, and be put to death,
and rise on the third day. But Peter took Jesus aside, and began to
rebuke him. 'Master,' he said, 'please God that will never be your
fate!' Jesus, however, turning to Peter, said, 'Out of my way, Satan!
You are a hindrance to me; for you look at things, not as God does, but
as a person does.' Then Jesus said to his disciples, 'If anyone wishes
to walk in my steps, they must renounce self, and take up their cross,
and follow me. For whoever wishes to save his life will lose it, and
whoever, for my sake, loses his life will find it. What good will it do
a person to gain the whole world, if he forfeits his life? Or what will
a person give that is of equal value with his life? For the Son of Man
is to come in his Father's glory, with his angels, and then he will give
to everyone what his actions deserve. I tell you, some of those who are
standing here will not know death until they have seen the Son of Man
coming into his kingdom.'
     Six days later, Jesus took with him Peter, and the brothers James
and John, and led them up a high mountain alone. There his appearance
was transformed before their eyes; his face shone like the sun, and his
clothes became as white as the light. All at once Moses and Elijah
appeared to them, talking with Jesus. 'Master,' exclaimed Peter,
interposing, 'it is good to be here; if you wish, I will make three
tents here, one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.' While he
was still speaking, a bright cloud enveloped them, and there was a voice
from the cloud that said -- 'This is my dearly loved son, who brings me
great joy; listen to him.' The disciples, on hearing this, fell on their
faces, greatly afraid. But Jesus came and touched them, saying as he did
so, 'Rise up, and do not be afraid.' When they raised their eyes, they
saw no one but Jesus himself alone. As they were going down the mountain
side, Jesus gave them this warning -- 'Do not speak of this vision to
anyone, until the Son of Man has risen from the dead.' 'How is it,' his
disciples asked, 'that our teachers of the Law say that Elijah has to
come first?'
     'Elijah indeed does come,' Jesus replied, 'and will restore
everything; and I tell you that Elijah has already come, and people have
not recognised him, but have treated him just as they pleased. In the
same way, too, the Son of Man is destined to undergo suffering at
people's hands.' Then the disciples understood that he had spoken to
them about John the Baptist.
     When they came to the crowd, a man came up to Jesus, and, kneeling
down before him, said, 'Master, take pity on my son, for he is epileptic
and suffers terribly; indeed, he often falls into the fire and into the
water; I brought him to your disciples, but they could not cure him.'
     'Faithless and perverse generation!' Jesus exclaimed, 'how long
must I be among you? How long must I have patience with you? Bring the
boy here to me.' Then Jesus rebuked the demon, and it came out of the
boy; and he was cured from that very hour. Afterwards the disciples came
up to Jesus, and asked him privately, 'Why was it that we could not
drive it out?'
     'Because you have so little faith!' he answered, 'For, I tell you,
if your faith were only like a mustard seed, you could say to this
mountain "Move from this place to that!" and it would be moved; and
nothing would be impossible to you.' {  (17:21)  Some later manuscripts
add: But this kind does not go out except by prayer and fasting. }
     While Jesus and his disciples were together in Galilee, he said to
them, 'The Son of Man is destined to be betrayed into human hands, and
they will put him to death, but on the third day he will rise.' The
disciples were greatly distressed.
     After they had reached Capernaum, the collectors of the Temple tax
came up to Peter, and said, 'Does not your Master pay the Temple tax?'
     'Yes,' answered Peter. But, on going into the house, before he
could speak, Jesus said, 'What do you think, Simon? From whom do earthly
kings take taxes or tribute? From their sons, or from others?' 'From
others,' answered Peter. 'Well then,' continued Jesus, 'their sons go
free. Still, so we don't offend them, go and throw a line into the sea;
take the first fish that rises, open its mouth, and you will find in it
a piece of money. Take that, and give it to the collectors for both of
us.'
     On the same occasion the disciples came to Jesus, and asked him,
'Who is really the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?' Jesus called a
little child to him, and placed it in the middle of them, and then said,
'I tell you, unless you change and become like little children, you will
not enter the kingdom of heaven at all. Therefore, anyone who will
humble themselves like this child -- that person will be the greatest in
the kingdom of heaven. And anyone who, for the sake of my name, welcomes
even one little child like this, is welcoming me. But, if anyone puts
temptation in the way of one of these little ones who believe in me, it
would be best for them to be sunk in the depths of the sea with a great
millstone hung round their neck. Alas for the world because of such
temptations! There cannot but be temptations but sorrow awaits the
person who does the tempting!
     'If your hand or your foot causes you to sin, cut it off, and throw
it away. It would be better for you to enter life maimed or lame, than
to have both hands, or both feet, and be thrown into the fire that never
goes out. If your eye causes you to sin, take it out, and throw it away.
It would be better for you to enter the life with only one eye, than to
have both eyes and be thrown into the fires of Gehenna. Beware of
despising one of these little ones, for in heaven, I tell you, their
angels always see the face of my Father who is in heaven. {  (18:11)
Some later manuscripts add: For the Son of Man has come to save the
lost. }
     'What think you? If a person owns a hundred sheep, and one of them
strays, will the person not leave the ninety-nine on the hills, and go
and search for the one that is straying? And, if they succeed in finding
it, I tell you that they rejoice more over that one sheep than over the
ninety-nine which did not stray. So, too, it is the will of my Father
who is in heaven that not one of these little ones should be lost.
     'If your brother or sister does wrong, go to them and convince them
of their fault when you are both alone. If they listen to you, you have
won them over. But, if they do not listen to you, take with you one or
two others, so that on the evidence of two or three witnesses, every
word may be put beyond dispute. If they refuse to listen to them, speak
to the church; and, if they also refuse to listen to the church, treat
him as you would a Gentile or a tax-gatherer.
     'I tell you, all that you forbid on earth will be held in heaven to
be forbidden, and all that you allow on earth will be held in heaven to
be allowed. Again, I tell you that, if but two of you on earth agree as
to what they will pray for, whatever it be, it will be granted them by
my Father who is in heaven. For where two or three have come together in
my name, I am present with them.'
     Then Peter came up, and said to Jesus, 'Master, how often am I to
forgive someone who wrongs me? As many as seven times?' But Jesus
answered, 'Not seven times, but seventy times seven. Therefore the
kingdom of heaven may be compared to a king who wished to settle
accounts with his servants. When he had begun to do so, one of them was
brought to him who owed him ten thousand bags of gold; and, as he could
not pay, his master ordered him to be sold towards the payment of the
debt, together with his wife, and his children, and everything that he
had. The servant threw himself down on the ground before him and said
"Have patience with me, and I will pay you all." The master was moved
with compassion; and he let him go, and forgave him the debt. But, on
going out, that same servant came upon one of his fellow servants who
owed him a hundred silver coins. Seizing him by the throat, he said "Pay
what you owe me." His fellow servant threw himself on the ground and
begged for mercy. "Have patience with me," he said, "and I will pay
you." But the other would not, but went and put him in prison until he
should pay his debt. When his fellow servants saw what had happened,
they were greatly distressed, and went to their master and laid the
whole matter before him. So the master sent for the servant, and said to
him "You wicked servant! When you begged me for mercy, I forgave you the
whole of that debt. Shouldn't you, also, to have shown mercy to your
fellow servant, just as I showed mercy to you?" Then his master, in
anger, handed him over to the jailers, until he should pay the whole of
his debt. So, also, will my heavenly Father do to you, unless each one
of you forgives his brother or sister from your heart.'

*The Journey to Jerusalem*

     At the conclusion of this teaching, Jesus withdrew from Galilee,
and went into that district of Judea which is on the other side of the
Jordan. Great crowds followed him, and he cured them there. Presently
some Pharisees came up to him, and, to test him, said, 'Has a man the
right to divorce his wife for every cause?'
     'Haven't you read,' replied Jesus, 'that at the beginning the
Creator "made them male and female," and said -- "For this reason a man
will leave his father and mother, and be united to his wife, and the man
and his wife will become one"? So that they are no longer two, but one.
What God himself, then, has yoked together people must not separate.'
'Why, then,' they said, 'did Moses direct that a man should serve his
wife with a notice of separation and divorce her?'
     'Moses, owing to the hardness of your hearts,' answered Jesus,
'permitted you to divorce your wives, but that was not so at the
beginning. But I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife, except on
the ground of some serious sexual sin, and marries another woman, is
guilty of adultery.' 'If that,' said the disciples, 'is the position of
a man with regard to his wife, it is better not to marry.'
     'It is not everyone,' replied Jesus, 'who can accept this teaching,
but only those who have been enabled to do so. Some men are incapable of
marriage because they were born that way, or have been made so by other
people, while there are others who stay single for the sake of the
kingdom of Heaven. Accept this if you can.'
     Then some little children were brought to Jesus, for him to place
his hands on them, and pray; but the disciples found fault with those
who had brought them. Jesus, however, said, 'Let the little children
come to me, and do not hinder them, for it is to the childlike that the
kingdom of heaven belongs.' So he placed his hands on them, and then
went on his way.
     A man came up to Jesus, and said, 'Teacher, what good thing must I
do to obtain eternal life?'
     'Why ask me about goodness?' answered Jesus. 'There is but One who
is good. If you want to enter the life, keep the commandments.' 'What
commandments?' asked the man. 'These,' answered Jesus, -- '"You must not
kill. You must not commit adultery. You must not steal. You must not say
what is false about others. Honour your father and your mother." And
"You must love your neighbour as you love yourself."' 'I have observed
all these,' said the young man. 'What is still wanting in me?'
     'If you wish to be perfect,' answered Jesus, 'go and sell your
property, and give to the poor, and you will have wealth in heaven; then
come and follow me.' On hearing these words, the young man went away
distressed, for he had great possessions. At this, Jesus said to his
disciples, 'I tell you that a rich person will find it hard to enter the
kingdom of heaven! I say again, it is easier for a camel to get through
a needle's eye than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of heaven!'
On hearing this, the disciples exclaimed in great astonishment, 'Who
then can possibly be saved?' But Jesus looked at them, and said, 'With
people this is impossible, but with God everything is possible.' Then
Peter turned and said to Jesus, 'But we -- we left everything, and
followed you; what, then, will we have?'
     'I tell you,' answered Jesus, 'that at the new creation, when the
Son of Man takes his seat on his throne of glory, you who followed me
will be seated on twelve thrones, as judges of the twelve tribes of
Israel. Everyone who has left houses, or brothers, or sisters, or
father, or mother, or children, or land, for my sake, will receive many
times as much, and will gain eternal life. But many who are first now
will then be last, and those who are last will be first.  For the
kingdom of heaven is like an employer who went out in the early morning
to hire labourers for his vineyards. He agreed with the labourers to pay
them the standard daily rate of two silver coins, and sent them into his
vineyard. On going out again, about nine o'clock, he saw some others
standing in the marketplace, doing nothing. "You also may go into my
vineyard," he said, "and I will pay you what is fair." So they went.
Going out again about midday and about three o'clock, he did as before.
When he went out about five, he found some others standing there, and
said to them "Why have you been standing here all day long, doing
nothing?" "Because no one has hired us," they answered. "You also may go
into my vineyard," he said. In the evening the owner of the vineyard
said to his steward "Call the labourers, and pay them their wages,
beginning with the last, and ending with the first." Now when those who
had been hired about five o'clock went up, they received two silver
coins each. So, when the first went up, they thought that they would
receive more, but they also received two silver coins each; at which
they began to grumble at their employer. "These last," they said, "have
done only one hour's work, and yet you have put them on the same footing
with us, who have borne the brunt of the day's work, and the heat." "My
friend," was his reply to one of them, "I am not treating you unfairly.
Didn't you agree with me for two silver coins? Take what belongs to you,
and go. I choose to give to this last man the same as to you. Don't I
have the right to do as I choose with what is mine? Are you envious
because I am generous?" So those who are last will be first, and the
first last.'
     When Jesus was on the point of going up to Jerusalem, he gathered
the twelve disciples round him by themselves, and said to them as they
were on their way, 'Listen! We are going up to Jerusalem; and there the
Son of Man will be betrayed to the chief priests and teachers of the
Law, and they will condemn him to death, and give him up to the Gentiles
for them to mock, and to scourge, and to crucify; and on the third day
he will rise.'
     Then the mother of Zebedee's sons came to him with her sons, bowing
to the ground, and begging a favour. 'What is it that you want?' he
asked. 'I want you to say,' she replied, 'that in your kingdom these two
sons of mine may sit, one on your right, and the other on your left.'
     'You do not know what you are asking,' was Jesus' answer. 'Can you
drink the cup that I am to drink?' 'Yes,' they exclaimed, 'we can.'
     'You will indeed drink my cup,' he said, 'but as to a seat at my
right and at my left -- that is not mine to give, but it is for those
for whom it has been prepared by my Father.' On hearing of this, the ten
others were very indignant about the two brothers. Jesus, however,
called the ten to him, and said, 'The rulers of the Gentiles lord it
over them as you know, and their high officials oppress them. Among you
it is not so. No, whoever wants to become great among you must be your
servant, and whoever wants to take the first place among you, must be
your slave; just as the Son of Man came, not to be served, but to serve,
and to give his life as a ransom for many.'
     As they were going out of Jericho, a great crowd followed him. Two
blind men who were sitting by the roadside, hearing that Jesus was
passing, called out, 'Take pity on us, Master, Son of David!' The crowd
told them to be quiet; but the men only called out the louder, 'Take
pity on us, Master, Son of David!' Then Jesus stopped and called them.
'What do you want me to do for you?' he said. 'Master,' they replied,
'we want our eyes to be opened.' So Jesus, moved with compassion,
touched their eyes, and immediately they recovered their sight, and
followed him.

*The Last Days*

     When they had almost reached Jerusalem, having come as far as
Bethphage, on the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent on two disciples. 'Go to
the village facing you,' he said, 'and you will immediately find a
donkey tethered, with a foal by her side; untie her, and lead her here
for me. And, if anyone says anything to you, you are to say this -- "The
Master wants them"; and he will send them at once.' This happened in
fulfilment of these words in the prophet -- "Say to the people of Zion
-- 'Your King is coming to you, gentle, and riding on a donkey, and on
the foal of a beast of burden.'"
     So the disciples went and did as Jesus had directed them. They led
the donkey and the foal back, and, when they had put their cloaks on
them, he seated himself on them. The immense crowd of people spread
their cloaks in the road, while some cut branches off the trees, and
spread them on the road. The crowds that led the way, as well as those
that followed behind, kept shouting, 'God save the Son of David! Blessed
is he who comes in the name of the Lord! God save him from on high!'
When he had entered Jerusalem, the whole city was stirred, and asked --
'Who is this?', to which the crowd replied -- 'This is the prophet Jesus
from Nazareth in Galilee.'
     Jesus went into the Temple Courts, and drove out all those who were
buying and selling there. He overturned the tables of the money
changers, and the seats of the pigeon-dealers, and said to them,
'Scripture says "My house will be called a house of prayer"; but you are
making it a den of robbers.' While he was still in the Temple Courts,
some blind and some lame people came up to him, and he cured them. But,
when the chief priests and the teachers of the Law saw the wonderful
things that Jesus did, and the boys who were calling out in the Temple
Courts 'God save the Son of David!', they were indignant, and said to
him, 'Do you hear what these boys are saying?'
     'Yes,' answered Jesus, 'but did you never read the words -- "Out of
the mouths of babes and sucklings you have called forth perfect
praise"?'
     Then he left them, and went out of the city to Bethany, and spent
the night there.
     The next morning, in returning to the city, Jesus became hungry;
and, noticing a solitary fig tree by the roadside, he went up to it, but
found nothing on it but leaves. So he said to it, 'Never again will
fruit be gathered off you.' And suddenly the fruit tree withered up.
When the disciples saw this, they exclaimed in astonishment, 'How
suddenly the fig tree withered up!'
     'I tell you,' replied Jesus, 'if you have faith and don't doubt,
you will not only do what has been done to the fig tree, but even if you
were to say to this hill "Be lifted up and hurled into the sea!" it
would be done. And whatever you ask for in your prayers will, if you
have faith, be granted you.'
     After Jesus had come into the Temple Courts, the chief priests and
the elders of the people came up to him as he was teaching, and said,
'What authority have you to do these things? Who gave you this
authority?'
     'I, too,' said Jesus in reply, 'will ask you one question; if you
will give me an answer to it, then I, also, will tell you what authority
I have to act as I do. It is about John's baptism. What was its origin?
Divine or human?' But they began arguing among themselves, 'If we say
"divine," he will say to us "Why then didn't you believe him?" But if we
say "human," we are afraid of the people, for everyone regards John as a
prophet.' So the answer they gave Jesus was -- 'We do not know.'
     'Then I,' he said, 'refuse to tell you what authority I have to do
these things. What do you think of this? There was a man who had two
sons. He went to the elder and said "Go and work in the vineyard today
my son." "Yes, sir," he answered; but he did not go. Then the father
went to the second son, and said the same. "I will not," he answered;
but afterwards he was sorry and went. Which of the two sons did as his
father wished?' 'The second,' they said. 'I tell you,' added Jesus,
'that tax collectors and prostitutes are going into the kingdom of God
before you. For when John came to you, walking in the path of
righteousness, you did not believe him, but tax collectors and
prostitutes did; and yet you, though you saw this, even then were not
sorry, nor did you believe him.
     'Listen to another parable. A man, who was an employer, once
planted a vineyard, put a fence round it, dug a winepress in it, built a
tower, and then let it out to tenants and went abroad. When the time for
the grape harvest drew near, he sent his servants to the tenants, to
receive his share of the produce. But the tenants seized his servants,
beat one, killed another, and stoned a third. A second time the owner
sent some servants, a larger number than before, and the tenants treated
them in the same way. As a last resort he sent his son to them. "They
will respect my son," he said. But the tenants, on seeing his son, said
to each other "Here is the heir! Come, let us kill him, and get his
inheritance." So they seized him, and threw him outside the vineyard,
and killed him. Now, when the owner of the vineyard comes, what will he
do to those tenants?' 'Miserable wretches!' they exclaimed, 'he will put
them to a miserable death, and he will let out the vineyard to other
tenants, who will pay him his share of the produce at the proper times.'
Then Jesus added, 'Have you never read in the scriptures? -- "The stone
which the builders despised -- has now itself become the cornerstone.
This cornerstone has come from the Lord, and is marvellous in our eyes."
That, I tell you, is why the kingdom of God will be taken from you, and
given to a nation that does produce the fruit of the kingdom. Yes, and
he who falls on this stone will be dashed to pieces, while anyone on
whom it falls -- it will scatter him as dust.'
     After listening to these parables, the chief priests and the
Pharisees saw that it was about them that he was speaking; yet, although
eager to arrest him, they were afraid of the crowds, who regarded him as
a prophet.
     Once more Jesus spoke to them in parables. 'The kingdom of heaven,'
he said, 'may be compared to a king who gave a banquet in honour of his
son's wedding. He sent his servants to call those who had been invited
to the banquet, but they were unwilling to come. A second time he sent
some servants, with orders to say to those who had been invited "I have
prepared my meal, my cattle and fat beasts are killed and everything is
ready; come to the banquet." They, however, took no notice, but went
off, one to their farm, another to their business; while the rest,
seizing his servants, ill-treated them and killed them. The king, in
anger, sent his troops, put those murderers to death, and set their city
on fire. Then he said to his servants "The banquet is prepared, but
those who were invited were not worthy. So go to the cross-roads, and
invite everyone you find to the banquet." The servants went out into the
roads and collected all the people whom they found, whether bad or good;
and the bridal-hall was filled with guests. But, when the king went in
to see his guests, he noticed there a man who had not put on a wedding-
robe. So he said to him "My friend, how is it that you came in here
without a wedding-robe?" The man was speechless. Then the king said to
the attendants "Tie him hand and foot, and put him out into the darkness
outside, where there will be weeping and grinding of teeth." For many
are called, but few chosen.'
     Then the Pharisees went away and conferred together as to how they
might lay a trap for Jesus in the course of conversation. They sent
their disciples, with the Herodians, to say to him, 'Teacher, we know
that you are an honest person, and that you teach the way of God
honestly, and are not afraid of anyone; for you pay no regard to a
person's position. Tell us, then, what you think. Are we right in paying
taxes to the Emperor, or not?' Perceiving their malice, Jesus answered,
'Why are you testing me, you hypocrites? Show me the coin with which the
tax is paid.' And, when they had brought him a coin, he asked, 'Whose
head and title are these?' 'The Emperor's,' they answered, at which he
said to them, 'Then pay to the Emperor what belongs to the Emperor, and
to God what belongs to God.' They wondered at his answer, and left him
alone and went away.
     That same day some Sadducees came up to Jesus, maintaining that
there is no resurrection. Their question was this, -- 'Teacher, Moses
said -- "should a man die without children, the man's brother will
become the husband of the widow, and raise a family for his brother."
Now we had living among us seven brothers; of whom the eldest married
and died, and, as he had no family, left his wife for his brother. The
same thing happened to the second and the third brothers, and indeed to
all the seven. The woman herself died last of all. At the resurrection,
then, whose wife will she be out of the seven, all of them having been
married to her?'
     'Your mistake,' replied Jesus, 'is due to your ignorance of the
scriptures, and of the power of God. For at the resurrection there is no
marrying or being married, but all who rise are as angels in heaven. As
to the resurrection of the dead, have you not read these words of God --
"I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob"?
He is not the God of dead people, but of living.' The crowds, who had
been listening to him, were greatly struck with his teaching.
     When the Pharisees heard that Jesus had silenced the Sadducees,
they collected together. Then one of them, a Student of the Law, to test
him, asked this question -- 'Teacher, what is the greatest commandment
in the Law?' His answer was, 'You must love the Lord your God with all
your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind. This is the
great first commandment. The second, which is like it, is this -- You
must love your neighbour as you love yourself. On these two commandments
hang all the Law and the prophets.' Before the Pharisees separated,
Jesus put this question to them -- 'What do you think about the Christ?
Whose son is he?' 'David's,' they said. 'How is it, then,' Jesus
replied, 'that David, speaking under inspiration, calls him "lord," in
the passage -- "The Lord said to my Lord: Sit at my right hand, until I
put your enemies beneath your feet"? Since, then, David calls him
"lord," how is he David's son?' No one could say a word in answer; nor
did anyone after that day venture to question him further.
     Then Jesus, speaking to the crowds and to his disciples, said, 'The
teachers of the Law and the Pharisees now occupy the chair of Moses.
Therefore practice and lay to heart everything that they preach but do
not practice. While they make up heavy loads and pile them on other
people's shoulder's they decline, themselves, to lift a finger to move
them. All their actions are done to attract attention. They widen their
phylacteries, and increase the size of their tassels, and like to have
the place of honour at dinner, and the best seats in the synagogues, and
to be greeted in the markets with respect, and to be called "Rabbi" by
everybody. But do not allow yourselves to be called "Rabbi," for you
have only one teacher, and you yourselves are all brothers and sisters.
And do not call anyone on the earth your "Father," for your have only
one Father, the heavenly Father. Nor must you allow yourselves to be
called "leaders," for you have only one leader, the Christ. The person
who wants to be the greatest among you must be your servant. Whoever
exalts themselves will be humbled, and whoever humbles themselves will
be exalted. But alas for you, teachers of the Law and Pharisees,
hypocrites that you are! You turn the key of the kingdom of heaven in
people's faces. For you do not go in yourselves, and do not allow those
who try to go in to do so. {  (23:14)   Some later manuscripts add: Alas
for you teachers of the law and Pharisees, hypocrites! You devour
widows' property, and pray long prayers just for show! This is why you
will receive a more severe punishment. } Alas for you, teachers of the
law and Pharisees, hypocrites that you are! You scour land and sea to
make a single convert, and, when they are gained, you make them twice as
deserving of Gehenna as you are yourselves. Alas for you, you blind
guides! You say "if any swear by the Temple, their oath counts for
nothing; but, if anyone swears by the gold of the Temple, their oath is
binding them"! Fools that you are and blind! Which is the more
important? The gold? Or the Temple which has given sacredness to the
gold? You say, too, "If anyone swears by the altar, their oath counts
for nothing, but, if anyone swears by the offering placed on it, their
oath is binding on them"! Blind indeed! Which is the more important? The
offering? Or the altar which gives sacredness to the offering? Therefore
a person, swearing by the altar, swears by it and by all that is on it,
and a person, swearing by the Temple, swears by it and by him who dwells
in it, while a person, swearing by heaven, swears by the throne of God,
and by him who sits on it. Alas for you, teachers of the Law and
Pharisees, hypocrites that you are! You pay tithes on mint, fennel, and
caraway seed, and have neglected the weightier matters of the Law --
justice, mercy, and good faith. These last you ought to have put into
practice, without neglecting the first. You blind guides, to strain out
a gnat and to swallow a camel! Alas for you, teachers of the Law and
Pharisees, hypocrites that you are! You clean the outside of the cup and
the dish, but inside they are filled with the results of greed and self-
indulgence. You blind Pharisee! First clean the inside of the cup and
the dish, so that the outside may become clean as well. Alas for you,
teachers of the Law and Pharisees, hypocrites that you are! You are like
whitewashed tombs, which indeed look fair outside, while inside they are
filled with dead people's bones and all kinds of filth. It is the same
with you. Outwardly, and to others, you have the look of religious
people, but inwardly you are full of hypocrisy and sin. Alas for you,
teachers of the Law and Pharisees, hypocrites that you are! You build
the tombs of the prophets, and decorate the monuments of religious
people, and say "Had we been living in the days of our ancestors, we
should have taken no part in their murder of the prophets!" By doing
this you are furnishing evidence against yourselves that you are true
children of the people who murdered the prophets. Go on then, finish
what your ancestors began! You snakes and children of snakes! How can
you escape being sentenced to Gehenna? That is why I send you prophets,
wise people, and teachers of the Law, some of whom you will crucify and
kill, and some of whom you will scourge in your synagogues, and
persecute from town to town; so that on your heads may fall every drop
of innocent blood split on earth, from the blood of innocent Abel down
to that of Zechariah, Barachiah's son, whom you murdered between the
Temple and the altar. All this, I tell you, will come home to the
present generation. Jerusalem! Jerusalem! She who slays the prophets and
stones the messengers sent to her -- Oh, how often have I wished to
gather your children round me, as a hen gathers her brood under her
wings, and you would not come! Verily, your house is left to you
desolate! For nevermore, I tell you, will you see me, until you say --
"Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord!"'
     Leaving the Temple Courts, Jesus was walking away, when his
disciples came up to draw his attention to the Temple buildings. 'Do you
see all these things?' was his answer. 'I tell you, not a single stone
will be left here on another, which will not be thrown down,' so, while
Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives, his disciples came up to him
privately and said, 'Tell us when this will be, and what will be the
sign of your coming, and of the close of the age.' Jesus replied to
them, 'See that no one leads you astray; for, many will take my name,
and come saying "I am the Christ," and will lead many astray. You will
hear of wars and rumours of wars; take care not to be alarmed, for such
things must occur; but the end is not yet here. For nation will rise
against nation and kingdom against kingdom, and there will be famines
and earthquakes in various places. All this, however, will be but the
beginning of the birth pangs! When that time comes, they will give you
up to persecution, and will put you to death, and you will be hated by
all nations because of me. And then many will fall away, and will betray
one another, and hate one another. Many false prophets, also, will
appear and lead many astray; and, owing to the increase of wickedness,
the love of most will grow cold. Yet the person who endures to the end
will be saved. This good news of the kingdom will be proclaimed
throughout the world as a witness to all nations; and then will come the
end. As soon, then, as you see "the Foul Desecration," mentioned by the
prophet Daniel, standing in the Holy place,' (the reader must consider
what this means) 'then those of you who are in Judea must take refuge in
the mountains; and a man on the housetop must not go down to get the
things that are in his house; nor must one who is on their farm turn
back to get his cloak. Alas for pregnant women, and for those who are
nursing infants in those days! Pray, too, that your flight may not take
place in winter, nor on a Sabbath; for that will be a time of great
distress, the like of which has not occurred from the beginning of the
world down to the present time -- no, nor ever will again. Had not those
days been limited, not a single soul would escape; but for the sake of
God's people a limit will be put to them. At that time, if anyone should
say to you "Look! Here is the Christ!" or "Here he is!", do not believe
it; for false Christs and false prophets will arise, and will display
great signs and marvels, so that, were it possible, even God's people
would be led astray. Remember, I have told you beforehand. Therefore, if
people say to you "He is in the wilderness!", do not go out there; or
"He is in an inner room!", do not believe it; for, just as lightning
will start from the east and flash across to the west, so will it be
with the coming of the Son of Man. Wherever a dead body lies, there will
the vultures flock. Immediately after the distress of those days, the
sun will be darkened, the moon will not give her light, the stars will
fall from the heavens, and the forces of the heavens will be convulsed.
Then will appear the sign of the Son of Man in the heavens; and all the
peoples of the earth will mourn, when they see the Son of Man coming on
the clouds of the heavens, with power and great glory; and he will send
his angels, with a great trumpet, and they will gather his people round
him from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.
     'Learn the lesson taught by the fig tree. As soon as its branches
are full of sap, and it is bursting into leaf, you know that summer is
near. And so may you, as soon as you see all these things, know that he
is at your doors. I tell you, even the present generation will not pass
away, until all these things have taken place. The heavens and the earth
will pass away, but my words will never pass away. But about that day
and hour, no one knows -- not even the angels of heaven, not even the
Son -- but only the Father himself. For, just as in the days of Noah, so
will it be at the coming of the Son of Man. In those days before the
flood they went on eating and drinking, marrying and being married, up
to the very day on which Noah entered the ark, taking not notice until
the flood came and swept them one and all away; and so will it be at the
coming of the Son of Man. At that time, of two men on a farm one will be
taken and one left; of two women grinding with a hand-mill one will be
taken and one left. Therefore watch; for you cannot be sure on what day
your Master is coming. But this you do know, that, had the owner of the
house known at what time of night the thief was coming, they would have
been on the watch, and would not have allowed their house to be broken
into. Therefore, you must also prepare, since it is just when you are
least expecting him that the Son of Man will come. Who, then is that
trustworthy, careful servant, who has been placed by their master over
his household, to give them their food at the proper time? Happy will
that servant be whom their master, when he comes home, will find doing
this. I tell you that their master will put them in charge of the whole
of his property. But, should the servant be a bad servant, and say to
themselves "My master is a long time in coming," and begin to beat their
fellow servants, and eat and drink with drunkards, that servant's master
will come on a day when they do not expect him, and at an hour of which
they are unaware, and will flog the servant severely, and assign them
their place among the hypocrites, where there will be weeping and
grinding of teeth.
     'Then the kingdom of heaven will be like ten bridesmaids who took
their lamps and went out to meet the groom. Five of them were foolish,
and five were prudent. The foolish ones took their lamps, but took no
oil with them; while the prudent ones, besides taking their lamps, took
oil in their jars. As the groom was late in coming, they all became
drowsy, and slept. But at midnight a shout was raised -- "The groom is
coming! Come out to meet him!" Then all the bridesmaids woke up and
trimmed their lamps, and the foolish said to the prudent "Give us some
of your oil; our lamps are going out." But the prudent ones answered
"No, There may not be enough for you and for us. Go instead to those who
sell it, and buy for yourselves." But while they were on their way to
buy it, the groom came; and the bridesmaids who were ready went in with
him to the banquet, and the door was shut. Afterwards the other
bridesmaids came. "Sir, Sir," they said, "open the door to us!" But the
groom answered "I tell you, I do not know you." Therefore watch, since
you know neither the day nor the hour.
     'For it is as though a man, going on his travels, called his
servants, and gave his property into their charge. He gave five bags of
gold to one, two to another, and one bag to a third, in proportion to
the ability of each. Then he set out on his travels. The servant who had
received the five bags of gold went at once and traded with it, and made
another five bags. So, too, the servant who had received the two bags of
gold made another two bags. But the servant who had received the one bag
went and dug a hole in the ground, and hid his master's money. After a
long time the master of those servants returned, and settled accounts
with them. The servant who had received the five bags of gold came up
and brought five bags more. "Sir," he said, "you entrusted me with five
bags of gold; look, I have made another five bags!" "Well done, good,
trustworthy servant!" said his master. "You have been trustworthy with a
small sum; now I will place a large one in your hands; come and share
your master's joy!" Then the one who had received the two bags of gold
came up and said "Sir, you entrusted me with two bags pounds; look, I
have made another two!" "Well done, good, trustworthy servant!" said his
master. "You have been trustworthy with a small sum; now I will place a
large one in your hands; come and share your master's joy!" The man who
had received the single bag of gold came up, too, and said "Sir, I knew
that you were a hard man; you reap where you have not sown, and gather
up where you have not winnowed; and, in my fear, I went and hid your
money in the ground; look, here is what belongs to you!" "You lazy,
worthless servant!" was his master's reply. "You knew that I reap where
I have not sown, and gather up where I have not winnowed? Then you ought
to have placed my money in the hands of bankers, and I, on my return,
should have received my money, with interest. Therefore," he continued,
"take away from him the one bag of gold, and give it to the one who has
the ten bags. For, to him who has, more will be given, and he will have
abundance; but, as for him who has nothing, even what he has will be
taken away from him. As for the useless servant, put him out into the
darkness outside, where there will be weeping and grinding of teeth."
     'When the Son of Man has come in his glory and all the angels with
him, then he will take his seat on his throne of glory; and all the
nations will be gathered before him, and he will separate the people --
just as a shepherd separates sheep from goats -- placing the sheep on
his right hand, and the goats on his left. Then the king will say to
those on his right "Come, you who are blessed by my Father, enter into
possession of the kingdom prepared for you ever since the beginning of
the world. For, when I was hungry, you gave me food; when I was thirsty,
you gave me drink; when I was a stranger, you took me to your homes;
when I was naked, you clothed me; when I fell ill, you visited me; and
when I was in prison, you came to me." Then the righteous will answer
"Lord, when did we see you hungry, and feed you? Or thirsty, and give
you a drink? When did we see you a stranger, and take you to our homes?
Or naked, and clothe you? When did we see you ill, or in prison, and
come to you?" And the king will reply "I tell you, as often as you did
it to one of these my brothers or sisters, however unimportant they
seemed, you did it to me." Then he will say to those on his left "Go
from my presence, accursed, into the permanent fire which has been
prepared for the devil and his angels. For, when I was hungry, you gave
me no food; when I was thirsty, you gave me no drink; when I was a
stranger, you did not take me to your homes; when I was naked, you did
not clothe me; and, when I was ill and in prison, you did not visit me."
Then they, in their turn, will answer "Lord, when did we see you hungry,
or thirsty, or a stranger, or naked, or ill, or in prison, and did not
supply your wants?" And then he will reply "I tell you, as often as you
failed to do it to one of these, however unimportant, you failed to do
it to me." And these last will go away into lasting correction, but the
righteous into lasting life.'
     When Jesus had finished teaching all of that, he said to his
disciples, 'You know that in two days time the Festival of the Passover
will be here; and that the Son of Man is to be given up to be
crucified.' Then the chief priests and the elders of the people met in
the house of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas, and plotted
together to arrest Jesus by stealth and put him to death; but they said,
'Not during the Festival, or the people may riot.'
     After Jesus had reached Bethany, and while he was in the house of
Simon the leper, a woman came up to him with an alabaster jar of very
costly perfume, and poured the perfume on his head as he sat at the
table. The disciples were indignant at seeing this. 'What is this waste
for?' they exclaimed. 'It could have been sold for a large sum, and the
money given to poor people.'
     'Why are you troubling the woman?' Jesus said, when he noticed it.
'For this is a beautiful deed that she has done to me. You always have
the poor with you, but you will not always have me. In pouring this
perfume on my body, she prepares me for my burial. I tell you, wherever,
in the whole world, this good news is proclaimed, what this woman has
done will be told in memory of her.'
     It was then that one of the Twelve, named Judas Iscariot, made his
way to the chief priests, and said 'What are you willing to give me, if
I betray Jesus to you?' The Priests counted him out thirty pieces of
silver as payment. So from that time Judas looked for an opportunity to
betray Jesus.
     On the first day of the Festival of the unleavened bread, the
disciples came up to Jesus, and said, 'Where do you wish us to make
preparations for you to eat the Passover?'
     'Go into the city to a certain man,' he answered, 'and say to him
"The teacher says -- My time is near. I will keep the Passover with my
disciples at your house."' The disciples did as Jesus directed them, and
prepared the Passover. In the evening Jesus took his place with the
twelve disciples, and, while they were eating, he said, 'I tell you that
one of you will betray me.' In great grief they began to say to him, one
by one, 'Can it be I, Master?'
     'The one who dipped his bread beside me in the dish,' replied
Jesus, 'is the one who will betray me. True, the Son of Man must go, as
scripture says of him, yet alas for that man by whom the Son of Man is
being betrayed! For that man it would be better never to have been
born!' Judas, who was betraying him, turned to him and said, 'Can it be
I, Rabbi?'
     'It is,' answered Jesus.
     While they were eating, Jesus took some bread, and, after saying
the blessing, broke it and, as he gave it to his disciples, said, 'Take
it and eat it; this is my body.' Then he took a cup, and, after saying
the thanksgiving, gave it to them, with the words, 'Drink from it, all
of you; for this is my covenant blood, which is poured out for many for
the forgiveness of sins. I tell you that I will never, after this, drink
of this juice of the grape, until that day when I will drink it new with
you in the kingdom of my Father.'
     They then sang a hymn, and went out to the Mount of Olives. Then
Jesus said to them, 'Even you will all fall away from me tonight.
Scripture says -- "I will strike down the shepherd, and the sheep of the
flock will be scattered." But, after I have risen, I will go before you
into Galilee.' 'If everyone else falls away from you,' Peter answered,
'I will never fall away!'
     'I tell you,' replied Jesus, 'that this very night, before the cock
crows, you will disown me three times!' 'Even if I must die with you,'
Peter exclaimed, 'I will never disown you!' All the disciples spoke in
the same way.
     Then Jesus came with them to a garden called Gethsemane, and he
said to his disciples, 'Sit down here while I go and pray over there.'
Taking with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, he began to show
signs of sadness and deep distress of mind. 'I am sad at heart,' he
said, 'sad even to death; wait here and watch with me.' Going on a
little further, he threw himself on his face in prayer. 'My Father,' he
said, 'if it is possible, let me be spared this cup; only, not as I
will, but as you will.' Then he came to his disciples, and found them
asleep. 'What!' he said to Peter, 'could none of you watch with me for
one hour? Watch and pray so that you don't fall into temptation. True,
the spirit is eager, but human nature is weak.' Again, a second time, he
went away, and prayed. 'My Father,' he said, 'if I cannot be spared this
cup, but must drink it, your will be done!' And coming back again he
found them asleep, for their eyes were heavy. So he left them, and went
away again, and prayed a third time, again saying the same words. Then
he came to the disciples, and said, 'Sleep on now, and rest yourselves.
Look -- my time is close at hand, and the Son of Man is being betrayed
into the hands of wicked people. Up, and let us be going. Look! My
betrayer is close at hand.' And, while he was still speaking, Judas, who
was one of the Twelve, came in sight; and with him was a great crowd of
people, with swords and clubs, sent from the chief priests and elders of
the people. Now the betrayer had arranged a signal with them. 'The man
whom I kiss,' he had said, 'will be the one; arrest him.' So he went up
to Jesus at once, and exclaimed, 'Welcome, Rabbi!' and kissed him; at
which Jesus said to him, 'Friend, do what you have come for.' The men
went up, seized Jesus, and arrested him. Suddenly one of those who were
with Jesus stretched out his hand, and drew his sword, and striking the
high priest's servant, cut off his ear. 'Sheathe your sword,' Jesus
said, 'for all who draw the sword will be put to the sword. Do you think
that I cannot ask my Father for help, when he would at once send to my
aid more than twelve legions of angels? But in that case how would the
scriptures be fulfilled, which say that this must be?' Jesus at the same
time said to the crowds, 'Have you come out, as if after a robber, with
swords and clubs, to take me? I have sat teaching day after day in the
Temple Courts, and yet you did not arrest me.' The whole of this
occurred in fulfilment of the prophetic scriptures. Then the disciples
all forsook him and fled.
     Those who had arrested Jesus took him to Caiaphas, the high priest,
where the teachers of the Law and elders had assembled. Peter followed
him at a distance as far as the high priest's courtyard, to see the
outcome. Meanwhile the chief priests and the whole of the High Council
were trying to get such false evidence against Jesus, as would warrant
putting him to death, but they did not find any, although many came
forward with false evidence. Later on, however, two men came forward and
said, 'This man said "I am able to destroy the Temple of God, and to
build it in three days."' Then the high priest stood up, and said to
Jesus, 'Have you no answer? What is this evidence which these men are
giving against you?' But Jesus remained silent. The high priest said to
him, 'I order you, by the living God, to tell us whether you are the
Christ, the Son of God.'
     'It is true,' Jesus answered, 'Moreover I tell you all that
hereafter you will see the Son of Man sitting on the right hand of the
Almighty, and coming on the clouds of the heavens.' Then the high priest
tore his robes. 'This is blasphemy!' he exclaimed. 'Why do we want any
more witnesses? You have just heard his blasphemy! What is your
decision?' They answered, 'He deserves death.' Then they spat in his
face, and struck him, while others dealt blows at him, saying as they
did so, 'Now play the prophet for us, you Christ! Who was it that struck
you?' Peter, meanwhile, was sitting outside in the courtyard; and a
maidservant came up to him, and exclaimed, 'Why, you were with Jesus the
Galilean!' But Peter denied it before them all. 'I do not know what you
mean,' he replied. When he had gone out into the gateway, another maid
saw him, and said to those who were there, 'This man was with Jesus of
Nazareth!' Again he denied it with an oath, 'I do not know the man!' But
soon afterwards those who were standing by came up and said to Peter,
'You also are certainly one of them; why, even your way of speaking
proves it!' Then Peter said, 'I swear that I do not know the man! May
God punish me if I am lying!' At that moment a cock crowed; and Peter
remembered the words which Jesus had said -- "Before a cock has crowed,
you will disown me three times"; and he went outside, and wept bitterly.
     At daybreak all the chief priests and the elders of the people
consulted together against Jesus, to bring about his death. They put him
in chains and led him away, and gave him up to the Roman Governor,
Pilate. Then Judas, who betrayed him, seeing that Jesus was condemned,
repented of what he had done, and returned the thirty pieces of silver
to the chief priests and elders. 'I did wrong in betraying a good man to
his death,' he said. 'What has that to do with us?' they replied. 'You
must see to that yourself.' Judas flung down the pieces of silver in the
Temple, and left; and went away and hanged himself. The chief priests
took the pieces of silver, but they said, 'We must not put them into the
Temple treasury, because they are blood-money.' So, after consultation,
they used it to buy the "Potter's Field" as a burial ground for
foreigners, and that is why that field is called the "Field of Blood" to
this very day. Then it was that these words spoken by the prophet
Jeremiah were fulfilled -- "They took the thirty pieces of silver, the
price set on him by the people of Israel, and gave them for the potter's
field, as the Lord commanded me." Meanwhile Jesus was brought before the
Roman Governor. 'Are you the king of the Jews?' asked the Governor. 'It
is true,' answered Jesus. While charges were being brought against him
by the chief priests and elders, Jesus made no reply. Then Pilate said
to him, 'Don't you hear how many accusations they are making against
you?' Yet Jesus made no reply -- not even a single word; at which the
Governor was greatly astonished. Now, at the feast, the Governor was
accustomed to grant the people the release of any one prisoner whom they
might choose. At that time they had a notorious prisoner called
Barabbas. So, when the people had collected, Pilate said to them, 'Which
do you wish me to release for you? Barabbas? Or Jesus who is called
"Christ"?' For he knew that it was out of jealousy that they had given
Jesus up to him. While he was still on the Bench, his wife sent this
message to him -- 'Do not have anything to do with that good man, for I
have been very much troubled today in a dream because of him.' But the
chief priests and elders persuaded the crowds to ask for Barabbas, and
to kill Jesus. The Governor, however, said to them, 'Which of these two
do you wish me to release for you?'
     'Barabbas,' they answered. 'What then,' Pilate asked, 'should I do
with Jesus who is called "Christ?"' 'Crucify him,' they all replied.
'Why, what harm has he done?' he asked. But they kept shouting
furiously, 'Crucify him!' When Pilate saw that his efforts were
unavailing, but that, on the contrary, a riot was beginning, he took
some water, and washed his hands in the sight of the crowd, saying as he
did so, 'I am not answerable for this bloodshed; you must see to it
yourselves.' And all the people answered, 'His blood be on our heads and
on our children's!' Then Pilate released Barabbas to them, but Jesus he
had scourged, and gave him up to be crucified.
     After that, the Governor's soldiers took Jesus with them into the
Government house, and gathered the whole garrison round him. They
stripped him, and put on him a red military cloak, and having twisted
some thorns into a crown, put it on his head, and a rod in his right
hand, and then, going down on their knees before him, they mocked him.
'Long life to you, king of the Jews!' they said. They spat at him and,
taking the rod, kept striking him on the head; and, when they had left
off mocking him, they took off the military cloak, and put his own
clothes on him, and led him away to be crucified.
     As they were on their way out, they came upon a man from Cyrene
called Simon, and they compelled him to go with them to carry the cross.
On reaching a place named Golgotha (a place named from its likeness to a
skull), they gave him some wine to drink which had been mixed with gall;
but after tasting it, Jesus refused to drink it. When they had crucified
him, they divided his clothes among them by casting lots. Then they sat
down, and kept watch over him there. Above his head they fixed the
accusation against him written out -- "THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE
JEWS." At the same time two robbers were crucified with him, one on the
right, the other on the left. The passers-by railed at him, shaking
their heads as they said, 'You who would "destroy the Temple and build
one in three days," save yourself! If you are God's Son, come down from
the cross!' In the same way the chief priests, with the Teachers of the
Law and elders, said in mockery, 'He saved others, but he cannot save
himself! He is the "king of Israel"! Why doesn't he come down from the
cross now, then we will believe in him. He has trusted in God; if God
wants him, let him deliver him now; for he said "I am God's Son."' Even
the robbers, who were crucified with him, insulted him in the same way.
After midday a darkness came over all the country, lasting until three
in the afternoon. About three Jesus called out loudly, 'Eloi, Eloi, lema
sabacthani' -- that is to say, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken
me?" Some of those standing by heard this, and said, 'The man is calling
for Elijah!' One of them immediately ran and took a sponge, and, filling
it with common wine, put it on the end of a rod, and offered it to him
to drink. But the rest said, 'Wait and let us see if Elijah is coming to
save him.'{  (27:49)   Some later manuscripts add: However another man
took a spear, and pierced his side; and water and blood flowed from it.
} But Jesus, uttering another loud cry, gave up his spirit. Suddenly the
Temple curtain was torn in two from top to bottom, the earth shook, the
rocks were torn asunder, the tombs opened, and the bodies of many of
God's people who had fallen asleep rose, and they, leaving their tombs,
went, after the resurrection of Jesus, into the Holy City, and appeared
to many people. The Roman centurion, and the men with him who were
watching Jesus, on seeing the earthquake and all that was happening,
became greatly frightened and exclaimed, 'This must indeed have been
God's Son!' There were many women there, watching from a distance, who
had accompanied Jesus from Galilee and had been attending on him. Among
them were Mary of Magdala, Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the
mother of Zebedee's sons.
     When evening had fallen, there came a rich man from  Arimathea,
named Joseph, who had himself become a disciple of Jesus. He went to see
Pilate, and asked for the body of Jesus. Pilate ordered it to be given
him. So Joseph took the body, and wrapped it in a clean linen sheet, and
laid it in his newly made tomb which he had cut in the rock; and, before
he left, he rolled a great stone against the entrance of the tomb. Mary
of Magdala and the other Mary remained behind, sitting in front of the
grave.
     The next day -- that is, the day following the Preparation-day --
the chief priests and Pharisees came in a body to Pilate, and said,
'Sir, we remember that, during his lifetime, that impostor said "I will
rise after three days." So order the tomb to be made secure until the
third day. Otherwise his disciples may come and steal him, and then say
to the people "He has risen from the dead," when the latest imposture
will be worse than the first.'
     'You may have a guard,' was Pilate's reply. 'Go and make the tomb
as secure as you can.' So they went and made the tomb secure, by sealing
the stone, in presence of the guard.

*The Risen Life*

     After the Sabbath, as the first day of the week began to dawn, Mary
of Magdala and the other Mary had gone to look at the grave, when
suddenly a great earthquake occurred. For an angel of the Lord descended
from heaven, and came and rolled away the stone, and seated himself on
it. His appearance was as dazzling as lightning, and his clothing was as
white as snow; and, in their terror of him, the men on guard trembled
violently and became like dead men. But the angel, addressing the women,
said, 'You need not be afraid. I know that it is Jesus, who was
crucified, for whom you are looking. He is not here; for he has risen,
as he said he would. Come, and see the place where he was lying; and
then go quickly and say to his disciples "He has risen from the dead,
and is going before you into Galilee; there you will see him." Remember,
I have told you.' They left the tomb quickly, in awe and great joy, and
ran to tell the news to the disciples. Suddenly Jesus met them.
'Welcome!' he said. The women went up to him, and clasped his feet,
bowing to the ground before him. Then Jesus said to them, 'Do not be
afraid; go and tell my brothers and sisters to set out for Galilee, and
they will see me there.' While they were still on their way, some of the
guard came into the city, and reported to the chief priests everything
that had happened. So they and the elders met and, after holding a
consultation, gave a large sum of money to the soldiers, and told them
to say that his disciples came in the night, and stole him while they
were asleep; 'And should this matter come before the Governor,' they
added, 'we will satisfy him, and see that you have nothing to fear.' So
the soldiers took the money, and did as they were instructed. This story
spread widely; the people of Judea still tell it today.
     The eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus
told them to meet him; and, when they saw him, they bowed to the ground
before him; although some felt doubtful. Then Jesus came up, and spoke
to them, saying, 'All authority in heaven and on the earth has been
given to me. Therefore go and make disciples of all the nations,
baptising them in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit,
and teaching them to lay to heart all the commands that I have given
you; and, remember, I myself am with you every day until the close of
the age.'

                                  THE
                         GOOD NEWS ACCORDING TO
                                  MARK


*The Preparation*

     The beginning of the good news about Jesus Christ.
     It is said in the prophet Isaiah --

     "I am sending my messenger ahead of you;
         he will prepare your way.
     The voice of one crying aloud in the wilderness:
         'Prepare the road for the Lord,
             make a straight path for him.'"
 John the Baptiser appeared in the wilderness, proclaiming a baptism on
repentance, for the forgiveness of sins. The whole of Judea, as well as
all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, went out to him; and they were
baptised by him in the Jordan River, confessing their sins.
     John wore clothes made of camels' hair, with a leather strap round
his waist, and lived on locusts and wild honey; and he proclaimed --
'After me is coming someone more powerful than I am, and I am not fit
even to stoop down and unfasten his sandals. I have baptised you with
water, but he will baptise you with the Holy Spirit.'
     Now about that time Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee, and was
baptised by John in the Jordan. Just as he was coming up out of the
water, he saw the heavens split open and the Spirit coming down to him
like a dove, and from the heavens came a voice -- 'You are my dearly
loved son; you bring me great joy.'
     Immediately afterwards the Spirit drove Jesus out into the
wilderness; and he was there in the wilderness forty days, tempted by
Satan, and among the wild beasts, while the angels helped him.

*The Work in Galilee*

     After John had been arrested, Jesus went to Galilee, proclaiming
the good news of God -- 'The time has come, and the kingdom of God is at
hand; repent, and believe the good news.'
     As Jesus was going along the shore of the Sea of Galilee, he saw
Simon and his brother Andrew casting a net in the sea, for they were
fishermen. 'Come and follow me,' Jesus said, 'and I will teach you to
fish for people.' They left their nets at once, and followed him.
     Going on a little further, he saw James, Zebedee's son, and his
brother John, who were in their boat mending the nets. Jesus called them
at once, and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the crew,
and went after him.
     They walked to Capernaum. On the next Sabbath Jesus went into the
synagogue and began to teach. The people were amazed at his teaching,
for he taught them like one who had authority, and not like the teachers
of the Law. Now there was in their synagogue at the time a man under the
power of a foul spirit, who called out, 'What do you want with us, Jesus
the Nazarene? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are -- the
Holy One of God!' But Jesus rebuked the spirit, 'Be silent! Come out
from him.' The foul spirit threw the man into a fit, and with a loud cry
came out from him. They were all so amazed that they kept asking each
other, 'What is this? What is this, a new kind of teaching? He gives his
commands with authority even to the foul spirits, and they obey him!'
His fame spread at once in all directions, through the whole region of
Galilee.
     As soon as they had left the synagogue, they went to the house of
Simon and Andrew, along with James and John. Now Simon's mother-in-law
was lying ill with a fever, and they at once told Jesus about her. Jesus
went up to her and, grasping her hand, raised her up; the fever left
her, and she began to take care of them.
     In the evening, after sunset, the people brought to Jesus all who
were ill or possessed by demons; and the whole city was gathered round
the door. Jesus cured many who were ill with various diseases, and drove
out many demons, and would not permit them to speak, because they knew
him to be the Christ.
     In the morning, long before daylight, Jesus got up and went out to
a lonely spot, where he began to pray. But Simon and his companions went
out searching for him; and, when they found him, they exclaimed,
'Everyone is looking for you!' But Jesus said to them, 'Let us go
somewhere else, into the country towns nearby so that I can make my
proclamation in them also; for that was why I came.' And he went about
making his proclamation in their synagogues all through Galilee, and
driving out the demons.
     One day a leper came to Jesus and, falling on his knees, begged him
for help. 'If only you are willing,' he said, 'you are able to make me
clean.' Moved with compassion, Jesus stretched out his hand and touched
him, saying as he did so, 'I am willing; become clean.' Instantly the
leprosy left the man, and he became clean; and then Jesus, after sternly
warning him, immediately sent him away, and said to him, 'Be careful not
to say anything to anyone; but go and show yourself to the priest, and
make the offerings for your cleansing directed by Moses, as evidence of
your cure.' The man, however, went away, and began to speak about it
publicly, and to spread the story so widely, that Jesus could no longer
go openly into a town, but stayed outside in lonely places; and people
came to him from every direction.
     Some days later, when Jesus came back to Capernaum, the news spread
that he was in a house there; and so many people collected together,
that after a while there was no room for them even round the door; and
he began to tell them his message. Some people came, bringing to him a
paralysed man, who was being carried by four of them. They were unable
to get him near to Jesus, because of the crowd, so they removed the roof
above Jesus, and, when they had made an opening, they let down the mat
on which the paralysed man was lying. When Jesus saw their faith, he
said to the man, 'Child, your sins are forgiven.'
     But some of the teachers of the Law who were sitting there were
debating in their minds, 'Why does this man speak like this? He is
blaspheming! Who can forgive sins except God?' Jesus, at once
intuitively aware that they were debating with themselves in this way,
said to them, 'Why are you debating in your minds about this? Which is
easier? -- to say to the paralysed man, "Your sins are forgiven"? Or to
say "Get up, and take up your mat, and walk"? But so you may know that
the Son of Man has power to forgive sins on earth' -- here he said to
the paralysed man -- 'To you I say, Get up, take up your mat, and return
to your home.' The man got up, and immediately took up his mat, and went
out before them all; at which they were amazed, and, as they praised
God, they said, 'We have never seen anything like this!'
     Jesus went out again to the sea; and all the people came to him,
and he taught them. As he went along, he saw Levi, the son of Alphaeus,
sitting in the tax office, and said to him, 'Follow me.' Levi got up and
followed him.
     Later on he was in his house having dinner, and a number of tax
collectors and outcasts took their places at the table with Jesus and
his disciples; for many of them were following him. When the teachers of
the Law belonging to the party of the Pharisees saw that he was eating
in the company of such people, they said to his disciples, 'Why does he
eat with the tax collectors and outcasts?' Hearing this, Jesus said, 'It
is not those who are healthy who need a doctor, but those who are ill. I
did not come to call the religious, but the outcast.'
     Now John's disciples and the Pharisees were fasting, and people
came and asked Jesus, 'Why is it that John's disciples and the disciples
of the Pharisees fast, while yours do not?' Jesus answered, 'Can the
groom's friends fast, while the groom is with them? As long as they have
the groom with them, they cannot fast. But the days will come, when the
groom will be taken away from them, and they will fast then -- when that
day comes.'
     'No one ever sews a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment; if
they do, the patch tears away from it -- the new from the old -- and a
worse tear is made. And no one ever puts new wine into old wine-skins;
if they do, the wine will burst the skins, and both the wine and the
skins are lost. But new wine is put into fresh skins.'
     One Sabbath, as Jesus was walking through the cornfields, his
disciples began to pick the ears of wheat as they went along. 'Look!'
the Pharisees said to him, 'why are they doing what is not allowed on
the Sabbath?'
     'Have you never read,' answered Jesus, 'what David did when he was
in need and hungry, he and his companions -- how he went into the house
of God, in the time of Abiathar the high priest, and ate the consecrated
bread, which only the priests are allowed to eat, and gave some to his
comrades as well?'
     Then Jesus added, 'The Sabbath was made for people, and not people
for the Sabbath; so the Son of Man is lord even of the Sabbath.'
     On another occasion Jesus went in to a synagogue, where there was a
man whose hand was withered. And they watched Jesus closely, to see if
he would cure the man on the Sabbath, so that they might have a charge
to bring against him. 'Stand out in the middle,' Jesus said to the man
with the withered hand; and to the people he said, 'Is it allowable to
do good at the Sabbath -- or harm? To save a life, or destroy it?' As
they remained silent, Jesus looked round at them in anger, grieving at
the hardness of their hearts, and said to the man, 'Stretch out your
hand.' The man stretched it out; and his hand had become sound.
Immediately on leaving the synagogue, the Pharisees and the Herodians
united in laying a plot against Jesus, to put him to death.

     Then Jesus went away with his disciples to the sea, followed by a
great number of people from Galilee. A great number, hearing of all that
he was doing, came to him from Judea, from Jerusalem, from Edom, from
beyond the Jordan, and from the country round Tyre and Sidon. So Jesus
told his disciples to keep a small boat close by, so that the crowd
would not crush him. For he had cured many of them, and so people kept
crowding around him, so all who were sick might touch him. The foul
spirits, too, whenever they caught sight of him, flung themselves down
before him, and screamed out, 'You are the Son of God'! But he
repeatedly warned them not to make him known.
     Jesus made his way up the hill, and called those whom he wished;
and they went to him. He appointed twelve -- whom he also named
"apostles" -- so that they might be with him, and that he might send
them out as his messengers, to preach, and with power to drive out
demons. So he appointed the Twelve -- Peter (which was the name that
Jesus gave to Simon), James, the son of Zebedee, and his brother John
(to whom he gave the name of Boanerges, which means the Thunderers),
Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus,
Thaddaeus, Simon the Zealot, and Judas Iscariot, the man who betrayed
him.
     Jesus went into a house; and again a crowd collected, so that they
were not even able to eat their food. When his relatives heard of it,
they went to take charge of him, for they said that he was out of his
mind.
     The teachers of the Law, who had come down from Jerusalem, said,
'He has Beelzebul in him! He drives the demons out by the help of their
chief.' So Jesus called them to him, and answered them in parables, 'How
can Satan drive out Satan? When a kingdom is divided against itself, it
cannot last; and when a household is divided against itself, it will not
be able to last. So, if Satan is in revolt against himself and is
divided, he cannot last -- his end has come!
     'No man who has broken into a strong man's house can carry off his
goods, without first tying him up; and not until then will he plunder
his house. I tell you that people will be forgiven everything -- their
sins, and all the slanders that they utter; but whoever slanders the
Holy Spirit remains unforgiven to the end; he has to answer for an
enduring sin.' This was said in reply to the charge that he had a foul
spirit in him. His mother and his brothers came, and stood outside, and
sent to ask him to come to them. There was a crowd sitting round Jesus,
and some of them said to him, 'Look, your mother and your brothers are
outside, asking for you.'
     'Who is my mother? And my brothers?' was his reply. Then he looked
around on the people sitting in a circle round him, and said, 'Here are
my mother and my brothers! Whoever does the will of God is my brother
and sister and mother.'

     Jesus again began to teach by the sea; and, as an immense crowd was
gathering round him, he got into a boat, and sat in it on the sea, while
all the people were on the shore at the water's edge.
     Then he taught them many truths in parables; and in the course of
his teaching he said to them:
     'Listen! The sower went out to sow; and presently, as he was
sowing, some of the seed fell along the path; and the birds came, and
ate it up. Some fell on rocky ground, where it had not much soil, and,
because the soil wasn't deep, sprang up at once; but, when the sun rose,
it was scorched, and, because their roots were not deep enough, withered
away. Some of the seed fell among brambles; but the brambles shot up and
completely choked it, and it yielded no return. Some fell into good
soil, and, shooting up and growing, yielded a return, amounting to
thirty, sixty, and even a hundred fold.' And Jesus said, 'Let anyone who
has ears to hear with hear.'
     Afterwards, when he was alone, his followers and the Twelve asked
him about his parables; and he said, 'To you the hidden truth of the
kingdom of God has been imparted; but to those who are outside it all
teaching takes the form of parables so that -- "Though they have eyes,
they may see without perceiving; and though they have ears, they may
hear without understanding; otherwise some day they might turn and be
forgiven."'
     'You do not know the meaning of this parable?' he went on, 'Then
how will you understand all the other parables? The sower sows the
message. The people meant by the seed that falls along the path are
these -- where the message is sown, but, as soon as they have heard it,
Satan immediately comes and carries away the message that has been sown
in them. So, too, those meant by the seed sown on the rocky places are
the people who, when they have heard the message, at once accept it
joyfully; but, as they have no root, they stand only for a short time;
and so, when trouble or persecution arises because of the message, they
fall away at once. Those meant by the seed sown among the brambles are
different; they are the people who hear the message, but the cares of
life, and the glamour of wealth, and cravings for many other things come
in and completely choke the message, so that it gives no return. But the
people meant by the seed sown on the good ground are those who hear the
message, and welcome it, and yield a return, thirty, sixty, and even a
hundred fold.'
     Jesus said to them, 'Is a lamp brought to be put under a basket or
under the couch, instead of being put on the lamp-stand? There is
nothing hidden that will not come to light and nothing is concealed that
will not be brought into the open. Let all who have ears to hear with
hear.
     'Take care what you listen to,' said Jesus. 'The standard you use
will be used for you, and more will be added for you. For, to those who
have, more will be given; while, from those who have nothing, even what
they have will be taken away.'
     Jesus also said, 'This is what the kingdom of God is like -- like a
man who has scattered seed on the ground, and then sleeps by night and
rises by day, while the seed is shooting up and growing -- he knows not
how. The ground bears the crop of itself -- first the blade, then the
ear, and then the full grain in the ear; but, as soon as the crop is
ready, immediately he puts in the sickle because harvest has come.'
     Jesus also said, 'To what can we liken the kingdom of God? By what
can we illustrate it? Perhaps by the growth of a mustard seed. This
seed, when sown in the ground, though it is smaller than all other
seeds, yet, when sown, shoots up, and becomes larger than any other
herb, and puts out great branches, so that even the wild birds can roost
in its shelter.'
     With many such parables Jesus used to speak to the people of his
message, as far as they were able to receive it; and to them he never
used to speak except in parables; but in private to his own disciples he
explained everything.

     In the evening of the same day, Jesus said to them, 'Let us go
across.' So, leaving the crowd behind, they took him with them, just as
he was, in the boat; and there were other boats with him. A violent
squall came on, and the waves kept dashing into the boat, so that the
boat was actually filling. Jesus was in the stern asleep on the cushion;
and the disciples roused him and cried, 'Teacher! Is it nothing to you
that we are lost?' Jesus rose and rebuked the wind, and said to the sea,
'Hush! Be still!' Then the wind dropped, and a great calm followed. 'Why
are you so timid?' he exclaimed. 'Have you no faith yet?' But they were
struck with great awe, and said to one another, 'Who can this be that
even the wind and the sea obey him?'
     They came to the other side of the sea -- the region of the
Gerasenes; and, as soon as Jesus had got out of the boat, he met a man
coming out of the tombs, who was under the power of a foul spirit, and
who made his home in the tombs. No one had ever been able to secure him,
even with a chain; for, though he had many times been left secured with
fetters and chains, he had snapped the chains and broken the fetters to
pieces, and no one could master him. Night and day alike, he was
continually shrieking in the tombs and among the hills, and cutting
himself with stones. Catching sight of Jesus from a distance, he ran and
bowed to the ground before him, shrieking out in a loud voice, 'What do
you want with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? For God's sake do not
torment me!' For Jesus had said, 'Come out from the man, you foul
spirit.' And he asked him, 'What is your name?' 'My name,' he said, 'is
Legion, for there are many of us;' and he begged Jesus again and again
not to send them away out of that country.
     There was a large herd of pigs close by, feeding on the hillside;
and the spirits begged Jesus, 'Send us into the pigs so that we can take
possession of them.' Jesus gave them leave. They came out, and entered
into the pigs; and the herd -- about two thousand in number -- rushed
down the steep slope into the sea and were drowned in the sea.
     Then the men who tended them ran away, and carried the news to the
town, and to the country round; and the people went to see what had
happened. When they came to Jesus, they found the possessed man sitting
there, clothed and in his right mind -- the man who had had the "Legion"
in him -- and they were awe-struck. Then those who had seen it related
to them all that had happened to the possessed man, as well as about the
pigs; so they began to beg Jesus to leave their region.
     As Jesus was getting into the boat, the possessed man begged him to
let him stay with him. But Jesus refused. 'Go back to your home, to your
own people,' he said, 'and tell them of all that the Lord has done for
you, and how he took pity on you.' So the man went, and began to
proclaim in the district of the Ten Towns all that Jesus had done for
him; and everyone was amazed.
     By the time Jesus had recrossed in the boat to the opposite shore,
a great number of people had gathered to meet him, and were standing by
the sea. One of the leaders of the synagogue, whose name was Jairus,
came and, as soon as he saw Jesus, threw himself at his feet and begged
him repeatedly, saying, 'My little daughter is at death's door. Please
come and place your hands on her so that she may recover and live.' So
Jesus went with him. A great number of people followed Jesus, and kept
pressing round him.
     Meanwhile a woman who for twelve years had suffered from
haemorrhage, and undergone much at the hands of many doctors, (spending
all she had without obtaining any relief, but, on the contrary, growing
worse), heard about Jesus, came behind in the crowd, and touched his
cloak. 'If I can only touch his clothes,' she said, 'I will get well!'
At once her bleeding stopped, and she felt in herself that she was cured
of her affliction. Jesus at once became aware of the power that had gone
out from him, and, turning round in the crowd, he said, 'Who touched my
clothes?'
     'You see the people pressing round you,' exclaimed his disciples,
'and yet you say "Who touched me?"' But Jesus looked about to see who
had done it. Then the woman, in fear and trembling, knowing what had
happened to her, came and threw herself down before him, and told him
the whole truth. 'Daughter,' he said, 'your faith has delivered you. Go,
and peace be with you; be free from your affliction.'
     Before he had finished speaking, some people from the house of the
synagogue leader came and said, 'Your daughter is dead! Why should you
trouble the teacher further?' But Jesus, overhearing what they were
saying, said to the synagogue leader, 'Do not be afraid; only have
faith.' And he allowed no one to accompany him, except Peter, James, and
John, the brother of James. Presently they reached the leader's house,
where Jesus saw a scene of confusion -- people weeping and wailing
incessantly. 'Why this confusion and weeping?' he said on entering. 'The
little child is not dead; she is asleep.' They began to laugh at him;
but he sent them all out, and then, with the child's father and mother
and his companions, went into the room where she was lying. Taking her
hand, Jesus said to her, 'Talitha, koum!' -- which means "little girl, I
am speaking to you -- Rise!" The little girl stood up at once, and began
to walk about; for she was twelve years old. And, as soon as they saw
it, they were overwhelmed with amazement; but Jesus repeatedly cautioned
them not to let anyone know of it, and told them to give her something
to eat.
     On leaving that place, Jesus, followed by his disciples, went to
his own part of the country. When the Sabbath came, he began to teach in
the synagogue; and the people, as they listened, were deeply impressed.
'Where did he get this?' they said, 'and what is this wisdom that has
been given him? And these miracles which he is doing? Isn't he the
carpenter, the son of Mary, and the brother of James, and Joses, and
Judas, and Simon? And aren't his sisters, too, living here among us?'
This proved a hindrance to their believing in him; at which Jesus said,
'A prophet is not without honour, except in his home town, and among his
own relatives, and in his own home.' And he could not work any miracle
there, beyond placing his hands on a few infirm persons, and curing
them; and he wondered at the want of faith shown by the people. Jesus
went round the villages, one after another, teaching.

     He called the Twelve to him, and began to send them out as his
messengers, two and two, and gave them authority over foul spirits. He
instructed them to take nothing but a staff for the journey -- not even
bread, or a bag, or coins in their purse; but they were to wear sandals,
and not to put on a second coat. 'Whenever you go to stay at a house,'
he said, 'remain there until you leave that place; and if a place does
not welcome you, or listen to you, as you go out of it shake off the
dust that is on the soles of your feet, as a protest against them.' So
they set out, and proclaimed the need of repentance. They drove out many
demons, and anointed with oil many who were infirm, and cured them.
     Now King Herod heard of Jesus; for his name had become well known.
People were saying -- 'John the Baptiser must have risen from the dead,
and that is why these miraculous powers are active in him.' Others again
said -- 'He is Elijah,' and others -- 'He is a prophet, like one of the
great prophets.' But when Herod heard of him, he said -- 'The man whom I
beheaded -- John -- he must be risen!'
     For Herod himself had sent and arrested John, and put him in
prison, in chains, to please Herodias, the wife of his brother Philip,
because Herod had married her. For John had said to Herod -- 'You have
no right to be living with your brother's wife.' So Herodias was
incensed against John, and wanted to put him to death, but was unable to
do so, because Herod stood in fear of John, knowing him to be an upright
and holy man, and protected him. He had listened to John, but still
remained much perplexed, and yet he found pleasure in listening to him.
     A suitable opportunity, however, occurred when Herod, on his
birthday, gave a dinner to his high officials, and his generals, and the
foremost men in Galilee. When his daughter -- that is, the daughter of
Herodias -- came in and danced, she delighted Herod and those who were
dining with him. 'Ask me for whatever you like,' the king said to the
girl, 'and I will give it to you'; and he swore to her that he would
give her whatever she asked him -- up to half his kingdom. The girl went
out, and said to her mother 'What must I ask for?'
     'The head of John the Baptiser,' answered her mother. So she went
in as quickly as possible to the king, and made her request. 'I want
you,' she said, 'to give me at once, on a dish, the head of John the
Baptist.' The king was much distressed; yet, because of his oath and of
the guests at his table, he did not like to refuse her. He immediately
dispatched one of his bodyguard, with orders to bring John's head. The
man went and beheaded John in the prison, and, bringing his head on a
dish, gave it to the girl, and the girl gave it to her mother.
     When John's disciples heard of it, they came and took his body
away, and laid it in a tomb.
     When the apostles came back to Jesus, they told him all that they
had done and all that they had taught. 'Come by yourselves privately to
some lonely spot,' he said, 'and rest for a while' -- for there were so
many people coming and going that they had not time even to eat. So they
set off privately in their boat for a lonely spot. Many people saw them
going, and recognised them, and from all the towns they flocked together
to the place on foot, and got there before them. On getting out of the
boat, Jesus saw a great crowd, and his heart was moved at the sight of
them, because they were like sheep without a shepherd; and he began to
teach them many things. When it grew late, his disciples came up to him,
and said, 'This is a lonely spot, and it is already late. Send the
people away, so that they may go to the farms and villages around and
buy themselves something to eat.' But Jesus answered, 'It is for you to
give them something to eat.' 'Are we to go and spend almost a year's
wages on bread,' they asked, 'to give them to eat?'
     'How many loaves have you?' he asked, 'Go, and see.' When they had
found out, they told him, 'Five, and two fish.' Jesus directed them to
make all the people take their seats on the green grass, in parties; and
they sat down in groups -- in hundreds, and in fifties. Taking the five
loaves and the two fish, Jesus looked up to heaven, and said the
blessing; he broke the loaves into pieces, and gave them to his
disciples for them to serve out to the people, and he divided the two
fish also among them all. Everyone had sufficient to eat; and they
picked up enough broken pieces to fill twelve baskets, as well as some
of the fish. The people who ate the bread were five thousand in number.
     Immediately afterwards Jesus made his disciples get into the boat,
and cross over in advance, in the direction of Bethsaida, while he
himself was dismissing the crowd. After he had taken leave of the
people, he went away up the hill to pray. When evening fell, the boat
was out in the middle of the sea, and Jesus on the shore alone. Seeing
them labouring at the oars -- for the wind was against them -- about
three hours after midnight Jesus came towards them, walking on the
water, intending to join them. But, when they saw him walking on the
water, they thought it was a ghost, and cried out; for all of them saw
him, and were terrified. But Jesus at once spoke to them. 'Courage!' he
said, 'it is I; do not be afraid!' Then he got into the boat with them,
and the wind dropped. The disciples were utterly amazed, for they had
not understood about the loaves, their minds being slow to learn. When
they had crossed over, they landed at Gennesaret, and moored the boat.
But they had no sooner left her than the people, recognising Jesus,
hurried over the whole countryside, and began to carry about on mats
those who were ill, wherever they heard he was. So wherever he went --
to villages, or towns, or farms -- they would lay their sick in the
market-places, begging him to let them touch only the tassel of his
cloak; and all who touched were made well.

     One day the Pharisees and some of the teachers of the Law who had
come from Jerusalem gathered round Jesus. They had noticed that some of
his disciples ate their food with their hands "defiled," by which they
meant unwashed. (For the Pharisees, and indeed all strict Jews, will not
eat without first scrupulously washing their hands, holding in this to
the traditions of their ancestors. When they come from market, they will
not eat without first sprinkling themselves; and there are many other
customs which they have inherited and hold to, such as the ceremonial
washing of cups, and jugs, and copper pans). So the Pharisees and the
teachers of the Law asked Jesus this question -- 'How is it that your
disciples do not follow the traditions of our ancestors, but eat their
food with defiled hands?' His answer was, 'It was well said by Isaiah
when he prophesied about you hypocrites in the words -- "This is a
people who honour me with their lips, while their hearts are far removed
from me; but vainly do they worship me, For they teach but human
precepts." You neglect God's commandments and hold to human traditions.
Wisely do you set aside God's commandments,' he exclaimed, 'to keep your
own traditions! For while Moses said "Honour your father and your
mother," and "Let anyone who abuses their father or mother suffer
death," you say "If a person says to their father or mother 'Whatever of
mine might have been of service to you is Corban'" (which means "Set
apart for God") -- why, then you do not allow them to do anything
further for their father or mother! In this way you nullify the words of
God by your traditions, which you hand down; and you do many similar
things.'
     Then Jesus called the people to him again, and said, 'Listen to me,
all of you, and mark my words. There is nothing external to a person,
which by going into them can defile them; but the things that come out
of a person are the things that defile them.' {  (7:16)  Some later
manuscripts add: Let anyone with ears to hear, listen. }
     When Jesus went indoors, away from the crowd, his disciples began
questioning him about this saying. 'What, do even you understand so
little?' exclaimed Jesus. 'Don't you see that there is nothing external
to a person, which by going into a person, can defile them, because it
does not pass into his heart, but into his stomach, and is afterwards
got rid of?' -- in saying this Jesus pronounced all food clean. 'It is
what comes out from a person,' he added, 'that defiles them, for it is
from within, out of the hearts of people, that there come evil thoughts
-- sexual immorality, theft, murder, adultery, greed, wickedness,
deceit, indecency, envy, slander, haughtiness, folly; all these wicked
things come from within, and do defile a person.'
     On leaving that place, Jesus went to the district of Tyre and
Sidon. He went into a house, and did not wish anyone to know it, but
could not escape notice. For a woman, whose little daughter had a foul
spirit in her, heard of him immediately, and came and threw herself at
his feet -- the woman was a foreigner, from Syrian Phoenicia -- and she
begged him to drive the demon out of her daughter. 'Let the children be
satisfied first,' answered Jesus. 'For it is not fair to take the
children's food, and throw it to dogs.'
     'Yes, Master,' she replied. 'Even the dogs under the table do feed
on the children's crumbs.'
     'For saying that,' he answered, 'you may go. The demon has gone out
of your daughter.' The woman went home, and found the child lying on her
bed, and the demon gone.
     On returning from the district of Tyre, Jesus went, by way of
Sidon, to the Sea of Galilee, across the district of the Ten Towns. Some
people brought to him a man who was deaf and almost dumb, and they
begged Jesus to place his hand on him. Jesus took him aside from the
crowd quietly, put his fingers into the man's ears, and touched his
tongue with saliva. Then, looking up to heaven, he sighed, and said to
the man, 'Ephphatha!' which means "Be opened." The man's ears were
opened, the string of his tongue was freed, and he began to talk
plainly. Jesus insisted on their not telling anyone; but the more he
insisted, the more perseveringly they made it known, and a profound
impression was made on the people. 'He has done everything well!' they
exclaimed. 'He makes even the deaf hear and the dumb speak!'

     About that time, when there was again a great crowd of people who
had nothing to eat, Jesus called his disciples to him, and said, 'My
heart is moved at the sight of all these people, for they have already
been with me three days and they have nothing to eat; and if I send them
away to their homes hungry, they will break down on the way; and some of
them have come a long distance.'
     'Where will it be possible,' his disciples answered, 'to get
sufficient bread for these people in this lonely place?'
     'How many loaves have you?' he asked. 'Seven,' they answered. Jesus
told the crowd to sit down on the ground. Then he took the seven loaves,
and, after saying the thanksgiving, broke them, and gave them to his
disciples to serve out; and they served them out to the crowd. They had
also a few small fish; and, after he had said the blessing, he told the
disciples to serve out these as well. The people had sufficient to eat,
and they picked up seven baskets full of the broken pieces that were
left. There were about four thousand people. Then Jesus dismissed them.
Immediately afterwards, getting into the boat with his disciples, Jesus
went to the district of Dalmanutha.
     Here the Pharisees came out, and began to argue with Jesus, asking
him for some sign from the heavens, to test him. Sighing deeply, Jesus
said, 'Why does this generation ask for a sign? I tell you, no sign will
be given it.' So he left them to themselves, and, getting into the boat
again, went away to the opposite shore.
     Now the disciples had forgotten to take any bread with them, one
loaf being all that they had in the boat. So Jesus gave them this
warning. 'Take care,' he said, 'beware of the leaven of the Pharisees
and the leaven of Herod.' They began talking to one another about their
being short of bread; and, noticing this, Jesus said to them, 'Why are
you talking about your being short of bread? Don't you yet see or
understand? Are your minds still so slow or comprehension? Though you
have eyes, do you not see? And though you have ears, do you not hear?
Don't you remember, when I broke up the five loaves for the five
thousand, how many baskets of broken pieces you picked up?'
     'Twelve,' they said. 'And when the seven for the four thousand, how
many basketfuls of broken pieces did you pick up?'
     'Seven,' they said. 'Don't you understand now?' he repeated.
     They came to Bethsaida. There some people brought a blind man to
Jesus, and begged him to touch him. Taking the blind man's hand, Jesus
led him to the outskirts of the village, and, when he had put saliva on
the man's eyes, he placed his hands on him, and asked him, 'Do you see
anything?' The man looked up, and said, 'I see the people, for, as they
walk about, they look to me like trees.' Then Jesus again placed his
hands on the man's eyes; and the man saw clearly, his sight was
restored, and he saw everything with perfect distinctness. Jesus sent
him to his home, and said, 'Do not go even into the village.'

     Afterwards Jesus and his disciples went into the villages round
Caesarea Philippi; and on the way he asked his disciples this question
-- 'Who do people say that I am?'
     'John the Baptist,' they answered, 'but others say Elijah, while
others say one of the prophets.'
     'But you,' he asked, 'who do you say that I am?' To this Peter
replied, 'You are the Christ.' At which Jesus charged them not to say
this about him to anyone. Then he began to teach them that the Son of
Man must undergo much suffering, and that he must be rejected by the
elders, and the chief priests, and the teachers of the Law, and be put
to death, and rise again after three days. He said all this quite
openly. But Peter took Jesus aside, and began to rebuke him. Jesus,
however, turning round and seeing his disciples, rebuked Peter. 'Out of
my sight, Satan!' he exclaimed. 'For you look at things, not as God
does, but as people do.'
     Calling the people and his disciples to him, Jesus said, 'If anyone
wishes to walk in my steps, they must renounce self, take up their
cross, and follow me. For whoever wishes to save their life will lose
it, and whoever, for my sake and for the sake of the good news, will
lose their life will save it. What good is it to a person to gain the
whole world and forfeit their life? For what could a person give that is
of equal value with their life? Whoever is ashamed of me and of my
teaching, in this unfaithful and wicked generation, of them will the Son
of Man be ashamed, when he comes in his Father's glory with the holy
angels.'
     'I tell you,' he added, 'that some of those who are standing here
will not know death until they have seen the kingdom of God come in
power.'
     Six days later, Jesus took with him Peter, James, and John, and led
them up a high mountain alone by themselves. There his appearance was
transformed before their eyes, and his clothes became whiter than any
launderer in the whole world could bleach them. And Elijah appeared to
them, in company with Moses; and they were talking with Jesus. 'Rabbi,'
said Peter, interposing, 'it is good to be here; let us make three
tents, one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.' For he did not
know what to say, because they were much afraid. Then a cloud came down
and enveloped them; and from the cloud there came a voice -- 'This is my
dearly loved son; listen to him.' And suddenly, on looking round, they
saw that there was now no one with them but Jesus alone.
     As they were going down the mountainside, Jesus cautioned them not
to relate what they had seen to anyone, until after the Son of Man had
risen from the dead. They seized on these words and discussed with one
another what this "rising from the dead" meant. 'How is it,' they asked
Jesus, 'that our teachers of the Law say that Elijah has to come first?'
     'Elijah does indeed come first,' answered Jesus, 'and re-establish
everything; and does not scripture speak, with regard to the Son of Man,
of his undergoing much suffering and being utterly despised? But I tell
you that Elijah has come, and people have treated him just as they
pleased, as scripture says of him.'
     When they came to the other disciples, they saw a great crowd round
them, and some teachers of the Law arguing with them. But, as soon as
they saw Jesus, all the people, in great astonishment, ran up and
greeted him. 'What are you arguing about with them?' Jesus asked.
'Teacher,' answered a man in the crowd, 'I brought my son to see you, as
he has a spirit in him that makes him mute; and, wherever it seizes him,
it dashes him down; he foams at the mouth and grinds his teeth, and he
is pining away. I asked your disciples to drive the spirit out, but they
failed.'
     'Faithless generation!' exclaimed Jesus. 'How long must I be with
you? How long must I have patience with you? Bring the boy to me.' They
brought him to Jesus; but no sooner did the boy see him than the spirit
threw him into convulsions; and he fell on the ground, and rolled about,
foaming at the mouth. 'How long has he been like this?' Jesus asked the
boy's father. 'From his childhood,' he answered. 'It has often thrown
him into fire and into water to put an end to his life; but, if you can
possibly do anything, take pity on us, and help us!' 'Why say
"possibly"?' Jesus replied. 'Everything is possible for one who has
faith.' The boy's father immediately cried out, 'I have faith; help my
want of faith!' But, when Jesus saw that a crowd was quickly collecting,
he rebuked the foul spirit, 'Deaf and dumb spirit, it is I who command
you. Come out from him and never enter him again.' With a loud cry the
spirit threw the boy into repeated convulsions, and then came out from
him. The boy looked like a corpse, so that most of them said that he was
dead. But Jesus took his hand, and lifted him; and he stood up.
     When Jesus had gone indoors, his disciples asked him privately,
'Why couldn't we drive it out?'
     'A spirit of this kind,' he said, 'can be driven out only by
prayer.'

     Leaving that place, Jesus and his disciples went on their way
through Galilee; but he did not wish anyone to know it, for he was
instructing his disciples, and telling them -- 'The Son of Man is being
betrayed into the hands of his fellow men, and they will put him to
death, but, when he has been put to death, he will rise again after
three days.' But the disciples did not understand his meaning and were
afraid to question him.
     They came to Capernaum. When Jesus had gone into the house, he
asked them, 'What were you discussing on the way?' But they were silent;
for on the way they had been arguing with one another which was the
greatest. Sitting down, Jesus called the Twelve and said, 'If anyone
wishes to be first, he must be last of all, and servant of all.' Then
Jesus took a little child, and placed it in the middle of them. Taking
it in his arms, he said to them, 'Anyone who, for the sake of my name,
welcomes even a little child like this is welcoming me, and anyone who
welcomes me is welcoming not me, but him who sent me as his messenger.'
     'Teacher,' said John, 'we saw a man driving out demons by using
your name, and we tried to prevent him, because he did not follow us.'
     'None of you must prevent the man,' answered Jesus, 'for no one
will use my name in working a miracle, and yet find it easy to speak
evil of me. He who is not against us is for us. If anyone gives you a
cup of water because you belong to Christ, I tell you, he will assuredly
not lose his reward.
     'And, if anyone puts temptation in the way of one of these little
ones who believe in me, it would be far better for him if he had been
thrown into the sea with a great millstone round his neck. If your hand
causes you to sin, cut it off. It would be better for you to enter the
life maimed, than to have both your hands and go into Gehenna, into the
fire that cannot be put out. {  (9:44)  Some later manuscripts add here
or at verse 46: where their worm never dies and the fire is never
quenched. } If your foot causes you to sin, cut it off. It would be
better for you to enter the life lame, than to have both your feet and
be thrown into Gehenna. {  (9:46)  See the note on verse 44. } If your
eye causes you to sin, tear it out. It would be better for you to enter
the kingdom of God with only one eye, than to have both eyes and be
thrown into Gehenna, where their worm does not die, and the fire is not
put out.
     For it is by fire that everyone will be salted.
     Salt is good, but, if the salt should lose its saltiness, what will
you use to season it?
     You must have salt in yourselves, and live at peace with one
another.'

*The Journey to Jerusalem*

     On leaving that place, Jesus went into the district of Judea on the
other side of the Jordan. Crowds gathered about him again; and again, as
usual, he began teaching them. Presently some Pharisees came up and, to
test him, asked, 'Has a husband the right to divorce his wife?'
     'What direction did Moses give you?' replied Jesus. 'Moses,' they
said, 'permitted a man to draw up in writing a notice of separation and
divorce his wife.'
     'It was owing to the hardness of your hearts,' said Jesus, 'that
Moses gave you this direction; but, at the beginning of the Creation,
"God made them male and female." "For this reason a man will leave his
father and mother, and the man and his wife will become one;" so that
they are no longer two, but one. What God himself, then, has yoked
together no one must separate.'
     When they were indoors, the disciples asked him again about this,
and he said, 'Anyone who divorces his wife and marries another woman is
guilty of adultery against his wife; and, if the woman divorces her
husband and marries another man, she is guilty of adultery.'
     Some of the people were bringing little children to Jesus, for him
to touch them; but the disciples rebuked those who had brought them.
When, however, Jesus saw this, he was indignant. 'Let the little
children come to me,' he said, 'do not hinder them; for it is to the
childlike that the kingdom of God belongs. I tell you, unless a person
receives the kingdom of God like a child, they will not enter it at
all.' Then he embraced the children, and, placing his hands on them,
gave them his blessing.
     As Jesus was resuming his journey, a man came running up to him,
and threw himself on his knees before him. 'Good teacher,' he asked,
'what must I do to gain eternal life?'
     'Why do you call me good?' answered Jesus. 'No one is good but God.
You know the commandments -- "Do not kill. Do not commit adultery. Do
not steal. Do not say what is false about others. Do not cheat. Honour
your father and your mother."'
     'Teacher,' he replied, 'I have observed all these from my
childhood.' Jesus looked at the man, and his heart went out to him, and
he said, 'There is still one thing wanting in you; go and sell all that
you have, and give to the poor, and you will have wealth in heaven; then
come and follow me.' But the man's face clouded at these words, and he
went away distressed, for he had great possessions.
     Then Jesus looked round, and said to his disciples, 'How hard it
will be for people of wealth to enter the kingdom of God!' The disciples
were amazed at his words. But Jesus said again, 'My children, how hard a
thing it is to enter the kingdom of God! It is easier for a camel to get
through a needle's eye, than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of
God.'
     'Then who can be saved?' they exclaimed in the greatest
astonishment. Jesus looked at them, and answered, 'With people it is
impossible, but not with God; for everything is possible with God.'
     'But we,' began Peter, 'we left everything and have followed you.'
     'I tell you,' said Jesus, 'there is no one who has left house, or
brothers, or sisters, or mother, or father, or children, or land, for my
sake and for the good news, who will not receive a hundred times as
much, even now in the present -- houses, and brothers, and sisters, and
mothers, and children, and land, though not without persecutions -- and
in the age that is coming, eternal life. But many who are first now will
then be last, and the last will be first.'

     They were on the road going up to Jerusalem, with Jesus walking in
front of them. The disciples were filled with awe, while those who were
following behind were overwhelmed with fear. Gathering the Twelve round
him once more, Jesus began to tell them what was about to happen to him.
'Listen!' he said. 'We are going up to Jerusalem; and there the Son of
Man will be betrayed to the chief priests and the teachers of the Law,
and they will condemn him to death, and they will give him up to the
Gentiles, who will mock him, spit on him, and scourge him, and put him
to death; and after three days he will rise again.'
     James and John, the two sons of Zebedee, went to Jesus, and said,
'Teacher, we want you to do for us whatever we ask.'
     'What do you want me to do for you?' he asked. 'Grant us this,'
they answered, 'to sit, one on your right, and the other on your left,
when you come in glory.'
     'You do not know what you are asking,' Jesus said to them. 'Can you
drink the cup that I am to drink? Or receive the baptism that I am to
receive?'
     'Yes,' they answered, 'we can.'
     'You will indeed drink the cup that I am to drink,' Jesus said,
'and receive the baptism that I am to receive, but as to a seat at my
right or at my left -- that is not mine to give, but it is for those for
whom it has been prepared.'
     On hearing of this, the ten others were at first very indignant
about James and John. But Jesus called the ten to him, and said, 'Those
who are regarded as ruling among the Gentiles lord it over them, as you
know, and their great men oppress them. But among you it is not so. No,
whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant, and
whoever wants to take the first place among you must be the servant of
all; for even the Son of Man came, not be served, but to serve, and to
give his life as a ransom for many.'
     They came to Jericho. When Jesus was going out of the town with his
disciples and a large crowd, Bartimaeus, the son of Timaeus, a blind
beggar, was sitting by the roadside. Hearing that it was Jesus the
Nazarene, he began to call out, 'Jesus, Son of David, take pity on me.'
Many of the people kept telling him to be quiet; but the man continued
to call out all the louder, 'Son of David, take pity on me.' Then Jesus
stopped. 'Call him,' he said. So they called the blind man. 'Have
courage!' they exclaimed. 'Get up; he is calling you.' The man threw off
his cloak, sprang up, and came to Jesus. 'What do you want me to do for
you?' said Jesus, addressing him. 'Rabboni,' the blind man answered, 'I
want to recover my sight.'
     'You may go,' Jesus said, 'Your faith has delivered you.'
Immediately he recovered his sight, and began to follow Jesus along the
road.

*The Last Days*

     When they had almost reached Jerusalem, as far as Bethphage and
Bethany, near the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent on two of his disciples.
'Go to the village facing you,' he said, 'and, as soon as you get there,
you will find a foal tethered, which no one has ever ridden; untie it,
and bring it. And, if anyone says to you "Why are you doing that?", say
"The Master wants it, and will be sure to send it back here at once."'
The two disciples went, and, finding a foal tethered outside a door in
the street, they untied it. Some of the bystanders said to them, 'What
are you doing, untying the foal?' And the two disciples answered as
Jesus had told them; and they allowed them to go. Then they brought the
foal to Jesus, and, when they had laid their cloaks on it, he seated
himself on it. Many of the people spread their cloaks on the road, while
some strewed boughs which they had cut from the fields; and those who
led the way, as well as those who followed, kept shouting, 'God save
him! Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord! Blessed is the
coming kingdom of our father David! God save him from on high!'
     Jesus entered Jerusalem, and went into the Temple Courts; and,
after looking round at everything, as it was already late, he went out
to Bethany with the Twelve.
     The next day, after they had left Bethany, Jesus became hungry;
and, noticing a fig tree at a distance in leaf, he went to it to see if
by any chance he could find something on it; but, on coming up to it, he
found nothing but leaves, for it was not the season for figs. So,
addressing the tree, he exclaimed, 'May no one ever again eat of your
fruit!' And his disciples heard what he said.
     They came to Jerusalem. Jesus went into the Temple Courts, and
began to drive out those who were buying and selling there. He
overturned the tables of the money changers, and the seats of the
pigeon-dealers, and would not allow anyone to carry anything across the
Temple Courts. Then he began to teach. 'Does not scripture say,' he
asked, '"My house will be called a house of prayer for all the nations"?
But you have made it a den of robbers.' Now the chief priests and the
teachers of the Law heard this and began to look for some way of putting
Jesus to death; for they were afraid of him, since all the people were
greatly impressed by his teaching. As soon as evening fell, Jesus and
his disciples went out of the city.
     As they passed by early in the morning, they noticed that the fig
tree was withered up from the roots. Then Peter recalled what had
occurred. 'Look, Rabbi,' he exclaimed, 'the fig tree which you doomed is
withered up!'
     'Have faith in God!' replied Jesus. 'I tell you that if anyone
should say to this hill "Be lifted up and hurled into the sea!", without
ever a doubt in his mind, but in the faith that what he says will be
done, he would find that it would be. And therefore I say to you "Have
faith that whatever you ask for in prayer is already granted you, and
you will find that it will be."
     'And, whenever you stand up to pray, forgive any grievance that you
have against anyone, so that your Father who is in heaven also may
forgive you your offences.' {  (11:26)  Some later manuscripts add: But
if you do not forgive, neither will your Father in heaven forgive your
offences. }

     They came to Jerusalem again. While Jesus was walking about in the
Temple Courts, the chief priests, the teachers of the Law, and the
elders came up to him. 'What authority have you to do these things?'
they said. 'Who gave you the authority to do them?'
     'I will put one question to you,' said Jesus. 'Answer me that, and
then I will tell you what authority I have to act as I do. It is about
John's baptism. Was it of divine or human origin? Answer me that.' They
began arguing together. 'If we say "divine," he will say "Why then
didn't you believe him?" Yet can we say "human"?' They were afraid of
the people, for everyone regarded John as undoubtedly a prophet. So
their answer to Jesus was -- 'We do not know.'
     'Then I,' replied Jesus, 'refuse to tell you what authority I have
to do these things.'
     Jesus began to speak to them in parables, 'A man once planted a
vineyard, put a fence round it, dug a wine-press, built a tower, and
then let it out to tenants and went abroad. At the proper time he sent a
servant to the tenants, to receive from them a share of the produce of
the grape harvest; but they seized him, and beat him, and sent him away
empty-handed. A second time the owner sent a servant to them; this man,
too, the tenants struck on the head, and insulted. He sent another, but
him they killed; and so with many others -- some they beat and some they
killed. He had still one son, who was very dear to him; and him he sent
to them last of all. "They will respect my son," he said. But those
tenants said to one another "Here is the heir! Come, let us kill him,
and his inheritance will be ours." So they seized him, and killed him,
and threw his body outside the vineyard. What will the owner of the
vineyard do? He will come and put the tenants to death, and he will let
the vineyard to others.
     'Have you never read this passage of scripture? -- "The stone which
the builders despised has now itself become the cornerstone; this
cornerstone has come from the Lord, and is marvellous in our eyes."'
     After this his enemies were eager to arrest him, but they were
afraid of the crowd; for they saw that it was at them that he had aimed
the parable. So they left him alone, and went away.

     Afterwards they sent to Jesus some of the Pharisees and Herodians,
to set a trap for him in the course of conversation. These men came to
him and said, 'Teacher, we know that you are an honest man, and are not
afraid of anyone, for you pay no regard to a person's position, but
teach the way of God honestly; are we right in paying taxes to the
Emperor, or not? Should we pay, or should we not pay?' Knowing their
hypocrisy, Jesus said to them, 'Why are you testing me? Bring me a coin
to look at.' And, when they had brought it, he asked, 'Whose head and
title are these?'
     'The Emperor's,' they said; and Jesus replied, 'Pay to the Emperor
what belongs to the Emperor, and to God what belongs to God.' And they
were amazed at him.
     Next came some Sadducees -- the men who maintain that there is no
resurrection. Their question was this -- 'Teacher, in our scriptures
Moses decreed that, should a man's brother die, leaving a widow but no
child, the man should take the widow as his wife, and raise up a family
for his brother. There were once seven brothers. The eldest married, but
died and left no family; and the second married his widow, and died
without family; and so did the third. All the seven died and left no
family. The woman herself died last of all. At the resurrection whose
wife will she be, all seven brothers having had her as their wife?'
     'Is not the reason of your mistake,' answered Jesus, 'your
ignorance of the scriptures and of the power of God? When people rise
from the dead, there is no marrying or being married; but they are as
angels in heaven.
     'As to the dead, and the fact that they rise, have you never read
in the book of Moses, in the passage about the Bush, how God spoke to
him saying -- "I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the
God of Jacob"? He is not God of dead people, but of living. You are
greatly mistaken.'
     Then came up one of the teachers of the Law who had heard their
discussions. Knowing that Jesus had answered them wisely, he asked him
this question, 'Which commandment is the most important of all?'
     'The most important,' answered Jesus, 'is -- "Hear, Israel; the
Lord our God is the one Lord; and you must love the Lord your God with
all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind, and with
all your strength." The second is this -- "You must love your neighbour
as you love yourself." There is no commandment greater than these.'
     'Wisely answered, teacher!' exclaimed the teacher of the Law. 'It
is true, as you say, that there is one God, and that there is no other
besides him; and to love him with all one's heart, and with all one's
understanding, and with all one's strength, and to love one's neighbour
as one loves oneself is far beyond all burnt offerings and sacrifices.'
Seeing that he had answered with discernment, Jesus said to him, 'You
are not far from the kingdom of God.'
     After that no one ventured to question him further.
     While Jesus was teaching in the Temple Courts, he asked, 'How is it
that the teachers of the Law say that the Christ is to be David's son?
David said himself, speaking under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit --
"The Lord said to my lord: Sit at my right hand, until I put your
enemies beneath your feet." David himself calls him "lord," how comes
it, then, that he is to be his son?'
     The mass of the people listened to Jesus with delight. In the
course of his teaching, Jesus said, 'See that you are on your guard
against the teachers of the Law, who delight to walk about in long
robes, and to be greeted in the streets with respect, and to have the
best seats in the synagogues, and places of honour at dinner. They are
the men who rob widows of their homes, and make a pretence of saying
long prayers. Their sentence will be all the heavier.'
     Then Jesus sat down opposite the chests for the Temple offerings,
and watched how the people put money into them. Many rich people were
putting in large sums; but one poor widow came and put in two small
coins, worth very little. Then, calling his disciples to him, Jesus
said, 'I tell you that this poor widow has put in more than all the
others who were putting money into the chests; for everyone else put in
something from what he had to spare, while she, in her need, put in all
she had -- everything that she had to live on.'

     As Jesus was walking out of the Temple Courts, one of his disciples
said to him, 'Teacher, look what fine stones and buildings these are!'
     'Do you see these great buildings?' asked Jesus. 'Not a single
stone will be left here on another, which will not be thrown down.'
     When Jesus had sat down on the Mount of Olives, facing the Temple,
Peter, James, John and Andrew questioned him privately, 'Tell us when
this will be, and what will be the sign when all this is drawing to its
close.'
     Then Jesus began, 'See that no one leads you astray. Many will take
my name, and come saying "I am He", and will lead many astray.
     'And, when you hear of wars and rumours of wars, do not be alarmed;
such things must occur; but the end is not yet. For nation will rise
against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; there will be earthquakes
in various places; there will be famines. This will be but the beginning
of the birth-pangs.
     'See to yourselves! They will betray you to courts of law; and you
will be taken to synagogues and beaten; and you will be brought up
before governors and kings for my sake, so that you can bear witness
before them. But the good news must first be proclaimed to every nation.
Whenever they betray you and hand you over for trial, do not be anxious
beforehand as to what you will say, but say whatever is given you at the
moment; for it will not be you who speak, but the Holy Spirit. Brother
will betray brother to death, and the father his child; and children
will turn against their parents, and cause them to be put to death; and
you will be hated by everyone because of me. Yet the person who endures
to the end will be saved.
     'As soon, however, as you see "the Foul Desecration" standing where
it ought not' (the reader must consider what this means) 'then those of
you who are in Judea must take refuge in the mountains; and a person on
the house-top must not go down, or go in to get anything out of their
house: nor must one who is on their farm turn back to get their cloak.
And alas for pregnant women, and for those who are nursing infants in
those days! Pray, too, that this may not occur in winter. For those days
will be a time of distress, the like of which has not occurred from the
beginning of God's creation until now -- and never will again. And, had
not the Lord put a limit to those days, not a single soul would escape;
but, for the sake of God's own chosen people, he did limit them.
     'And at that time if anyone should say to you "Look, here is the
Christ!" "Look, there he is!", do not believe it; for false Christs and
false prophets will arise, and display signs and marvels, to lead
astray, were it possible, even God's people. But see that you are on
your guard! I have told you all this beforehand.
     'In those days, after that time of distress, the sun will be
darkened, the moon will not give her light, the stars will be falling
from the heavens, and the forces that are in the heavens will be
convulsed. Then will be seen the Son of Man coming in clouds with great
power and glory; and then he will send the angels, and gather his people
from the four winds, from one end of the world to the other.
     'Learn the lesson taught by the fig tree. As soon as its branches
are full of sap, and it is bursting into leaf, you know that summer is
near. And so may you, as soon as you see these things happening, know
that he is at your doors. I tell you that even the present generation
will not pass away, until all these things have taken place. The heavens
and the earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away.
     'But about that day, or the hour, no one knows -- not even the
angels in heaven, not even the Son -- but only the Father.
     'See that you are on the watch; for you do not know when the time
will be. It is like a man going on a journey, who leaves his home, puts
his servants in charge -- each having their special duty -- and orders
the porter to watch. Therefore watch, for you cannot be sure when the
Master of the house is coming -- whether in the evening, at midnight, at
daybreak, or in the morning -- otherwise he might come suddenly and find
you asleep. And what I say to you I say to all -- Watch!'

     It was now two days before the Festival of the Passover and the
unleavened bread. The chief priests and the teachers of the Law were
looking for an opportunity to arrest Jesus by stealth, and to put him to
death; for they said, 'Not during the Festival, or the people may riot.'
     When Jesus was still at Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper,
while he was sitting at the table, a woman came with an alabaster jar of
choice spikenard perfume of great value. She broke the jar, and poured
the perfume on his head. Some of those who were present said to one
another indignantly, 'Why has the perfume been wasted like this? This
perfume could have been sold for more than a year's wages, and the money
given to the poor.'
     'Leave her alone,' said Jesus, as they began to find fault with
her, 'why are you troubling her? This is a beautiful deed that she has
done for me. You always have the poor with you, and whenever you wish
you can do good to them; but you will not always have me. She has done
what she could; she has perfumed my body beforehand for my burial. And I
tell you, wherever, in the whole world, the good news is proclaimed,
what this woman has done will be told in memory of her.'
     After this, Judas Iscariot, one of the Twelve, went to the chief
priests, to betray Jesus to them. They were glad to hear what he said,
and promised to pay him. So he began looking for a good opportunity to
betray Jesus.

     On the first day of the Festival of the unleavened bread, when it
was customary to kill the Passover lambs, his disciples said to Jesus,
'Where do you wish us to go and make preparations for your eating the
Passover?' Jesus sent forward two of his disciples and said to them, 'Go
into the city, and there a man carrying a pitcher of water will meet
you; follow him; and, wherever he goes in, say to the owner of the house
"The teacher says -- Where is my room where I am to eat the Passover
with my disciples?" He will himself show you a large upstairs room, set
out ready; and there make preparations for us.' So the disciples set out
and went into the city, and found everything just as Jesus had told
them; and they prepared the Passover.
     In the evening he went there with the Twelve, and when they had
taken their places and were eating, Jesus said, 'I tell you that one of
you is going to betray me -- one who is eating with me.' They were
grieved at this, and began to say to him, one after another, 'Can it be
I?'
     'It is one of you Twelve,' said Jesus, 'the one who is dipping his
bread beside me into the dish. True, the Son of Man must go, as
scripture says of him, yet alas for that man by whom the Son of Man is
being betrayed! For that man it would be better never to have been
born!'
     While they were eating, Jesus took some bread, and, after saying
the blessing, broke it, and gave it to them, and said, 'Take it; this is
my body.' Then he took a cup, and, after saying the thanksgiving, gave
it to them, and they all drank from it. 'This is my covenant-blood,' he
said, 'which is poured out on behalf of many. I tell you that I will
never again drink of the fruit of the vine, until that day when I will
drink it new in the kingdom of God.'
     They then sang a hymn, and went out up the Mount of Olives,
presently Jesus said to them, 'All of you will fall away; for scripture
says -- "I will strike down the shepherd, and the sheep will be
scattered." Yet, after I have risen, I will go before you into Galilee.'
     'Even if everyone else falls away,' said Peter, 'I will not.'
     'I tell you,' answered Jesus, 'that you yourself today -- yes, this
very night -- before the cock crows twice, will disown me three times.'
But Peter vehemently protested, 'Even if I must die with you, I will
never disown you!' And they all said the same.

     Presently they came to a garden known as Gethsemane, and Jesus said
to his disciples 'Sit down here while I pray.' He took with him Peter,
James, and John; and began to show signs of great dismay and deep
distress of mind. 'I am sad at heart,' he said, 'sad even to death; wait
here, and watch.' Going on a little further, he threw himself on the
ground, and began to pray that, if it were possible, he might be spared
that hour. 'Abba, Father,' he said, 'all things are possible to you;
take away this cup from me; yet, not what I will, but what you will.'
     Then he came and found the three apostles asleep. 'Simon,' he said
to Peter, 'are you asleep? Couldn't you watch for one hour? Watch and
pray,' he said to them all, 'so that you may not fall into temptation.
True, the spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.' Again he went away,
and prayed in the same words; and coming back again he found them
asleep, for their eyes were heavy; and they did not know what to say to
him.
     A third time he came, and said to them, 'Sleep on now, and rest
yourselves. Enough! My time has come. Look, the Son of Man is being
betrayed into the hands of wicked people. Up, and let us be going. Look!
My betrayer is close at hand.'
     And just then, while he was still speaking, Judas, who was one of
the Twelve, came up; and with him a crowd of people, with swords and
clubs, sent by the chief priests, the teachers of the Law, and the
elders. Now the betrayer had arranged a signal with them. 'The man whom
I kiss,' he had said, 'will be the one; arrest him and take him away
safely.' As soon as Judas came, he went up to Jesus at once, and said,
'Rabbi!' and kissed him. Then the men seized Jesus, and arrested him.
     One of those who were standing by drew his sword, and struck at the
high priest's servant, and cut off his ear. But Jesus spoke up, and said
to the men, 'Have you come out, as if after a robber, with swords and
clubs, to take me? I have been among you day after day in the Temple
Courts teaching, and yet you did not arrest me; but this is in
fulfilment of the scriptures.' And all the apostles deserted him and
fled. One young man did indeed follow him, wrapped only in a linen
sheet. They tried to arrest him; but he left the sheet in their hands,
and fled naked.

     Then they took Jesus to the high priest; and all the chief priests,
elders, and the teachers of the Law assembled. Peter, who had followed
Jesus at a distance into the courtyard of the high priest, was sitting
there among the guards, warming himself at the blaze of the fire.
     Meanwhile the chief priest and the whole of the High Council were
trying to get such evidence against Jesus as would warrant his being put
to death, but they could not find any; for, though there were many who
gave false evidence against him, yet their evidence did not agree.
Presently some men stood up, and gave this false evidence against him --
'We ourselves heard him say "I will destroy this Temple made with hands,
and in three days build another made without hands."' Yet not even on
that point did their evidence agree.
     Then the high priest stood forward, and questioned Jesus. 'Have you
no answer to make?' he asked. 'What is this evidence which these men are
giving against you?' But Jesus remained silent, and made no answer.
     A second time the high priest questioned him. 'Are you,' he asked,
'the Christ, the Son of the Blessed One?'
     'I am,' replied Jesus, 'and you will all see the Son of Man sitting
on the right hand of the Almighty, and coming in the clouds of heaven.'
At this the high priest tore his vestments. 'Why do we want any more
witnesses?' he exclaimed. 'You heard his blasphemy? What is your
verdict?' They all condemned him, declaring that he deserved death.
     Some of those present began to spit at him, and to blindfold his
eyes, and strike him, saying, as they did so, 'Now play the prophet!'
and even the guards received him with blows.
     While Peter was in the courtyard down below, one of the high
priest's maidservants came up; and, seeing Peter warming himself, she
looked closely at him, and exclaimed, 'Why, you were with Jesus, the
Nazarene!' But Peter denied it. 'I do not know or understand what you
mean,' he replied. Then he went out into the porch; and there the
maidservant, on seeing him, began to say again to the bystanders, 'This
is one of them!' But Peter again denied it.
     Soon afterwards the bystanders again said to him, 'You certainly
are one of them; why you are a Galilean!' But he said to them, 'I swear
that I do not know the man you are talking about! May God punish me if I
am lying!' At that moment, for the second time, a cock crowed; and Peter
remembered the words that Jesus had said to him -- "Before a cock has
crowed twice, you will disown me three times"; and, as he thought of it,
he began to weep.

     As soon as it was daylight, the chief priests, after holding a
consultation with elders and teachers of the Law -- that is to say, the
whole High Council -- put Jesus in chains, and took him away, and gave
him up to Pilate. 'Are you the king of the Jews?' asked Pilate. 'It is
true,' replied Jesus. Then the chief priests brought a number of charges
against him. So Pilate questioned Jesus again. 'Have you no reply to
make?' he asked. 'Listen, how many charges they are bringing against
you.' But Jesus still made no reply whatever; at which Pilate was
astonished.
     Now, at the feast, Pilate used to grant the people the release of
any one prisoner whom they might ask for. A man called Barabbas was in
prison, with the rioters who had committed murder during a riot. So,
when the crowd went up and began to ask Pilate to follow his usual
custom, he answered, 'Do you want me to release the "king of the Jews"
for you?' For he was aware that it was out of jealousy that the chief
priests had given Jesus up to him. But the chief priests incited the
crowd to get Barabbas released instead. Pilate, however, spoke to them
again, 'What should I do then with the man whom you call the "king of
the Jews"?' Again they shouted, 'Crucify him!'
     'Why, what harm has he done?' Pilate kept saying to them. But they
shouted furiously, 'Crucify him!' And Pilate, wishing to satisfy the
crowd, released Barabbas to them, and, after scourging Jesus, gave him
up to be crucified.
     The soldiers then took Jesus away into the courtyard -- that is the
Government house -- and they called the whole garrison together. They
dressed him in a purple robe, and, having twisted a crown of thorns, put
it on him, and then began to salute him. 'Long life to you, king of the
Jews!' they said. And they kept striking him on the head with a rod,
spitting at him, and bowing to the ground before him -- going down on
their knees; and, when they had left off mocking him, they took off the
purple robe, and put his own clothes on him.

     They led Jesus out to crucify him; and they compelled a passer-by,
Simon from Cyrene, who was on his way in from the country, the father of
Alexander and Rufus, to go with them to carry his cross.
     They brought Jesus to the place which was known as Golgotha -- a
name which means "place of a Skull." There they offered him drugged
wine; but Jesus refused it. Then they crucified him, and divided his
clothes among them, casting lots for them, to settle what each should
take.
     It was nine in the morning when they crucified him. The words of
the charge against him, written up over his head, read -- "THE KING OF
THE JEWS." And with him they crucified two robbers, one on the right,
and the other on the left. {  (15:28)  Some later manuscripts add: And
the scripture was fulfilled that says, "He was counted among outlaws." }
     The passers-by railed at him, shaking their heads, as they said,
'Ah! You who would destroy the Temple and build one in three days, come
down from the cross and save yourself!' In the same way the chief
priests, with the teachers of the Law, said to one another in mockery,
'He saved others, but he cannot save himself! Let the Christ, the "king
of Israel," come down from the cross now so that we can see it and
believe.' Even the men who had been crucified with Jesus insulted him.
     At midday, a darkness came over the whole country, lasting until
three in the afternoon. And, at three, Jesus called out loudly, 'Eloi,
Eloi, lama sabacthani?' which means "My God, my God, why have you
forsaken me?" Some of those standing round heard this, and said,
'Listen! He is calling for Elijah!' And a man ran, and, soaking a sponge
in common wine, put it on the end of a rod, and offered it to him to
drink, saying as he did so, 'Wait and let us see if Elijah is coming to
take him down.' But Jesus, giving a loud cry, breathed his last. The
Temple curtain was torn in two from top to bottom. The Roman officer,
who was standing facing Jesus, on seeing the way in which he breathed
his last, exclaimed, 'This man must indeed have been God's son!'

     There were some women also watching from a distance, among them
being Mary of Magdala, Mary the mother of James the Little and of
Joseph, and Salome -- all of whom used to accompany Jesus when he was in
Galilee, and give him support -- besides many other women who had come
up with him to Jerusalem.
     The evening had already fallen, when, as it was the Preparation day
-- the day before the Sabbath -- Joseph from Arimathea, a councillor of
good position, who was himself living in expectation of the kingdom of
God, came and ventured to go in to see Pilate, and to ask for the body
of Jesus. But Pilate was surprised to hear that he had already died. So
he sent for the officer, and asked if he were already dead; and, on
learning from the officer that it was so, he gave the corpse to Joseph.
Joseph, having bought a linen sheet, took Jesus down, and wound the
sheet round him, and laid him in a tomb which had been cut out of the
rock; and then rolled a stone up against the entrance of the tomb. Mary
of Magdala and Mary, the mother of Joseph, were watching to see where he
was laid.

*The Risen Life Announced*

     When the Sabbath was over, Mary of Magdala, Mary the mother of
James, and Salome bought some spices, so that they might go and anoint
the body of Jesus. Very early on the first day of the week they went to
the tomb, after sunrise. They were saying to one another, 'Who will roll
away the stone for us from the entrance of the tomb?' But, on looking
up, they saw that the stone had already been rolled back; it was a very
large one. Going into the tomb, they saw a young man sitting on their
right, in a white robe, and they were dismayed; but he said to them, 'Do
not be dismayed; you are looking for Jesus, the Nazarene, who has been
crucified; he has risen, he is not here! Look! Here is the place where
they laid him. But go, and say to his disciples and to Peter "He is
going before you into Galilee; there you will see him, as he told you."'
They went out, and fled from the tomb, for they were trembling and
bewildered; and they did not say a word to anyone, for they were
frightened.

*A late appendix*



*(Inserted in some manuscripts from an ancient source)*

     After his rising again, early on the first day of the week, Jesus
appeared first of all to Mary of Magdala, from whom he had driven out
seven demons. She went and told the news to those who had been with him
and who were now in sorrow and tears; yet even they, when they heard
that he was alive and had been seen by her, did not believe it.
Afterwards, altered in appearance, he made himself known to two of them,
as they were walking, on their way into the country. They also went and
told the rest, but they did not believe even them. Later on, he made
himself known to the Eleven themselves as they were at a meal, and
reproached them with their want of faith and their stubbornness, because
they did not believe those who had seen him after he had risen from the
dead. Then he said to them, 'Go into all the world, and proclaim the
good news to all creation. He who believes and is baptised will be
saved; but he who refuses to believe will be condemned. Moreover these
signs will attend those who believe. In my name they will drive out
demons; they will speak in new languages; they will take up snakes in
their hands; and, if they drink any poison, it will not hurt them; they
will place their hands on sick people and they will recover.' So the
Lord Jesus, after he had spoken to them, was taken up into heaven, and
sat at the right hand of God. But they set out, and made the
proclamation everywhere, the Lord working with them, and confirming the
message by the signs which attended it.

*Another appendix*

    But all that had been revealed to them they reported briefly to
Peter and his companions. Afterwards Jesus himself sent out through
them, from east to west, the sacred and imperishable proclamation of
eternal salvation.

                         GOOD NEWS ACCORDING TO
                                  LUKE


*Dedication*

     To his Excellency, Theophilus.
     Many attempts have been already made to draw up an account of those
events which have reached their conclusion among us, just as they were
reported to us by those who from the beginning were eye-witnesses, and
afterwards became bearers of the message. And, therefore, I also, since
I have investigated all these events with great care from their very
beginning, have resolved to write a connected history of them for you,
in order that you may be able to satisfy yourself of the accuracy of the
story which you have heard from the lips of others.

*Birth, Parentage, Infancy and Boyhood*

     In the reign of Herod, king of Judea, there was a priest named
Zechariah, who belonged to the division called after Abijah. His wife,
whose name was Elizabeth, was also a descendant of Aaron. They were both
righteous people, who lived blameless lives, guiding their steps by all
the commandments and ordinances of the Lord. But they had no child,
Elizabeth being barren; and both of them were advanced in years.
     One day, when Zechariah was officiating as priest before God,
during the turn of his division, it fell to him by lot, in accordance
with the practice among the priests, to go into the Temple of the Lord
and burn incense; and, as it was the Hour of Incense, the people were
all praying outside. And an angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing
on the right of the Altar of Incense. Zechariah was startled at the
sight and was awe-struck. But the angel said to him, 'Do not be afraid,
Zechariah; your prayer has been heard, and your wife Elizabeth will bear
you a son, whom you will call by the name John. He will be to you a joy
and a delight; and many will rejoice over his birth. For he will be
great in the sight of the Lord; he will not drink any wine or strong
drink, and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit from the very hour of
his birth, and will reconcile many of the Israelites to the Lord their
God. He will go before him in the spirit and with the power of Elijah,
to reconcile fathers to their children and the disobedient to the wisdom
of the righteous, and so make ready for the Lord a people prepared for
him.'
     'How can I be sure of this?' Zechariah asked the angel. 'For I am
an old man and my wife is advanced in years.'
     'I am Gabriel,' the angel answered, 'who stands in the presence of
God, and I have been sent to speak to you and to bring you this good
news. And now you will be silent and unable to speak until the day when
this takes place, because you did not believe what I said, though my
words will be fulfilled in due course.'
     Meanwhile the people were watching for Zechariah, wondering at his
remaining so long in the Temple. When he came out, he was unable to
speak to them, and they perceived that he had seen a vision there. But
Zechariah kept making signs to them, and remained dumb. And, as soon as
his term of service was finished, he returned home. After this his wife,
Elizabeth, became pregnant and lived in seclusion for five months. 'The
Lord has done this for me,' she said, 'he has shown me kindness and
taken away the public disgrace of childlessness under which I have been
living.'

     Six months later the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a town in
Galilee called Nazareth, to a maiden there who was engaged to a man
named Joseph, a descendant of David. Her name was Mary. Gabriel came
into her presence and greeted her, saying, 'You have been shown great
favour -- the Lord is with you.'
     Mary was much disturbed at his words, and was wondering to herself
what such a greeting could mean, when the angel spoke again, 'Do not be
afraid, Mary, for you have found favour with God. And now, you will
conceive and give birth to a son, and you will give him the name Jesus.
The child will be great and will be called "Son of the Most High," and
the Lord God will give him the throne of his ancestor David, and he will
reign over the descendants of Jacob for ever; And to his kingdom there
will be no end.'
     'How can this be?' Mary asked the angel. 'For I have no husband.'
     'The Holy Spirit will descend on you,' answered the angel, 'and the
Power of the Most High will overshadow you; and therefore the child will
be called "holy," and "Son of God." And Elizabeth, your cousin, is
herself also expecting a son in her old age; and it is now the sixth
month with her, though she is called barren; for no promise from God
will fail to be fulfilled.'
     'I am the servant of the Lord,' exclaimed Mary. 'Let it be with me
as you have said.' Then the angel left her.
     Soon after this Mary set out, and made her way quickly into the
hill-country, to a town in Judah; and there she went into Zechariah's
house and greeted Elizabeth. When Elizabeth heard Mary's greeting, the
child moved within her, and Elizabeth herself was filled with the Holy
Spirit, and cried aloud, 'Blessed are you among women, and blessed is
your unborn child! But how have I this honour, that the mother of my
Lord should come to me? For, as soon as your greeting reached my ears,
the child moved within me with delight! Happy indeed is she who believed
that the promise which she received from the Lord would be fulfilled.'
     And Mary said:

     'My soul exalts the Lord,
         and my spirit delights in God my Saviour,
     for he has looked with favour on his humble servant girl.
         From now on all generations will call me blessed!


     'For the Almighty has done great things for me,
         and holy is his name.
     He has mercy on those who revere him
         in every generation.


     'Mighty are the deeds of his arm!
         He has scattered the self-satisfied proud,
     he has cast down the mighty from their thrones,
         and he uplifts the humble,
     he has filled the hungry with good things,
         and the rich he has sent away empty.


     'He has stretched out his hand to his servant Israel,
         ever mindful of his mercy,
     as he promised to our ancestors,
         to Abraham and his descendants for ever.'
 Mary stayed with Elizabeth about three months, and then returned to her
home. When Elizabeth's time came, she gave birth to a son; and her
neighbours and relatives, hearing of the great goodness of the Lord to
her, came to share her joy. A week later they met to circumcise the
child, and were about to call him Zechariah after his father, when his
mother spoke up, 'No, he is to be called John.'
     'You have no relation of that name!' they exclaimed; and they made
signs to the child's father, to find out what he wished the child to be
called. Asking for a writing tablet, he wrote the words -- "His name is
John." Everyone was surprised and immediately Zechariah recovered his
voice and the use of his tongue, and began to bless God. All their
neighbours were awe-struck at this, and throughout the hill-country of
Judea the whole story was much talked about. All who heard it kept it in
mind, asking one another -- 'What can this child be destined to become?'
For the Power of the Lord was with him.
     Then his father Zechariah was filled with the Holy Spirit, and,
speaking under inspiration, said:

     'Blessed is the Lord, the God of Israel,
         who has visited his people and wrought their deliverance,
     and has raised up for us the strength of our salvation
         in the house of his servant David --
     as he promised by the lips of his holy prophets of old --
         salvation from our enemies and from the hands of all who hate
us,
     showing mercy to our ancestors,
         and mindful of his sacred covenant.


     This was the oath which he swore to our ancestor Abraham --
         that we should be rescued from the hands of our enemies,
     and should serve him without fear in holiness and righteousness,
         in his presence all our days.


     And you, child, will be called prophet of the Most High,
         for you will go before the Lord to make ready his way,
     to give his people the knowledge of salvation
         through the forgiveness of their sins,
     through the tender mercy of our God,
         whereby the dawn will break on us from heaven,
     to give light to those who live in darkness and the shadow of
death,
         and guide our feet into the way of peace.'
 The child grew and became strong in spirit, and he lived in the wilds
until the time came for his appearance before Israel.
     About that time an edict was issued by the Emperor Augustus that a
census should be taken of the whole Empire. (This was the first census
taken while Quirinius was Governor of Syria). And everyone went to his
own town to be registered. Among others Joseph went up from the town of
Nazareth in Galilee to Bethlehem, the town of David, in Judea -- because
he belonged to the family and house of David -- to be registered with
Mary, his engaged wife, who was about to become a mother. While they
were there her time came, and she gave birth to her first child, a son.
And because there was no room for them in the inn, she swathed him round
and laid him in a manger. In that same countryside were shepherds out in
the open fields, watching their flocks that night, when an angel of the
Lord suddenly stood by them, and the glory of the Lord shone around
them; and they were seized with fear. 'Have no fear,' the angel said.
'For I bring you good news of a great joy in store for all the nation.
This day there has been born to you, in the town of David, a Saviour,
who is Christ and Lord. And this will be the sign for you. You will find
the infant swathed, and lying in a manger.'
     Then suddenly there appeared with the angel a multitude of the
heavenly Host, praising God, and singing --

     'glory to God on high,
         and on earth peace among those in whom he finds pleasure.'
 Now, when the angels had left them and gone back to heaven, the
shepherds said to one another, 'Let us go at once to Bethlehem, and see
this thing that has happened, of which the Lord has told us.' So they
went quickly, and found Mary and Joseph, and the infant lying in a
manger; and, when they saw it, they told of all that had been said to
them about this child. All who heard the shepherds were astonished at
their story, while Mary treasured in her heart all that they said, and
thought about it often. And the shepherds went back, giving glory and
praise to God for all that they had heard and seen. It had all happened
as they had been told.

     Eight days after the birth of the child, when it was time to
circumcise him, he received the name Jesus -- the name given him by the
angel before his conception.

     When the period of purification of mother and child, required by
the Law of Moses, came to an end, his parents took the child up to
Jerusalem to present him to the Lord, in compliance with the Law of the
Lord that every firstborn male will be dedicated to the Lord, and also
to offer the sacrifice required by the Law of the Lord -- a pair of
turtle-doves or two young pigeons.
     There was at that time in Jerusalem a man named Simeon, a righteous
and devout man, who lived in constant expectation of  Israel's
consulation, and under the guidance of the Holy Spirit. It had been
revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he should not die until he had
seen the Lord's Christ. Moved by the Spirit, Simeon came into the Temple
Courts, and, when the parents brought in the child Jesus, to do for him
what was customary under the Law, Simeon himself took the child in his
arms, and blessed God, and said:

     'Now, Lord, you will let your servant go,
         according to your word, in peace,
     for my eyes have seen the salvation
         which you have prepared in the sight of all nations --
     a light to bring light to the Gentiles,
         and to be the glory of your people Israel.'
     While the child's father and mother were wondering at what was said
about him, Simeon gave them his blessing, and said to Mary, the child's
mother, 'This child is appointed to be the cause of the fall and rise of
many in Israel, and to be a sign much spoken against -- Yes, the sword
will pierce your own heart -- and so the thoughts in many minds will be
disclosed.'
     There was also a prophet named Hannah, a daughter of Phanuel and of
the tribe of Asher. She was far advanced in years, having lived with her
husband for seven years after marriage, and then a widow, until she had
reached the age of eighty-four. She never left the Temple Courts, but,
fasting and praying, worshiped God night and day. At that moment she
came up, and began publicly to thank God and to speak about the child to
all who were looking for the deliverance of Jerusalem.
     When the child's parents had done everything required by the Law of
the Lord, they returned to Galilee to their own town of Nazareth. The
child grew and became strong and wise, and the blessing of God was on
him.

     Every year the child's parents used to go to Jerusalem at the
Passover Festival. When Jesus was twelve years old, they went according
to custom to Jerusalem, and had finished their visit; but, when they
started to return, the boy Jesus remained behind in Jerusalem, without
their knowing it. Thinking that he was with their fellow travellers,
they went one day's journey before searching for him among their
relatives and acquaintances; and then, as they did not find him, they
returned to Jerusalem, searching everywhere for him. It was not until
the third day that they found him in the Temple Courts, sitting among
the teachers, now listening to them, now asking them questions. All who
listened to him marvelled at his intelligence and his answers.
     His parents were amazed when they saw him, and his mother said to
him, 'My child, why have you treated us like this? Your father and I
have been searching for you in great distress.'
     'What made you search for me?' he answered. 'Didn't you know that I
must be in my Father's house?' His parents did not understand what he
meant. However he went down with them to Nazareth, and submitted himself
to their control; and his mother treasured all that was said in her
heart. And Jesus grew in wisdom as he grew in years, and gained the
blessing of God and people.

*The Preparation*

     In the fifteenth year of the reign of the Emperor Tiberius, when
Pontius Pilate was governor of Judea, Herod ruler of Galilee, his
brother Philip ruler of the territory comprising Ituraea and
Trachonitis, and Lysanias ruler of Abilene, and when Annas and Caiaphas
were high priests, a command from God came to John, the son of
Zechariah, while he was in the wilderness. And John went through the
whole district of the Jordan, proclaiming a baptism of repentance, for
the forgiveness of sins. This was in fulfilment of what is said in the
writings of the prophet Isaiah --

     "The voice of one crying aloud in the wilderness:
     'Make ready the way of the Lord,
         make his paths straight.
     Every chasm will be filled,
         every mountain and hill will be levelled.
     The winding ways will be straightened,
         the rough roads made smooth,
             and everyone will see the salvation of God.'"
 And John said to the crowds that went to be baptised by him, 'You
children of snakes! Who has prompted you to seek refuge from the coming
judgment? Let your lives, then, prove your repentance; and do not begin
to say among yourselves "Abraham is our ancestor," for I tell you that
out of these stones God is able to raise descendants for Abraham!
Already, indeed, the axe is lying at the root of the trees. Therefore
every tree that fails to bear good fruit will be cut down and thrown
into the fire.'
     'What are we to do then?' the people asked. 'Let anyone who has two
coats,' answered John, 'share with the person who has none; and anyone
who has food do the same.'
     Even tax collectors came to be baptised, and said to John,
'Teacher, what are we to do?'
     'Do not collect more than you have authority to demand,' John
answered. And when some soldiers on active service asked 'And we -- what
are we to do?' he said, 'Never use violence, or exact anything by false
accusation; and be content with your pay.'
     Then, while the people were in suspense, and were all debating with
themselves whether John could be the Christ, John, addressing them all,
said, 'I, indeed, baptise you with water; but there is coming one more
powerful than I, and I am not fit even to unfasten his sandals. He will
baptise you with the Holy Spirit and with fire. His winnowing-fan is in
his hand so that he may clear his threshing-floor, and store the grain
in his barn, but the chaff he will burn with a fire that cannot be put
out.'
     And so with many different appeals John told his good news to the
people. But when John rebuked Herod the ruler, for Herodia his brother's
wife, and for all the evil things that he had done, Herod crowned them
all by shutting John up in prison.

     Now after the baptism of all the people, and when Jesus had been
baptised and was still praying, the heavens opened, and the Holy Spirit
came down on him in the form of a dove, and from the heavens came a
voice -- 'You are my dearly loved son; you bring me great joy.'
     When beginning his work, Jesus was about thirty years old. He was
regarded as the son of Joseph, whose ancestors were --

     Eli, Mattith, Levi, Melchiah, Janna, Joseph, Mattithiah, Amos,
Nahum, Azaliah, Nogah, Mattith, Mattithiah, Shimei, Joseph, Josheh,
Johanan, Rhesa, Zerubbabel, Salathiel, Neriah, Melchiah, Addi, Cosam,
Elmodam, Er, Joshua, Eliezer, Joram, Mattith, Levi, Simeon, Judah,
Joseph, Jonam, Eliakim, Meleah, Menan, Mattithiah, Nathan, David, Jesse,
Obed, Boaz, Salah, Nahshon, Aminadab, Arni, Hezron, Perez, Judah, Jacob,
Isaac, Abraham, Terah, Nahor, Serug, Reu, Peleg, Eber, Shelah, Kenan,
Arpachshad, Shem, Noah, Lamech, Methuselah, Enoch, Jared, Mahalalel,
Kenan, Enosh, Seth, son of Adam, and Adam, son of God.
  On returning from the Jordan, full of the Holy Spirit, Jesus was led
by the power of the Spirit through the wilderness for forty days,
tempted by the devil.
     All that time he ate nothing; and, when it was over, he became
hungry. So the devil said to him, 'If you are God's Son, tell this stone
to become a loaf of bread.' And Jesus answered him, 'Scripture says --
"It is not on bread alone that a person is to live."'
     And the devil led Jesus up, and showing him in a single moment all
the kingdoms of the earth, said to him, 'I will give you all this power,
and the splendour of them; for it has been given into my hands and I
give it to whom I wish. If you worship me, it will all be yours.' And
Jesus answered him, 'Scripture says -- "You should worship the Lord your
God, and worship him only."'
     The devil next led him into Jerusalem, and, placing him on the
parapet of the Temple, said, 'If you are God's Son throw yourself down
from here, for scripture says -- "He will give his angels commands about
you, to guard you safely," And "On their hands they will lift you up,
otherwise you might strike your foot against a stone."' But Jesus
answered him, 'It is said -- "You must not tempt the Lord your God."'
     When he had tried every kind of temptation, the devil left Jesus,
until another opportunity.

*The Work in Galilee*

     Moved by the power of the Spirit, Jesus returned to Galilee.
Reports about him spread through all that region; and he began to teach
in their synagogues, and was honoured by everyone.

     Coming to Nazareth, where he had been brought up, Jesus, as was his
custom, went on the Sabbath into the synagogue, and stood up to read the
scriptures. He was given the book of the prophet Isaiah; and Jesus
opened the book and found the place where it says --

         "The Spirit of the Lord is on me,
     for he has consecrated me to bring good news to the poor,
     he has sent me to proclaim release to captives and restoration of
sight to the blind,
         to set the oppressed at liberty,
             to proclaim the year of the Lord's favour."
 Then, closing the book and returning it to the attendant, he sat down.
The eyes of all in the synagogue were fixed on him, and Jesus began,
     'This very day this passage has been fulfilled in your hearing.'
     All who were present spoke well of him, and were astonished at the
beautiful words that fell from his lips. 'Isn't this Joseph's son?' they
asked. 'Doubtless,' said Jesus, 'you will remind me of the saying --
"Doctor, cure yourself;" and you will say "Do here in your own country
all that we have heard that has been done at Capernaum." I tell you,' he
continued, 'that no prophet is acceptable in his own country. There
were, doubtless, many widows in Israel in Elijah's days, when the
heavens were closed for three years and six months, and a severe famine
prevailed throughout the country; and yet it was not to one of them that
Elijah was sent, but to a widow at Zarephath in Sidonia. And there were
many lepers in Israel in the time of the prophet Elisha, yet it was not
one of them who was made clean, but Naaman the Syrian.' All the people
in the synagogue, as they listened to this, became enraged. Starting up,
they drove Jesus out of the town, and led him to the brow of the hill on
which their town stood, intending to hurl him down. But he passed
through the middle of the crowd and went on his way.

     Then Jesus went down to Capernaum, a city in Galilee. On the
Sabbath he taught the people. They were amazed at his teaching, because
his words were spoken with authority. In the synagogue there was a man
with the spirit of a foul demon in him, who called out loudly, 'Stop!
What do you want with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy
us? I know who you are -- the Holy One of God!' But Jesus rebuked the
demon. 'Be silent! Come out from him,' he said. The demon flung the man
down in the middle of the people, and then came out from him, without
causing him further harm. And they were all lost in amazement, and kept
saying to one another, 'What words are these? For he gives his commands
to the foul spirits with a marvellous authority, and they come out.' And
rumours about Jesus traveled through every place in the region.
     On leaving the synagogue, Jesus went into Simon's house. Now
Simon's mother-in-law was suffering from a severe attack of fever, and
they asked Jesus to cure her. Bending over her, he rebuked the fever;
the fever left her, and she immediately got up and began to take care of
them. At sunset, all who had friends suffering from various diseases
took them to Jesus; and he placed his hands on everyone of them and
cured them. And even demons came out from many people, screaming "You
are the Son of God." Jesus rebuked them, and would not allow them to
speak, because they knew that he was the Christ.
     At daybreak, Jesus went out and walked to a lonely spot. But crowds
of people began to look for him; and they came to where he was and tried
to detain him and prevent his leaving them. Jesus, however, said to
them, 'I must take the good news of the kingdom of God to the other
towns too, for that was why I was sent.' And he continued to make his
proclamation in the synagogues of Judea.

     Once, when the people were pressing round Jesus as they listened to
God's message, he happened to be standing by the shore of the Lake of
Gennesaret, and saw two boats close to the shore. The fishermen had gone
away from them and were washing the nets. So, getting into one of the
boats, which belonged to Simon, Jesus asked him to push off a little way
from the shore, and then sat down and taught the people from the boat.
When he had finished speaking, he said to Simon, 'Push off into deep
water, and throw out your nets for a haul.'
     'We have been hard at work all night, Sir,' answered Simon, 'and
have not caught anything, but, at your bidding, I will throw out the
nets.' They did so, and enclosed such a great shoal of fish that their
nets began to break. So they signalled to their partners in the other
boat to come and help them; and they came and filled both the boats so
full of fish that they were almost sinking. When Simon Peter saw this,
he threw himself down at Jesus' knees, exclaiming, 'Master, leave me,
for I am a sinful man!' For he and all who were with him were lost in
amazement at the haul of fish which they had made; and so, too, were
James and John, Zebedee's sons, who were Simon's partners. 'Do not be
afraid,' Jesus said to Simon, 'from today you will catch people.' And,
when they had brought their boats to shore, they left everything, and
followed him.

     On one occasion Jesus was staying in a town, when he saw a man who
was covered with leprosy. When the leper saw Jesus, he threw himself on
his face and implored his help, 'Master, if only you are willing, you
are able to make me clean.' Stretching out his hand, Jesus touched him,
saying as he did so, 'I am willing; become clean.'
     Instantly the leprosy left the man; and then Jesus impressed on him
that he was not to say a word to anyone, 'but,' he added, 'set out and
show yourself to the priest, and make the offerings for your cleansing,
in the manner directed by Moses, as evidence of your cure.' However, the
story about Jesus spread all the more, and great crowds came together to
listen to him, and to be cured of their illnesses; but Jesus used to
withdraw to lonely places and pray.
     On one of those days, when Jesus was teaching, some Pharisees and
Doctors of the Law were sitting near by. (They had come from all the
villages in Galilee and Judea, and from Jerusalem; and the power of the
Lord was on Jesus, so that he could work cures.) And there some men
brought on a bed a man who was paralysed. They tried to get him in and
lay him before Jesus; but, finding no way of getting him in owing to the
crowd, they went up on the roof and lowered him through the tiles, with
his pallet, into the middle of the people and in front of Jesus. When he
saw their faith, Jesus said, 'Friend, your sins have been forgiven you.'
The teachers of the Law and the Pharisees began debating about this.
'Who is this man who speaks so blasphemously?' they asked. 'Who can
forgive sins except God?'
     When Jesus became aware of the way in which they were debating, he
turned to them and exclaimed, 'What are you debating with yourselves?
Which is the easier? -- to say "Your sins have been forgiven you"? Or to
say "Get up, and walk"? But so that you may know that the Son of Man has
power on earth to forgive sins' -- he spoke to the paralysed man -- 'To
you I say, Get up, and take up your pallet, and go to your home.'
Instantly the man stood up before their eyes, took up what he had been
lying on, and went to his home, praising God. The people, one and all,
were lost in amazement, and praised God; and in great awe they said, 'We
have seen marvellous things today!'

     After this, Jesus went out; and he noticed a tax-gatherer, named
Levi, sitting in the tax office, and said to him, 'Follow me.' Levi left
everything and got up and followed him. And Levi gave a great banquet at
his house, in honour of Jesus; and a large number of tax collectors and
others were having dinner with them.
     The Pharisees and the teachers of the Law belonging to their party
complained of this to the disciples of Jesus. In answer Jesus said, 'It
is not those who are well who need a doctor, but those who are ill. I
have not come to call the religious, but the outcast, to repent.'
     'John's disciples,' they said to Jesus, 'Often fast and say
prayers, and so do the disciples of the Pharisees, while yours are
eating and drinking!'
     But Jesus answered them, 'Can you make the groom's friends fast
while the groom is with them? But the days will come -- a time when the
groom will be taken away from them; and they will fast then, when those
days come.' Then, as an illustration, Jesus said to them, 'No one ever
tears a piece from a new garment and puts it on an old one; for, if they
do, they will not only tear the new garment, but the piece from the new
one will not match the old. And no one puts new wine into old wine-
skins; for, if they do, the new wine will burst the skins, and the wine
itself will run out, and the skins be lost. But new wine must be put
into fresh skins. No one after drinking old wine wishes for new. "No,"
they say, "the old is excellent."'
     One Sabbath Jesus was walking through cornfields, and his disciples
were picking the ears of wheat, and rubbing them in their hands, and
eating them. 'Why are you doing what it is not allowable to do on the
Sabbath?' asked some of the Pharisees. Jesus' answer was, 'Haven't you
read even of what David did, when he was hungry, he and his companions
-- That he went into the house of God, and took the consecrated bread
and ate it, and gave some to his companions, though only the priests are
allowed to eat it?' Then Jesus added, 'The Son of Man is lord even of
the Sabbath.'
     On another Sabbath Jesus went into the synagogue and taught; and
there was a man there whose right hand was withered. The teachers of the
Law and the Pharisees watched Jesus closely, to see if he would work
cures on the Sabbath, so that they might find a charge to bring against
him. Jesus, however, knew what was in their minds, and said to the man
whose hand was withered, 'Stand up and come out into the middle.' The
man stood up, and Jesus said to them, 'I ask you, is it allowable to do
good on the Sabbath -- or harm? To save a life, or let it perish?' Then,
looking round at them all, he said to the man, 'Stretch out your hand.'
The man did so; and his hand had become sound. But the teachers of the
Law and the Pharisees were mad with rage, and consulted together what
they could do to Jesus.
     Now about that time, Jesus went out, up the hill, to pray, and
spent the whole night in prayer to God. When day came, he summoned his
disciples, and chose twelve of them, whom he also named "apostles." They
were Simon (whom Jesus also named Peter), and his brother Andrew, James,
John, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James son of Alphaeus, Simon
known as the Zealot, Judas son of James, and Judas Iscariot, who proved
a traitor. Afterwards Jesus came down the hill with them and took his
stand on a level place. With him were a large crowd of his disciples,
and great numbers of people from the whole of Judea, Jerusalem, and the
coast district of Tyre and Sidon, who had come to hear him and to be
restored to health. Those, too, who were troubled with foul spirits were
cured; and everyone in the crowd was trying to touch him, because a
power went out from him which restored them all.
     Then, raising his eyes and looking at his disciples, Jesus said:

     'Blessed are you who are poor, for yours is the kingdom of God.
     Blessed are you who hunger now, for you will be satisfied.
     Blessed are you who weep now, for you will laugh.
     Blessed are you when people hate you,
         and when they expel you from among them,
         and insult you,
         and reject your name as an evil thing --
     because of the Son of Man.


     Then indeed you may be glad and dance for joy, for be sure that
your reward in heaven will be great; for that is what their ancestors
did to the prophets. But


     alas for you who are rich,
         for you have had your comforts in full.
     Alas for you who are sated now,
         for you will hunger.
     Alas for you who laugh now,
         for you will mourn and weep.
     Alas for you when everyone speaks well of you;
         for this is what their ancestors did to the false prophets.


     But to you who hear I say -- love your enemies, show kindness to
those who hate you, bless those who curse you, pray for those who insult
you. When someone gives one of you a blow on the cheek, offer the other
cheek as well; and, when anyone takes away your cloak, do not keep back
your coat either. Give to everyone who asks of you; and, when anyone
takes away what is yours, do not demand its return. Do to others as you
wish them to do to you.


     If you love only those who love you, what thanks will be due to
you? Why, even the outcast love those who love them! For, if you show
kindness only to those who show kindness to you, what thanks will be due
to you? Even the outcast do that! If you lend only to those from whom
you expect to get something, what thanks will be due to you? Even the
outcast lend to the outcast in the hope of getting as much in return!
But love your enemies, and show them kindness, and lend to them, never
despairing. Then your reward will be great, and you will be sons of the
Most High, for he is kind to the thankless and the bad.


     Learn to be merciful -- even as your Father is merciful. Do not
judge, and you will not be judged; do not condemn, and you will not be
condemned. Forgive, and you will be forgiven. Give, and others will give
to you. A generous measure, pressed and shaken down, and running over,
will they pour into your lap; for the standard you use will be the
standard used for you.'
 Then, speaking in parables, Jesus said, 'Can one blind person guide
another? Will they not both fall into a ditch? A student is not above
their teacher; yet every finished student will be like their teacher.
And why do you look at the speck of sawdust in someone's eye, while you
pay no attention at all to the plank of wood in your own? How can you
say to your friend "Friend, let me take out the speck in your eye,"
while you yourself do not see the plank in your own? Hypocrite! Take out
the plank from your own eye first, and then you will see clearly how to
take out the speck in your friend's. There is no such thing as a good
tree bearing worthless fruit, or, on the other hand, a worthless tree
bearing good fruit. For every tree is known by its own fruit. People do
not gather figs off thorn bushes, nor pick a bunch of grapes off a
bramble. A good person, from the good stores of their heart, brings out
what is good; while a bad person, from their bad stores, brings out what
is bad. For what fills someone's heart will rise to their lips. Why do
you call me "Master! Master!" and yet fail to do what I tell you?
Everyone who comes to me and listens to my teaching and acts on it -- I
will show you to whom they may be compared. They may be compared to a
person building a house, who dug, and went deep, and laid the foundation
on the rock. Then, when a flood came, the river swept down on that
house, but had no power to shake it, because it had been built well. But
those who have listened and not acted on what they have heard may be
compared to a person who built a house on the ground without any
foundation. The river swept down on it, and the house immediately
collapsed; and great was the crash that followed.'
     When Jesus had finished all he had to say to the people, he entered
Capernaum.
     A centurion in the Roman army had a slave whom he valued, and who
was seriously ill -- almost at the point of death. And, hearing about
Jesus, he sent some Jewish elders to him, with the request that he would
come and save his slave's life. When they found Jesus, they earnestly
implored him to help. 'He deserves this favour from you.' they said, 'He
is devoted to our people, and even built our synagogue for us.' So Jesus
went with them. But, when he was no great distance from the house, the
centurion sent some friends with the message -- 'Do not trouble
yourself, Sir; for I am unworthy to receive you under my roof. That was
why I did not even venture to come to you myself; but speak, and let my
manservant be cured. For I myself am a man under the orders of others,
with soldiers under me; and if I say to one of them "Go," he goes, and
to another "Come," he comes, and to my slave "Do this," he does it.'
Jesus was surprised to hear these words from him; and, turning to the
crowd which was following him, he said, 'I tell you, nowhere in Israel
have I met with such faith as this!' And, when the messengers returned
to the house, they found the slave recovered.
     Shortly after, Jesus went to a town called Nain, his disciples and
a great crowd going with him. Just as he approached the gate of the
town, there was a dead man being carried out for burial -- an only son,
and his mother was a widow. A large number of the people of the town
were with her. When he saw her, the Master was moved with compassion for
her, and he said to her, 'Do not weep.' Then he went up and touched the
bier, and the bearers stopped; and Jesus said, 'Young man, I am speaking
to you -- Rise!' The dead man sat up and began to talk, and Jesus
restored him to his mother. Everyone was awe-struck and began praising
God. 'A great prophet has arisen among us,' they said. 'God has visited
his people.'
     And this story about Jesus spread all through Judea, and in the
neighbouring countries as well.

     All these events were reported to John by his disciples. So he
summoned two of them, and sent them to the Master to ask -- 'Are you
"the coming one," or are we to look for someone else?'
     When these men found Jesus, they said, 'John the Baptist has sent
us to you to ask -- Are you "the coming one," or are we to look for
somebody else?' At that very time Jesus had cured many people of
diseases, afflictions, and wicked spirits, and had given many blind
people their sight. So his answer to the question was, 'Go and report to
John what you have witnessed and heard -- the blind recover their sight,
the lame walk, the lepers are made clean, and the deaf hear, the dead
are raised to life, the good news is told to the poor. And blessed is
the person who finds no hindrance in me.'
     When John's messengers had left, Jesus, speaking to the crowds,
began to say with reference to John, 'What did you go out into the
wilderness to look at? A reed waving in the wind? If not, what did you
go out to see? A man dressed in rich clothing? Why, those who are
accustomed to fine clothes and luxury live in royal palaces. What then
did you go to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and far more than a
prophet. This is the man of whom scripture says --

     "I am sending my messenger ahead of you,
         and he will prepare your way before you."
 There is, I tell you, no one born of a woman who is greater than John;
and yet the least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.'
     (All the people, when they heard this, and even the tax collectors,
having accepted John's baptism, acknowledged the justice of God. But the
Pharisees and the students of the Law, having rejected John's baptism,
frustrated God's purpose in regard to them.)
     'To what then,' Jesus continued, 'should I compare the people of
the present generation? What are they like? They are like some little
children who are sitting in the marketplace and calling out to one
another -- "We have played the flute for you, but you have not danced;
We have wailed, but you have not wept!" For now that John the Baptist
has come, not eating bread or drinking wine, you are saying "He has a
demon in him"; and now that the Son of Man has come, eating and
drinking, you are saying "Here is a glutton and a wine-drinker, a friend
of tax collectors and outcasts." And yet wisdom is vindicated by all her
children.'
     One of the Pharisees asked Jesus to dine with him, so Jesus went to
his house and took his place at the table. Just then a woman, who was an
outcast in the town, having heard that Jesus was eating in the
Pharisee's house, brought an alabaster jar of perfume, and placed
herself behind Jesus, near his feet, weeping. Then she began to make his
feet wet with her tears, and she dried them with the hair of her head,
repeatedly kissing his feet and anointing them with the perfume.
     When the Pharisee who had invited Jesus saw this, he said to
himself, 'Had this man been "the prophet," he would have known who, and
what sort of woman, this is who is touching him, and that she is an
outcast.' But, addressing him, Jesus said, 'Simon, I have something to
say to you.'
     'Pray do so, teacher,' Simon answered; and Jesus began, 'There were
two people who were in debt to a moneylender; one owed five hundred
silver coins, and the other fifty. As they were unable to pay, he
forgave them both. Which of them, do you think, will love him the more?'
     'I suppose,' answered Simon, 'it will be the man to whom he forgave
the greater debt.'
     'You are right,' said Jesus, and then, turning to the woman, he
said to Simon, 'Do you see this woman? I came into your house -- you
gave me no water for my feet, but she has made my feet wet with her
tears and dried them with her hair. You did not give me one kiss, but
she, from the moment I came in, has not ceased to kiss my feet. You did
not anoint even my head with oil, but she has anointed my feet with
perfume. So I tell you, her great love shows that her sins, many as they
are, have been pardoned. One who is pardoned little loves little.' Then
he said to the woman, 'Your sins have been pardoned.' The other guests
began to say to one another, 'Who is this man who even pardons sins?'
But Jesus said to the woman, 'Your faith has delivered you; go, and
peace be with you.'

     Shortly afterwards, Jesus went on a journey through the towns and
villages, proclaiming the good news of the kingdom of God. With him went
the Twelve, as well as some women who had been cured of wicked spirits
and of infirmities. They were Mary, known as Mary of Magdala (from whom
seven demons had been expelled), and Joanna (the wife of Herod's
steward, Chuza), and Susannah, and many others -- all of whom provided
for Jesus and his apostles out of their own resources.
     Once, when a great crowd was collecting, and, when the people of
town after town were flocking to Jesus, he spoke to them in the form of
a parable, 'The sower went out to sow his seed; and, as he was sowing,
some of the seed fell along the path and was trodden on; and the wild
birds ate it up. Other seed fell on rock, and, as soon as it began to
grow, because it had no moisture, it withered away. Other seed fell in
the middle of brambles, but the brambles grew up with it and choked it
entirely. Other seed fell into rich soil, and grew, and gave a
hundredfold return.' After saying this, Jesus cried aloud, 'Let those
who have ears to hear with hear.'
     His disciples asked Jesus the meaning of this parable. 'To you,' he
said, 'the knowledge of the hidden truths of the kingdom of God has been
imparted, but to others in parables only, so that though they have eyes
they may not see, and though they have ears, they may not understand.
This is the parable -- The seed is God's message. By the seed which fell
along the path are meant those who hear the message; but then comes the
devil and carries away the message from their minds, to prevent their
believing it and being saved. By the seed which fell on the rock are
meant those who, as soon as they hear the message, welcome it joyfully;
but they have no root, and believe it only for a time, and, when the
time of temptation comes, they draw back. By that which fell among the
brambles are meant those who hear the message, but who, as they go on
their way, are completely choked by this world's cares and wealth and
pleasures, and bring nothing to perfection. But by that in the good
ground are meant those who, having heard the message, keep it in the
good, rich soil of their hearts, and patiently yield a return.
     'No one sets light to a lamp and then covers it with a bowl or puts
it underneath a couch, but they put it on a lamp-stand, so that anyone
who comes in may see the light. Nothing is hidden which will not be
brought into the light of day, not ever kept hidden which will not some
day become known and come into the light of day. Take care, then, how
you listen. For, to all those who have, more will be given; while, from
all those who have nothing, even what they seem to have will be taken
away.'
     Presently Jesus' mother and brothers came where he was, but they
were not able to join him because of the crowd. So word was brought to
him -- "Your mother and your brothers are standing outside, wanting to
see you." His reply, spoken to them all, was, 'My mother and my brothers
are those who listen to God's teaching and do what it says.'
     One day about that time, Jesus got into a boat with his disciples
and said to them, 'Let us go across the lake.' So they put off. While
they were sailing, Jesus fell asleep. A squall swept down on the lake,
and their boat was filling and they were in danger. So the disciples
came and roused him. 'Sir, Sir,' they cried, 'we are lost!' Jesus rose
and rebuked the wind and the rushing waves, and they fell, and a calm
followed. 'Where is your faith?' he exclaimed. But in great awe and
amazement they said to one another, 'Who can this be, who commands even
the winds and the waves, and they obey him?'
     They reached the region of the Gerasenes, which is on the opposite
side to Galilee, and, on getting ashore, Jesus met a man, who had demons
in him, coming out of the town. For a long time this man had worn no
clothing, and he had not lived in a house, but in the tombs. Catching
sight of Jesus, he shrieked out and threw himself down before him, and
in a loud voice exclaimed, 'What do you want with me, Jesus, Son of the
Most High God? I beg you not to torment me.' For Jesus was commanding
the foul spirit to come out of the man. On many occasions it had seized
him, and, even when secured with chains and fetters, and watched, he
would break through anything that bound him, and be driven by the demon
into the wilds.
     'What is your name?' Jesus asked.
     'Legion,' he answered (for many demons had taken possession of
him); and the demons begged Jesus not to order them away into the
bottomless pit. There was a herd of many pigs close by feeding on the
hill-side; and the demons begged Jesus to give them leave to enter into
them. Jesus gave them leave. They came out from the man and took
possession of the pigs; and the herd rushed down the steep slope into
the lake and were drowned. When the men who tended them saw what had
happened, they ran away, and carried the news to the town, and to the
country round. The people went out to see what had happened, and, when
they came to Jesus, they found the man from whom the demons had gone
out, sitting, clothed and in his right mind, at Jesus' feet; and they
were awe-struck. Those who had seen it told them how the possessed man
had been delivered. Then all the people in the region of the Gerasenes
asked Jesus to leave them, for they were terrified. Jesus got into a
boat and returned. The man from whom the demons had gone out begged
Jesus to let him be with him; but Jesus sent him away. 'Go back to your
home,' he said, 'and relate the story of all that God has done for you.'
So the man went through the whole town and proclaimed, as he went, all
that Jesus had done for him.

     On his return, Jesus was welcomed by the people; for everyone was
looking out for him. And a man named Jairus, who was a synagogue leader,
came to Jesus, and threw himself at Jesus' feet, with entreaties that he
would come to his house, because his only daughter, who was about twelve
years old, was dying. As Jesus was going, the people were pressing
closely round him. And a woman, who had suffered from haemorrhage for
twelve years, and whom no one could cure, came up behind and touched the
tassel of his cloak. Instantly the haemorrhage ceased.
     'Who touched me?' Jesus asked; and, while everyone was denying
having done so, Peter exclaimed, 'Why, Sir, the people are crowding
round you and pressing against you!'
     'Somebody touched me,' said Jesus, 'for I felt that power had gone
out from me.' Then the woman, when she saw that she was discovered, came
forward trembling, and threw herself down before him; and, in the
presence of all the people, she told him her reason for touching him,
and that she had been cured instantly.
     'Daughter,' he said, 'your faith has delivered you. Go, and peace
be with you.'
     Before he had finished speaking, someone came from the house of the
synagogue leader and said, 'Your daughter is dead! Do not trouble the
teacher further.' But Jesus, hearing this, spoke to the leader, 'Do not
be afraid; only have faith, and she will yet be delivered.' When he
reached the house, he did not allow anyone to go in with him, except
Peter, John, and James, and the child's father and mother. And everyone
was weeping and mourning for her.
     'Do not weep,' Jesus said, 'she is not dead; she is asleep.' They
began to laugh at him, for they knew that she was dead. But, taking her
by the hand, Jesus said in a loud voice, 'Child, rise!' The child's
spirit returned to her, and she instantly stood up; and Jesus ordered
them to give her something to eat. Her parents were amazed, but Jesus
impressed on them that they were not to tell anyone what had happened.

     Jesus called the Twelve together, and gave them power and authority
over all demons, as well as to cure diseases. He sent them out as his
messengers, to proclaim the kingdom of God, and to work cures. 'Do not,'
he said to them, 'take anything for your journey; not even a staff, or a
bag, or bread, or any silver, or a change of clothes with you. Whatever
house you go to stay in, remain there, and leave from that place. If
people do not welcome you, as you leave that town, shake even the dust
off your feet, as a protest against them.' Then they set out and went
from village to village, telling the good news and curing people
everywhere.
     Herod the ruler heard of all that was happening, and was perplexed,
because it was said by some that John must be risen from the dead. Some
again said that Elijah had appeared, and others that one of the old
prophets had risen again. But Herod himself said, 'John I beheaded; but
who is this of whom I hear such things?' And he endeavoured to see him.
     When the apostles returned, they related to Jesus all that they had
done. Then Jesus went privately to a town called Bethsaida, taking the
apostles with him. But the people recognised him and followed him in
crowds; and Jesus welcomed them and spoke to them about the kingdom of
God, while he cured those who were in need of help. The day was drawing
to a close, when the twelve came up to him, and said, 'Send the crowd
away, so that they may make their way to the villages and farms round
about, and find themselves lodgings and provisions, for we are in a
lonely spot here.' But Jesus said, 'It is for you to give them something
to eat.'
     'We have not more than five loaves and two fish,' they answered.
'Unless indeed we are to go and buy food for all these people.' (For the
men among them were about five thousand.) 'Get them seated in
companies,' was his reply, 'about fifty in each.' This they did, and got
all the people seated. Taking the five loaves and the two fish, Jesus
looked up to heaven and said the blessing over them. Then he broke them
in pieces, and gave them to his disciples to set before the people.
Everyone had sufficient to eat, and what was left of the broken pieces
was picked up -- twelve baskets.
     Afterwards, when Jesus was alone, praying, his disciples joined
him, and he asked them this question -- 'Who do the people say that I
am?'
     'John the Baptist,' was their answer. 'Others, however, say that
you are Elijah, while others say that one of the old prophets has risen
again.'
     'But you,' he went on, 'who do you say that I am?' And to this
Peter answered, 'The Christ of God.'
     Jesus, however, strictly charged them not to say this to anyone; he
told them that the Son of Man must undergo much suffering, and be
rejected by the elders, and chief priests, and teachers of the Law, and
be put to death, and rise on the third day. And to all present he said,
'If any one wishes to walk in my steps, they must renounce self, and
take up their cross daily, and follow me. For whoever wishes to save
their life will lose it, and whoever, for my sake, loses his life --
that person will save it. What good does it do someone if, when they has
gained the whole world, they has lost or forfeited themselves? Whoever
is ashamed of me and of my teaching, the Son of Man will be ashamed of
them, when he comes in his glory and the glory of the father and of the
holy angels. Indeed, I tell you, some who are standing before me will
not know death, until they have seen the kingdom of God.'
     About eight days after speaking these words, Jesus went up the
mountain to pray, taking with him Peter, John, and James. As he was
praying, the aspect of his face was changed, and his clothing became a
dazzling white. And all at once two men were talking with Jesus; they
were Moses and Elijah, who appeared in a glorified state, and spoke of
his departure, which was destined to take place at Jerusalem. Peter and
his companions had been overpowered by sleep but, suddenly becoming wide
awake, they saw Jesus glorified and the two men who were standing beside
him.
     And, as Moses and Elijah were passing away from Jesus, Peter
exclaimed, 'Sir, it is good to be here; let us make three tents, one for
you, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah.' He did not know what he was
saying; and, while he was speaking, a cloud came down and enveloped
them; and they were afraid, as they passed into the cloud; and from the
cloud came a voice which said -- 'This is my Son, the Chosen One; him
you must hear.' And, as the voice ceased, Jesus was found alone. The
apostles kept silence, and told no one about any of the things that they
had seen.

     The next day, when they had come down from the mountain, a great
crowd met Jesus. And just then a man in the crowd shouted out, 'Teacher,
I entreat you to look at my son, for he is my only child; all at once a
spirit will seize him, suddenly shriek out, and throw him into
convulsions until he foams, and will leave him only when he is utterly
exhausted. I entreated your disciples to drive the spirit out, but they
could not.'
     'Faithless and perverse generation!' Jesus exclaimed, 'How long
must I be with you and have patience with you? Lead your son here.'
While the boy was coming up to Jesus, the demon dashed him down and
threw him into convulsions. But Jesus rebuked the foul spirit, and cured
the boy, and gave him back to his father. And all present were struck
with awe at the majesty of God.
    In the midst of the general astonishment at all that Jesus was
doing, he said to his disciples, 'Listen carefully to my words. For the
Son of Man is destined to be betrayed into the hands of his fellow men.'
But the disciples did not understand the meaning of this; it had been
concealed from them so that they did not see it, and they were afraid to
question him as to what he meant.
     A discussion arose among the disciples as to which of them was the
greatest; and Jesus, knowing of the discussion that was occupying their
thoughts, took hold of a little child, and placed it beside him, and
then said to them, 'Anyone who, for the sake of my name, welcomes even
this little child is welcoming me; and anyone who welcomes me is
welcoming him who sent me as his messenger. For whoever is least among
you all -- that person is great.'
     John said, 'Sir, we saw a man driving out demons by using your
name, and we tried to prevent him, because he does not follow you with
us.'
     'None of you must prevent him,' Jesus said to John, 'whoever is not
against you is for you.'

*The Journey to Jerusalem*

     As the days before his being taken up to heaven were growing few,
Jesus set his face resolutely in the direction of Jerusalem; and he sent
on messengers in advance. On their way, they went into a Samaritan
village to make preparations for him, but the people there did not
welcome him, because his face was set in the direction of Jerusalem.
When James and John saw this, they said, 'Master, do you wish us to call
for fire to come down from the heavens and consume them?' But Jesus
turned and rebuked them. And they made their way to another village.
     And, while they were on their way, a man said to Jesus, 'I will
follow you wherever you go.'
     'Foxes have holes,' he replied, 'and wild birds their nests, but
the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head.' To another man Jesus said,
'Follow me.'
     'Let me first go and bury my father,' said the man. But Jesus said,
'Leave the dead to bury their dead; but go yourself and carry far and
wide the news of the kingdom of God.'
     'Master,' said another, 'I will follow you; but first let me say
goodbye to my family.' But Jesus answered, 'No one who looks back, after
putting their hand to the plough, is fitted for the kingdom of God.'

     After this, the Master appointed seventy-two other disciples, and
sent them on as his messengers, two and two, in advance, to every town
and place that he was himself intending to visit.
     'The harvest,' he said, 'is abundant, but the labourers are few.
Therefore pray to the owner of the harvest to send labourers to gather
in his harvest. Now, go. Remember, I am sending you out as my messengers
like lambs among wolves. Do not take a purse with you, or a bag, or
sandals; and do not stop to greet anyone on your journey. Whatever house
you go to stay at, begin by praying for a blessing on it. Then, if
anyone there is deserving of a blessing, your blessing will rest on him;
but if not, it will come back on yourselves. Remain at that same house,
and eat and drink whatever they offer you; for the worker is worth their
wages. Do not keep changing from one house to another. Whatever town you
visit, if the people welcome you, eat what is set before you; cure the
sick there, and tell people that the kingdom of God is close at hand.
But, whatever town you go to visit, if the people do not welcome you, go
out into its streets and say "We wipe off the dust of your town which
has clung to Our feet; still, be assured that the kingdom of God is
close at Hand." I tell you that the doom of Sodom will be more bearable
on that day than the doom of that town. Alas for you, Chorazin! Alas for
you, Bethsaida! For, if the miracles which have been done in you had
been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have sat in sackcloth and ashes
and repented long ago. Yet the doom of Tyre and Sidon will be more
bearable at the judgment than yours. And you, Capernaum! Will you exalt
yourself to heaven? You will be flung down to Hades. Anyone who listens
to you is listening to me, and anyone who rejects you is rejecting me;
while the person who rejects me is rejecting him who sent me as his
messenger.'
     When the seventy-two returned, they exclaimed joyfully, 'Master,
even the demons submit to us when we use your name.' And Jesus replied,
'I have had visions of Satan, fallen, like lightning from the heavens.
Remember, I have given you the power to trample on snakes and scorpions,
and to meet all the strength of the Enemy. Nothing will ever harm you in
any way. Yet do not rejoice in the fact that the spirits submit to you,
but rejoice that your names have been enrolled in heaven.'
     At that same time, moved to exultation by the Holy Spirit, Jesus
said:

     'I thank you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that, though you
have hidden these things from the wise and learned, you have revealed
them to the childlike! Yes, Father, I thank you that this has seemed
good to you.


     Everything has been committed to me by my Father; nor does anyone
know who the Son is, except the Father, or who the Father is, except the
Son and those to whom the Son may choose to reveal him.'
 Then, turning to his disciples, Jesus said to them alone, 'Blessed are
the eyes that see what you are seeing; for, I tell you, many prophets
and kings wished for the sight of the things which you are seeing, yet
never heard them.'
     Just then a student of the Law came forward to test Jesus further.
'Teacher,' he said, 'what must I do if I am to gain eternal life?'
     'What is said in the Law?' answered Jesus. 'What do you read
there?' His reply was --

     'You must love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all
your soul, and with all your strength, and with all your mind; and your
neighbour as you love yourself.'
 'You have answered right,' said Jesus, 'Do that, and you will live.'
But the man, wanting to justify himself, said to Jesus, 'And who is my
neighbour?'
     To which Jesus replied, 'A man was once going down from Jerusalem
to Jericho when he fell into the hands of robbers, who stripped him of
everything, and beat him, and went away leaving him half dead. As it
chanced, a priest was going down by that road. He saw the man, but
passed by on the opposite side. A Levite, too, did the same; he came up
to the spot, but, when he saw the man, passed by on the opposite side.
But a Samaritan, traveling that way, came upon the man, and, when he saw
him, he was moved with compassion. He went to him and bound up his
wounds, dressing them with oil and wine, and then put him on his own
mule, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him. The next day he
took out two silver coins and gave them to the innkeeper. "Take care of
him," he said, "and whatever more you may spend I will myself repay you
on my way back." Now which, do you think, of these three men,' asked
Jesus, 'proved himself a neighbour to the man who fell into the robbers'
hands?'
     'The one that took pity on him,' was the answer; at which Jesus
said, 'Go and do the same yourself.'

     As they continued their journey, Jesus came to a village, where a
woman named Martha welcomed him to her house. She had a sister called
Mary, who seated herself at the Master's feet, and listened to his
teaching; but Martha was distracted by the many preparations that she
was making. So she went up to Jesus and said, 'Master, do you approve of
my sister's leaving me to make preparations alone? Tell her to help me.'
     'Martha, Martha,' replied the Master, 'you are anxious and trouble
yourself about many things; but only a few are necessary, or rather one.
Mary has chosen the good part, and it will not be taken away from her.'
     One day Jesus was at a certain place praying, and, when he had
finished, one of his disciples said to him, 'Master, teach us to pray,
as John taught his disciples.'
     'When you pray,' Jesus answered, 'say --

     "Father,
         may your name be held holy,
         your kingdom come.
     Give us each day the bread that we will need;
     and forgive us our sins,
     for we ourselves forgive everyone who wrongs us;
     and take us not into temptation."'
 Jesus also said to them, 'Suppose that one of you who has a friend were
to go to him in the middle of the night and say "Friend, lend me three
loaves, for a friend of mine has arrived at my house after a journey,
and I have nothing to offer him;" And suppose that the other should
answer from inside "Do not trouble me; the door is already fastened, and
my children and I are in bed; I cannot get up and give you anything"; I
tell you that, even though he will not get up and give him anything
because he is a friend, yet because of his persistence he will rouse
himself and give him what he wants.
     'And so I say to you -- Ask, and your prayer will be granted,
search, and you will find; knock, and the door will be opened to you.
For the person who asks receives, everyone who searches finds, and to
the person who knocks the door will be opened. What father among you, if
his son asks him for a fish, will give him a snake instead, or, if he
asks for an egg, will give him a scorpion? If you, then, naturally
wicked though you are, know how to give good gifts to your children, how
much more will the Father in heaven give the Holy Spirit to those who
ask him!'

     Once Jesus was driving out a mute demon, and, when the demon had
gone out, the mute man spoke. The people were amazed at this; but some
of them said, 'He drives out demons by the help of Beelzebul, the chief
of the demons'; while others, to test him, asked him for some sign from
the heavens. Jesus himself, however, was aware of what they were
thinking, and said to them, 'Any kingdom wholly divided against itself
becomes a desolation; and a divided house falls. So, too, if Satan is
wholly divided against himself, how can his kingdom last? Yet you say
that I drive out demons by the help of Beelzebul. But, if it is by
Beelzebul's help that I drive out demons, by whose help is it that your
own sons drive them out? Therefore they will themselves be your judges.
But, if it is by the hand of God that I drive out demons, then the
kingdom of God must already be upon you. When a strong man is keeping
guard, fully armed, over his own mansion, his property is in safety;
but, when one still stronger has attacked and overpowered him, he takes
away all the weapons on which the other had relied, and divides his
spoil. Whoever is not with me is against me, and the person who does not
help me to gather is scattering. No sooner does a foul spirit leave
someone, than it passes through places where there is no water, in
search of rest; and finding none, it says "I will go back to the home
which I left"; but, on coming there, it finds it unoccupied, swept, and
put in order. Then it goes and brings with it seven other spirits more
wicked than itself, and they go in, and make their home there; and the
last state of that person proves to be worse than the first.' As Jesus
was saying this, a woman in the crowd, raising her voice, exclaimed,
'Happy was the mother who bore you and nursed you!' But Jesus replied,
'Rather, happy are those who listen to God's message and keep it.'
     As the crowds increased, Jesus began to speak, 'This generation is
a wicked generation. It demands a sign, but no sign will be given it
except the sign of Jonah. For, as Jonah became a sign to the people of
Nineveh, so will the Son of Man be to this generation. At the judgment
the Queen of the South will rise up with the people of this generation,
and will condemn them, because she came from the ends of the earth to
listen to the wisdom of Solomon; and here is more than a Solomon! At the
judgment the men of Nineveh will stand up with this generation, and will
condemn it, because they repented at Jonah's proclamation; and here is
more than a Jonah! No one lights a lamp, and then puts it in the cellar
or under a basket, but he puts it on the lamp-stand, so that anyone who
comes in may see the light. The lamp of the body is your eye. When your
eye is unclouded, your whole body, also, is lit up; but, as soon as your
eye is diseased, your body, also, is darkened. Take care, therefore,
that the inner light is not darkness. If, then, your whole body is lit
up, and no corner of it darkened, the whole will be lit up, just as when
a lamp gives you light by its brilliance.'
     As Jesus finished speaking, a Pharisee asked him to breakfast with
him, and Jesus went in and took his place at the table. The Pharisee
noticed, to his astonishment, that Jesus omitted the ceremonial washing
before breakfast. But the Master said to him, 'You Pharisees do, it is
true, clean the outside of the cup and of the plate, but inside you
yourselves are filled with greed and wickedness. Fools! Did not the
maker of the outside make the inside too? Only give away what is in them
in charity, and at once you have the whole clean. But alas for you
Pharisees! You pay tithes on mint, rue, and herbs of all kinds, and pass
over justice and love to God. These last you ought to have put into
practice without neglecting the first. Alas for you Pharisees! You
delight to have the front seat in the synagogues, and to be greeted in
the markets with respect. Alas for you! You are like unsuspected graves,
over which men walk unawares.'
     Here one of the students of the Law interrupted him by saying,
'Teacher, when you say this, you are insulting us also.' But Jesus went
on, 'Alas for you, too, you students of the Law! You load people with
loads that are too heavy to carry, but do not, yourselves, touch them
with one of your fingers. Alas for you! You build the monuments of the
prophets whom your ancestors killed. You are actually witnesses to your
ancestors' acts and show your approval of them, because, while they
killed the prophets, you build tombs for them. That is why the wisdom of
God said -- "I will send to them prophets and apostles, some of whom
they will persecute and kill, in order that the blood of all the
prophets that has been spilt since the creation of the world may be
exacted from this generation -- from the blood of Abel down to the blood
of Zechariah, who was slain between the altar and the house of God."
Yes, I tell you, it will be exacted from this generation. Alas for you
students of the Law! You have taken away the key of the door of
knowledge. You have not gone in yourselves and you have hindered those
who try to go in.'
     When Jesus left the house, the teachers of the Law and the
Pharisees began to press him hard and question him closely on many
subjects, laying traps for him, so as to seize on anything that he might
say.

     Meanwhile the people had gathered in thousands, so that they trod
on one another, when Jesus, addressing himself to his disciples, began
by saying to them, 'Be on your guard against the leaven -- that is, the
hypocrisy -- of the Pharisees. There is nothing, however covered up,
which will not be uncovered, nor anything kept secret which will not
become known. So all that you have said in the dark will be heard in the
light, and what you have spoken in the ear, within closed doors, will be
proclaimed on the housetops. To you who are my friends I say, Do not be
afraid of those who kill the body, but after that can do no more. I will
show you of whom you should be afraid. Be afraid of him who, after
killing you, has the power to fling you into Gehenna. Yes, I say, be
afraid of him. Are not five sparrows sold for two copper coins? Yet not
one of them has escaped God's notice. No, even the hairs of your head
are all numbered. Do not be afraid; you are of more value than many
sparrows. Everyone, I tell you, who publicly acknowledges me, the Son of
Man, also, will acknowledge before God's angels; but the person who
publicly disowns me will be altogether disowned before God's angels.
Everyone who will say anything against the Son of Man will be forgiven,
but for the person who slanders the Holy Spirit there will be no
forgiveness. Whenever they take you before the synagogue Courts or the
magistrates or other authorities, do not be anxious as to how you will
defend yourselves, or what your defence will be, or what you will say;
for the Holy Spirit will show you at the moment what you ought to say.'
     'Teacher,' a man in the crowd said to Jesus, 'tell my brother to
share the property with me.' But Jesus said to him, 'Man, who made me a
judge or an arbiter between you?' And then he added, 'Take care to keep
yourselves free from every form of covetousness; for even in the height
of their prosperity a person's true life does not depend on what they
have.'
     Then Jesus told them this parable -- 'There was once a rich man
whose land was very fertile; and he began to ask himself "What will I
do, for I have nowhere to store my crops? This is what I will do," he
said; "I will pull down my barns and build larger ones, and store all my
grain and my goods in them; and I will say to myself, Now you have
plenty of good things put by for many years; take your ease, eat, drink,
and enjoy yourself." But God said to the man "Fool! This very night your
life is being demanded; and as for all you have prepared -- who will
have it?" So it is with those who lay by wealth for themselves and are
not rich to the glory of God.'
     And Jesus said to his disciples, 'That is why I say to you, Do not
be anxious about the life here -- what you can get to eat; or about your
body -- what you can get to wear. For life is more than food, and the
body than its clothes. Think of the ravens -- they neither sow nor reap;
they have neither storehouse nor barn; and yet God feeds them! And how
much more precious are you than birds! But which of you, by being
anxious, can prolong your life a moment? And, if you cannot do even the
smallest thing, why be anxious about other things? Think of the lilies,
and how they grow. They neither toil nor spin; yet, I tell you, even
Solomon in all his splendour was not robed like one of these. If, even
in the field, God so clothes the grass which is living today and
tomorrow will be thrown into the oven, how much more will he clothe you,
you of little faith! And you -- do not be always seeking what you can
get to eat or what you can get to drink; and do not waver. These are the
things for which all the nations of the world are seeking, and your
Father knows that you need them. No, seek his kingdom, and these things
will be added for you. So do not be afraid, my little flock, for your
Father has been pleased to give you the kingdom.
     'Sell what belongs to you, and give in charity. Make yourselves
purses that will not wear out -- an inexhaustible treasure in heaven,
where no thief comes near, or moth works ruin. For where your treasure
is, there also will your heart be. Make yourselves ready, with your
lamps alight; and be like servants who are waiting for their Master's
return from his wedding, so that, when he comes and knocks, they may
open the door for him at once. Happy are those servants whom, on his
return, the Master will find watching. I tell you that he will make
himself ready, and have them take their places at the table, and will
come and serve them. Whether it is late at night, or in the early
morning that he comes, if he finds all as it should be, then happy are
they. This you do know, that, had the owner of the house known at what
time the thief was coming, he would have been on the watch, and would
not have let his house be broken into. You must also prepare, for when
you are least expecting him the Son of Man will come.'
     'Master,' said Peter, 'are you telling this parable with reference
to us or to everyone?'
     'Who, then,' replied the Master, 'is that trustworthy steward, the
careful man, who will be placed by his master over his establishment, to
give them their rations at the proper time? Happy will that servant be
whom his master, when he comes home, will find doing this. His master, I
tell you, will put him in charge of the whole of his property. But
should that servant say to himself "My master is a long time coming,"
and begin to beat the menservants and the maidservants, and to eat and
drink and get drunk, that servant's master will come on a day when he
does not expect him, and at an hour of which he is unaware, and will
flog him severely and assign him his place among the untrustworthy. The
servant who knows his master's wishes and yet does not prepare and act
accordingly will receive many lashes; while one who does not know his
master's wishes, but acts so as to deserve a flogging, will receive but
few. From everyone to whom much has been given much will be expected,
and from the man to whom much has been entrusted the more will be
demanded. I came to cast fire on the earth; and what more can I wish, if
it is already kindled? There is a baptism that I must undergo, and how
great is my distress until it is over! Do you think that I am here to
bring peace on earth? No, I tell you, but to cause division. For from
this time, if there are five people in a house, they will be divided,
three against two, and two against three. Father will be opposed to son
and son to father, mother to daughter and daughter to mother, mother-in-
law to her daughter-in-law and daughter-in-law to her mother-in-law.'
     And to the people Jesus said, 'When you see a cloud rising in the
west, you say at once "There is a storm coming," and come it does. And
when you see that the wind is in the south, you say "It will be burning
hot," and so it proves. Hypocrites! You know how to judge of the earth
and the sky; how is it, then, that you cannot judge of this time? Why
don't you yourselves decide what is right? When, for instance, you are
going with your opponent before a magistrate, on your way to the court
do your best to be quit of him; otherwise he might drag you before the
judge, then the judge will hand you over to the bailiff of the court,
and the bailiff throw you into prison. You will not, I tell you, come
out until you have paid the very last cent.'
     Just at that time some people had come to tell Jesus about the
Galileans, whose blood Pilate had mingled with the blood of their
sacrifices. 'Do you suppose,' replied Jesus, 'that, because these
Galileans have suffered in this way, they were worse sinners than any
other Galileans? No, I tell you; but, unless you repent, you will all
perish as they did. Or those eighteen men at Siloam on whom the tower
fell, killing them all, do you suppose that they were worse offenders
than any other inhabitants of Jerusalem? No, I tell you; but, unless you
repent, you will all perish in the same manner.'
     And Jesus told them this parable -- 'A man, who had a fig tree
growing in his vineyard, came to look for fruit on it, but could not
find any. So he said to his gardener "Three years now I have come to
look for fruit on this fig tree, without finding any! Cut it down. Why
should it rob the soil?" "Leave it this one year more, Sir," the man
answered, "until I have dug round it and manured it. Then, if it bears
in future, well and good; but if not, you can have it cut down."'

     Jesus was teaching on a Sabbath in one of the synagogues, and he
saw before him a woman who for eighteen years had suffered from weakness
owing to her having an evil spirit in her. She was bent double, and was
wholly unable to raise herself. When Jesus saw her, he called her to
him, and said, 'Woman, you are released from your weakness.' He placed
his hands on her, and she was instantly made straight, and began to
praise God. But the synagogue leader, indignant that Jesus had worked
the cure on the Sabbath, intervened and said to the people, 'There are
six days on which work ought to be done; come to be cured on one of
those, and not on the Sabbath.'
     'You hypocrites!' the Master answered him. 'Does not everyone of
you let your ox or your donkey loose from its manger, and take it out to
drink, on the Sabbath? But this woman, a daughter of Abraham, who has
been kept in bondage by Satan for now eighteen years, ought not she to
have been released from her bondage on the Sabbath?' As he said this,
his opponents all felt ashamed; but all the people rejoiced to see all
the wonderful things that he was doing.
     So Jesus said, 'What is the kingdom of God like? And to what can I
liken it? It is like a mustard seed which a man took and put in his
garden. The seed grew and became a tree, and the wild birds roosted in
its branches.' And again Jesus said, 'To what can I liken the kingdom of
God? It is like some yeast which a woman took and covered in three pecks
of flour, until the whole had risen.'
     Jesus went through towns and villages, teaching as he went, and
making his way towards Jerusalem. 'Master,' someone asked, 'are there
but few in the path of salvation?' And Jesus answered, 'Strive to go in
by the narrow door. Many, I tell you, will seek to go in, but they will
not be able, when once the master of the house has got up and shut the
door, while you begin to say, as you stand outside and knock, "Sir, open
the door for us." His answer will be -- "I do not know where you come
from." Then you will begin to say "We have eaten and drunk in your
presence, and you have taught in our streets," and his reply will be --
"I do not know where you come from. Leave my presence, all you who are
living in wickedness." There, there will be weeping and grinding of
teeth, when you see Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets, in
the kingdom of God, while you yourselves are being driven outside.
People will come from East and West, and from North and South, and take
their places at the banquet in the kingdom of God. There are some who
are last now who will then be first, and some who are first now who will
then be last!'
     Just then some Pharisees came up to Jesus and said, 'Go away and
leave this place, for Herod wants to kill you.' But Jesus answered, 'Go
and say to that fox "Look you, I am driving out demons and will be
completing cures today and tomorrow, and on the third day I will have
done." But today and tomorrow and the day after I must go on my way,
because it cannot be that a prophet should meet his end outside
Jerusalem. Jerusalem! Jerusalem! You who slays the prophets and stones
the messengers sent to you -- Oh, how often have I wished to gather your
children round me, as a hen takes her brood under her wings, and you
would not come! Verily your house is left to you desolate! And never, I
tell you, will you see me, until you say --

     "Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord."'

     On one occasion, as Jesus was going, on a Sabbath into the house of
one of the leading Pharisees to dine, they were watching him closely.
There he saw before him a man who was suffering from dropsy. 'Is it
allowable,' said Jesus, addressing the students of the Law and the
Pharisees, 'to work a cure on the Sabbath, or is it not?' They remained
silent. Jesus took hold of the man and cured him, and sent him away. And
he said to them, 'Which of you, finding that your son or your ox has
fallen into a well, will not immediately pull them out on the Sabbath
day?' And they could not make any answer to that.
     Observing that the guests were choosing the best places for
themselves, Jesus told them this parable -- 'When you are invited by
anyone to a wedding banquet, do not seat yourself in the best place.
Someone of higher rank might have been invited by your host; and the
host who invited you both will come and say to you "Make room for this
person," and then you will begin in confusion to take the lowest place.
No, when you are invited, go and take the lowest place, so that, when
the host who has invited you comes, he may say to you "Friend, come
higher up"; and then you will be honoured in the eyes of all your fellow
guests. For everyone who exalts themselves will be humbled, and everyone
who humbles themselves will be exalted.'
     Then Jesus went on to say to the man who had invited him, 'When you
give a breakfast or a dinner, do not ask your friends, or your brothers
or sisters, or your relatives, or rich neighbours, because they might
invite you in return, and so you should be repaid. No, when you
entertain, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, the blind; and then
you will be happy indeed, since they cannot reward you; for you will be
rewarded at the resurrection of the just.'
     One of the guests heard what he said and exclaimed, 'Happy will be
the person who will eat bread in the kingdom of God!' But Jesus said to
him, 'A man was once giving a great dinner. He invited many people, and
sent his servant, when it was time for the dinner, to say to those who
had been invited "Come, for everything is now ready." They all with one
accord began to ask to be excused. The first said to the servant "I have
bought a field and am obliged to go and look at it. I must ask you to
consider me excused." The next said "I have bought five pairs of
bullocks, and I am on my way to try them. I must ask you to consider me
excused"; while the next said "I am just married, and for that reason I
am unable to come." On his return the servant told his master all these
answers. Then in anger the owner of the house said to his servant "Go
out at once into the streets and alleys of the town, and bring in here
the poor, and the crippled, and the blind, and the lame." Presently the
servant said "Sir, your order has been carried out, and still there is
room." "Go out," the master said, "into the roads and hedgerows, and
make people come in, so that my house may be filled; for I tell you all
that not one of those people who were invited will taste my dinner."'
     One day, when great crowds of people were walking with Jesus, he
turned and said to them, 'If any one comes to me and does not hate their
father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brothers, and sisters,
yes and even their life, he can be no disciple of mine. Whoever does not
carry their own cross, and walk in my steps, can be no disciple of mine.
Why, which of you, when you want to build a tower, does not first sit
down and reckon the cost, to see if you have enough to complete it? --
Otherwise, if you have laid the foundation and are not able to finish
it, everyone who sees it will laugh at you, and say "Here is a person
who began to build and was not able to finish!" Or what king, when he is
setting out to fight another king, does not first sit down and consider
if with ten thousand men he is able to meet one who is coming against
him with twenty thousand? And if he cannot, then, while the other is
still at a distance, he sends envoys and asks for terms of peace. And so
with everyone of you who does not bid farewell to all you have -- you
cannot be a disciple of mine. Yes, salt is good; but, if the salt itself
should lose its strength, what will be used to season it? It is not fit
either for the land or for the manure heap. People throw it away. Let
those who have ears to hear with hear!'

     The tax collectors and the outcasts were all drawing near to Jesus
to listen to him; but the Pharisees and the teachers of the Law found
fault.
     'This man always welcomes outcasts, and takes meals with them!'
they complained.
     So Jesus told them this parable -- 'Who among you who has a hundred
sheep, and has lost one of them, does not leave the ninety-nine out in
the open country, and go after the lost sheep until he finds it? And,
when he has found it, he puts it on his shoulders rejoicing; and, on
reaching home, he calls his friends and his neighbours together, and
says "Come and rejoice with me, for I have found my sheep which was
lost." So, I tell you, there will be more rejoicing in heaven over one
outcast who repents, than over ninety-nine religious people, who have no
need to repent. Or again, what woman who has ten silver coins, if she
loses one of them, does not light a lamp, and sweep the house, and
search carefully until she finds it? And, when she has found it, she
calls her friends and neighbours together, and says "Come and rejoice
with me, for I have found the coin which I lost." So, I tell you, there
is rejoicing in the presence of God's angels over one outcast who
repents.'
     Then Jesus continued, 'A man had two sons; and the younger of them
said to his father "Father, give me my share of the inheritance." So the
father divided the property between them. A few days later the younger
son got together all that he had, and went away into a distant land; and
there he squandered his inheritance by leading a dissolute life. After
he has spent all that he had, there was a severe famine through all that
country, and he began to be in actual want. So he went and engaged
himself to one of the people of that country, who sent him into his
fields to tend pigs. He even longed to satisfy his hunger with the bean-
pods on which the pigs were feeding; and no one gave him anything. But,
when he came to himself, he said "How many of my father's hired servants
have more bread than they can eat, while here am I starving to death! I
will get up and go to my father, and say to him 'Father, I sinned
against heaven and against you; I am no longer fit to be called your
son; make me one of your hired servants.'" And he got up and went to his
father. But, while he was still a long way off, his father saw him and
was deeply moved; he ran and threw his arms round his neck and kissed
him. "Father," the son said, "I sinned against heaven and against you; I
am no longer fit to be called your son; make me one of your hired
servants." But the father turned to his servants and said "Be quick and
fetch a robe -- the very best -- and put it on him; give him a ring for
his finger and sandals for his feet; and bring the fattened calf and
kill it, and let us eat and make merry; for here is my son who was dead,
and is alive again, was lost, and is found." So they began making merry.
Meanwhile the elder son was out in the fields; but, on coming home, when
he got near the house, he heard music and dancing, and he called one of
the servants and asked what it all meant. "Your brother has come back,"
the servant told him, "and your father has killed the fattened calf,
because he has him back safe and sound." This made him angry, and he
would not go in. But his father came out and begged him to do so. "No,"
he said to his father, "look at all the years I have been serving you,
without ever once disobeying you, and yet you have never given me even a
young goat, so that I might have a party with my friends. But, no sooner
has this son of yours come, who has eaten up your property in the
company of prostitutes, than you have killed the fattened calf for him."
"Child," the father answered, "you are always with me, and everything
that I have is yours. But how could we not celebrate and rejoice? Here
is your brother who was dead and is alive, who was lost and is found."'
     Jesus said to his disciples, 'There was a rich man who had a
steward; and this steward was maliciously accused to him of wasting his
estate. So the master called him and said "What is this that I hear
about you? Give in your accounts, for you cannot act as steward any
longer." "What am I to do," the steward asked himself, "now that my
master is taking the steward's place away from me? I have not strength
to dig, and I am ashamed to beg. I know what I will do, so that, as soon
as I am turned out of my stewardship, people may welcome me into their
homes." One by one he called up his master's debtors. "How much do you
owe my master?" he asked of the first. "Four hundred and forty gallons
of oil," answered the man. "Here is your agreement," he said; "sit down
at once and make it two hundred and twenty." And you, the steward said
to the next, "how much do you owe?" "Seventy quarters of wheat," he
replied. "Here is your agreement," the steward said; "make it fifty-
six." His master complimented this dishonest steward on the shrewdness
of his action. And indeed men of the world are shrewder in dealing with
their fellow men than those who have the light. And I say to you "Win
friends for yourselves with your dishonest money," so that, when it
comes to an end, there may be a welcome for you into the Eternal Home.
The person who is trustworthy in the smallest matter is trustworthy in a
great one also; and the person who is dishonest in the smallest matter
is dishonest in a great one also. So, if you have proved untrustworthy
with the dishonest money, who will trust you with the true? And, if you
have proved untrustworthy with what does not belong to us, who will give
you what is really our own? No servant can serve two masters, for,
either they will hate one and love the other, or else they will attach
themselves to one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and
money.'
     All this was said within hearing of the Pharisees, who were lovers
of money, and they began to sneer at Jesus.
     'You,' said Jesus, 'are the ones who justify themselves before the
world, but God can read your hearts; and what is highly esteemed among
people may be an abomination in the sight of God. The Law and the
prophets sufficed until the time of John. Since then the good news of
the kingdom of God has been told, and everybody has been forcing their
way into it. It would be easier for the heavens and the earth to
disappear than for one stroke of a letter in the Law to be lost.
Everyone who divorces his wife and marries another woman is an
adulterer, and the man who marries a divorced woman is an adulterer.
There was once a rich man, who dressed in purple robes and fine linen,
and feasted every day in great splendour. Near his gateway there had
been laid a beggar named Lazarus, who was covered with sores, and who
longed to satisfy his hunger with what fell from the rich man's table.
Even the dogs came and licked his sores. After a time the beggar died,
and was taken by the angels to be with Abraham. The rich man also died
and was buried. In Hades he looked up in his torment, and saw Abraham at
a distance and Lazarus at his side. So he called out "Pity me, Father
Abraham, and send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool
my tongue, for I am suffering agony in this flame." "Child," answered
Abraham, "remember that you in your lifetime received what you thought
desirable, just as Lazarus received what was not desirable; but now he
has his consolation here, while you are suffering agony. And not only
that, but between you and us there lies a great chasm, so that those who
wish to pass from here to you cannot, nor can they cross from there to
us." "Then, Father," he said, "I beg you to send Lazarus to my father's
house where I have five brothers, to warn them, so that they will not
also come to this place of torture." "They have the writings of Moses
and the prophets," replied Abraham. "Let them listen to them." "But,
Father Abraham," he urged, "if someone from the dead were to go to them,
they would repent." "If they do not listen to Moses and the prophets,"
answered Abraham, "they will not be persuaded, even if someone were to
rise from the dead."'
     Jesus said to his disciples, 'It is inevitable that there should be
temptations but sorrow awaits the person who does the tempting! It would
be better for them if they had been flung into the sea with a millstone
round their neck, rather than that they should cause even one of these
little ones to stumble. Be on your guard! If your brother or sister does
wrong, rebuke them; but if they repent, forgive them. Even if they wrong
you seven times a day, but turns to you every time and says "I am
sorry," you must forgive them.'
     'Give us more faith,' said the apostles to the Master; but the
Master said, 'If your faith were only like a mustard seed, you could say
to this mulberry tree "Be uprooted and planted in the sea," and it would
obey you. Which of you, if he had a servant ploughing, or tending the
sheep, would say to him, when he came in from the fields, "Come at once
and take your place at the table," Instead of saying "Prepare my dinner,
and then make yourself ready and serve me while I am eating and
drinking, and after that you will eat and drink yourself"? Does he feel
grateful to his servant for doing what he is told? And so with you --
when you have done all that you have been told, still say "We are but
useless servants; we have done no more than we ought to have done."'

     On the way to Jerusalem Jesus passed between Samaria and Galilee.
As he was entering a village, ten lepers met him. Standing still, some
distance off, they called out loudly, 'Jesus! Sir! Pity us!' When Jesus
saw them, he said, 'Go and show yourselves to the priest.' And, as they
were on their way, they were made clean. One of them, finding he was
cured, came back, praising God loudly, and threw himself on his face at
Jesus' feet, thanking him for what he had done; and this man was a
Samaritan. 'Were not all the ten made clean? exclaimed Jesus. But the
nine -- where are they? Were there none to come back and praise God
except this foreigner? Get up,' he said to him, 'and go on your way.
Your faith has delivered you.'

     Being once asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God was to
come, Jesus answered, 'The kingdom of God does not come in a way that
can be seen, nor will people say "Look, here it is!" or "There it is!";
for the kingdom of God is within you! The day will come,' he said to his
disciples, 'when you will long to see but one of the days of the Son of
Man, and will not see it. People will say to you "There he is!" Or "Here
he is!" Do not go and follow them. For, just as lightning will lighten
and flare from one side of the heavens to the other, so will it be with
the Son of Man. But first he must undergo much suffering, and he must be
rejected by the present generation. As it was in the days of Noah, so
will it be again in the days of the Son of Man. They were eating and
drinking and marrying and being married, up to the very day on which
Noah entered the ark, and then the flood came and destroyed them all.
So, too, in the days of Lot. People were eating, drinking, buying,
selling, planting, building; but, on the very day on which Lot came out
of Sodom, it rained fire and sulphur from the skies and destroyed them
all. It will be the same on the day on which the Son of Man reveals
himself. On that day, if a person is on their house-top and their goods
in the house, they must not go down to get them; nor again must one who
is on the farm turn back. Remember Lot's wife. Whoever is eager to get
the most out of their life will lose it; but whoever will lose it will
preserve it. On that night, I tell you, of two people on the same bed,
one will be taken and the other left; of two women grinding grain
together, one will be taken and the other left.' {  (17:36)  Some later
manuscripts add: There will be two in the field; one will be taken and
the other left. }
     'Where will it be, Master?' asked the disciples. 'Where there is a
body,' said Jesus, 'there will the vultures flock.'

     Jesus told his disciples a parable to show them that they should
always pray and never despair. 'There was,' he said, 'in a certain town
a judge, who had no fear of God nor regard for people. In the same town
there was a widow who went to him again and again, and said "Grant me
justice against my opponent." For a time the judge refused, but
afterwards he said to himself "Although I am without fear of God or
regard for people, yet, as this widow is so troublesome, I will grant
her justice, to stop her from plaguing me with her endless visits."'
Then the Master added, 'Listen to what this iniquitous judge says! And
God -- won't he see that his own people, who cry to him night and day,
have justice done them -- though he holds his hand? He will, I tell you,
give them justice soon enough! Yet, when the Son of Man comes, will he
find faith on earth?'
     Another time, speaking to people who were satisfied that they were
religious, and who regarded everyone else with scorn, Jesus told this
parable -- 'Two men went up into the Temple Courts to pray. One was a
Pharisee and the other a tax-gatherer. The Pharisee stood forward and
began praying to himself in this way -- "God, I thank you that I am not
like other men -- thieves, rogues, adulterers -- or even like this tax-
gatherer. I fast twice a week, and give a tenth of everything I get to
God." Meanwhile the tax-gatherer stood at a distance, not venturing even
to raise his eyes to heaven, but he kept striking his breast and saying
"God, have mercy on me, a sinner." This man, I tell you, went home
pardoned, rather than the other. For everyone who exalts himself will be
humbled, while everyone who humbles himself will be exalted.'

     Some of the people were bringing even their babies to Jesus, for
him to touch them; but, when the disciples saw it, they began to find
fault with those who had brought them. Jesus, however, called the little
children to him. 'Let the little children come to me,' he said, 'and do
not hinder them, for it is to the childlike that the kingdom of God
belongs. I tell you, unless a man receives the kingdom of God like a
child, he will not enter it at all.'
     And one of the leaders asked Jesus this question -- 'Good teacher,
what must I do if I am to gain eternal life?'
     'Why do you call me good?' answered Jesus. 'No one is good but God.
You know the commandments -- Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not
steal, Do not say what is false about others, Honour your father and
your mother.'
     'I have observed all these,' he replied, 'from childhood.' Hearing
this, Jesus said to him, 'There is one thing still lacking in you; sell
everything that you have, and distribute to the poor, and you will have
wealth in heaven; then come and follow me.' But the man became greatly
distressed on hearing this, for he was extremely rich. Seeing this,
Jesus said to his disciples, 'How hard it is for the wealthy to enter
the kingdom of God! It is easier, indeed, for a camel to get through a
needle's eye than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God!'
     'Then who can be saved?' asked those who heard this. But Jesus
said, 'What is impossible with people is possible with God.'
     'But we,' said Peter, 'we left what belonged to us and followed
you.'
     'I tell you,' he answered, 'that there is no one who has left
house, or wife, or brothers, or parents, or children, for the sake of
the kingdom of God, who will not receive many times as much in the
present, and in the age that is coming eternal life.'
     Gathering the Twelve round him, Jesus said to them, 'Listen! We are
going up to Jerusalem; and there everything that is written in the
prophets will be done to the Son of Man. For he will be given up to the
Gentiles, mocked, insulted and spat on; they will scourge him, and then
put him to death; and on the third day he will rise again.' The apostles
did not comprehend any of this. His meaning was unintelligible to them
and they did not understand what he was saying.

     As Jesus was getting near Jericho, a blind man was sitting by the
roadside, begging. Hearing a crowd going by, the man asked what was the
matter; and, when people told him that Jesus of Nazareth was passing, he
shouted out, 'Jesus, Son of David, take pity on me!' Those who were in
front kept telling him to be quiet, but he continued to call out the
louder, 'Son of David, take pity on me!' Then Jesus stopped and ordered
the man to be brought to him. And, when he had come close up to him,
Jesus asked him, 'What do you want me to do for you?'
     'Master,' he said, 'I want to recover my sight.' And Jesus said,
'Recover your sight, your faith has delivered you.' Instantly he
recovered his sight, and began to follow Jesus, praising God. And all
the people, on seeing it, gave glory to God.

     Jesus entered Jericho and made his way through the town. There was
a man there, known by the name of Zacchaeus, who was a senior tax
collector and a rich man. He tried to see what Jesus was like; but,
being short, he was unable to do so because of the crowd. So he ran on
ahead and climbed into a mulberry tree to see Jesus, for he knew that he
must pass that way. When Jesus came to the place, he looked up and said
to him, 'Zacchaeus, be quick and come down, for I must stop at your
house today.' So Zacchaeus got down quickly, and joyfully welcomed him.
On seeing this, everyone began to complain, 'He has gone to stay with a
man who is an outcast.' But Zacchaeus stood forward and said to the
Master, 'Listen, Master! I will give half my property to the poor, and,
if I have defrauded anyone of anything, I will give him back four times
as much.'
     'Salvation has come to this house today,' answered Jesus, 'for even
this man is a son of Abraham. The Son of Man has come to search for
those who are lost and to save them.'
     As the people were listening to this, Jesus went on to tell them a
parable. He did so because he was near Jerusalem, and because they
thought that the kingdom of God was going to be proclaimed at once. He
said, 'A nobleman once went to a distant country to receive his
appointment to a kingdom and then return. He called ten of his servants
and gave them ten pounds of silver each, and told them to trade with
them during his absence. But his subjects hated him and sent envoys
after him to say "We will not have this man as our king." On his return,
after having been appointed king, he directed that the servants to whom
he had given his money should be summoned, so that he might learn what
amount of trade they had done. The first came up, and said "Sir, your
ten pounds have made a hundred." "Well done, good servant!" exclaimed
the master. "As you have proved trustworthy in a very small matter, I
appoint you governor over ten towns." When the second came, he said
"Your ten pounds, Sir, have produced fifty." So the master said to him
"And you I appoint over five towns." Another servant also came and said
"Sir, here are your ten pounds; I have kept them put away in a
handkerchief. For I was afraid of you, because you are a stern man. You
take what you have not planted, and reap what you have not sown." The
master answered "Out of your own mouth I judge you, you worthless
servant. You knew that I am a stern man, that I take what I have not
planted, and reap what I have not sown? Then why didn't you put my money
into a bank? And I, on my return, could have claimed it with interest.
Take away from him the ten pounds," he said to those standing by, "and
give them to the one who has the hundred." "But, Sir," they said, "he
has a hundred pounds already!" "I tell you," he answered, "that, to him
who has, more will be given, but, from him who has nothing, even what he
has will be taken away. But as for my enemies, these men who would not
have me as their king, bring them here and put them to death in my
presence."'
     After saying this, Jesus went on in front, going up to Jerusalem.

*The Last Days*

     It was when Jesus had almost reached Bethphage and Bethany, near
the Mount of Olives, that he sent on two of the disciples. 'Go to the
village facing us,' he said, 'and, when you get there, you will find a
foal tethered, which no one has yet ridden; untie it and lead it here.
And, if anybody asks you "Why are you untying it?", you are to say this
-- "The Master wants it."' So the two who were sent went and found it as
Jesus had told them. While they were untying the foal, the owners asked
them -- 'Why are you untying the foal?' And the two disciples answered
-- 'The Master wants it.' Then they led it back to Jesus, and threw
their cloaks on the foal and put Jesus on it. As he went along, the
people kept spreading their cloaks in the road. When he had almost
reached the place where the road led down the Mount of Olives, everyone
of the many disciples began in their joy to praise God loudly for all
the miracles that they had seen:

     'Blessed is He who comes --our king -- in the name of the Lord!
     Peace in heaven,
         and glory on high.'
 Some of the Pharisees in the crowd said to him, 'Teacher, restrain your
disciples.' But Jesus answered, 'I tell you that if they are silent, the
stones will call out.'
     When he drew near, on seeing the city, he wept over it, and said,
'If only you had known, while yet there was time -- even you -- the
things that make for peace! But now they have been hidden from your
sight. For a time is coming when your enemies will surround you with
earthworks, and encircle you, and hem you in on all sides; they will
trample you down and your children within you, and they will not leave
in you one stone on another, because you did not know the time of your
visitation.'
     Jesus went into the Temple Courts and began to drive out those who
were selling, saying as he did so, 'Scripture says -- "My house will be
a house of prayer"; but you have made it a den of robbers.'

     Jesus continued to teach each day in the Temple Courts; but the
chief priests and teachers of the Law were eager to take his life, and
so also were the leaders of the people. Yet they could not see what to
do, for the people all hung on his words.

     On one of these days, when Jesus was teaching the people in the
Temple Courts and telling the good news, the chief priests and the
teachers of the Law, joined by the elders, confronted him, and
addressing him, said, 'Tell us what authority you have to do these
things. Who is it who has given you this authority?'
     'I, too,' said Jesus in reply, 'will ask you one question. Give me
an answer to it. It is about John's baptism -- was it of divine or of
human origin?' But they began arguing together, 'If we say "divine," he
will say "Why didn't you believe him?" But, if we say "human," the
people will all stone us, for they are persuaded that John was a
prophet.' So they answered that they did not know its origin. 'Then I,'
said Jesus, 'refuse to tell you what authority I have to do these
things.'
     But Jesus began to tell the people this parable -- 'A man once
planted a vineyard, and then let it out to tenants, and went abroad for
a long while. At the proper time he sent a servant to the tenants, so
that they could give him a share of the produce of the vineyard. The
tenants, however, beat him and sent him away empty-handed. The owner
afterwards sent another servant; but the tenants beat and insulted this
man too, and sent him away empty-handed. He sent a third; but they
wounded this man also, and threw him outside. "What should I do?" said
the owner of the vineyard. "I will send my son, who is very dear to me.
Perhaps they will respect him." But, on seeing him, the tenants
consulted with one another. "Here is the heir!" they said. "Let us kill
him, and then the inheritance will become ours." So they threw him
outside the vineyard and killed him. Now what will the owner of the
vineyard do to them? He will come and put those tenants to death, and
will let the vineyard to others.'
     'Heaven forbid!' they exclaimed when they heard it. But Jesus
looked at them and said, 'What then is the meaning of this passage? --

     "The stone which the builders despised has now itself become the
cornerstone."
 Everyone who falls on that stone will be dashed to pieces, while anyone
on whom it falls -- it will scatter him as dust.'
     After this the teachers of the Law and the chief priest were eager
to lay hands on Jesus then and there, but they were afraid of the
people; for they saw that it was at them that he had aimed this parable.
Having watched their opportunity, they afterwards sent some spies, who
pretended to be good men, to catch Jesus in the course of conversation,
and so enable them to give him up to the Governor's jurisdiction and
authority. These spies asked Jesus a question. They said, 'Teacher, we
know that you are right in what you say and teach, and that you do not
take any account of a person's position, but teach the way of God
honestly; are we right in paying tribute to the Emperor or not?' Seeing
through their deceitfulness, Jesus said to them, 'Show me a coin. Whose
head and title are on it?'
     'The Emperor's,' they said; and Jesus replied, 'Well then, pay to
the Emperor what belongs to the Emperor, and to God what belongs to
God.' They could not object to this answer before the people; and, in
their wonder at his reply, they held their tongues.

     Presently there came up some Sadducees, who maintain that there is
no resurrection. Their question was this -- 'Teacher, Moses laid down
for us in his writings that --

     "Should a man's married brother die, and should he be childless,
the man should take the widow as his wife, and raise up a family for his
brother."
 Well, there were once seven brothers; of whom the eldest, after taking
a wife, died childless. The second and third brothers both took her as
their wife; and so, too, did all seven -- dying without children. The
woman herself was the last to die. About the woman, then -- at the
resurrection, whose wife is she to be, all seven brothers having had her
as their wife?'
     'The men and women of this world,' said Jesus, 'marry and are given
in marriage; but, for those who are thought worthy to attain to that
other world and the resurrection from the dead, there is no marrying or
being married, nor indeed can they die again, for they are like angels
and, having shared in the resurrection, they are God's children. As to
the fact that the dead rise, even Moses indicated that, in the passage
about the Bush, when he calls the Lord --

     "The God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob."
 Now he is not God of dead people, but of living. For in his sight all
are alive.'
     'Well said, teacher!' exclaimed some of the teachers of the Law,
for they did not venture to question him any further. But Jesus said to
them, 'How is it that people say that the Christ is to be David's son?
For David, in the book of Psalms, says himself --

     "The Lord said to my lord: Sit at my right hand,
     until I put your enemies as a stool for your feet."
 David, then, calls him "lord," so how is he David's son?'
     While all the people were listening, Jesus said to the disciples,
'Be on your guard against the teachers of the Law, who delight to walk
about in long robes, and like to be greeted in the streets with respect,
and to have the best seats in the synagogues, and places of honour at
dinner. These are the men who rob widows of their houses, and make a
pretence of saying long prayers. Their sentence will be all the
heavier.'
     Looking up, Jesus saw the rich people putting their gifts into the
chests for the Temple offerings. He saw, too, a widow in poor
circumstances putting two small coins into them. 'I tell you', he said
'that this poor widow has put in more than all the others; for everyone
else here put in something from what he had to spare, while she, in her
need, has put in all she had to live on.'

     When some of them spoke about the Temple being decorated with
beautiful stones and offerings, Jesus said, 'As for these things that
you are looking at, a time is coming when not one stone will be left on
another here. Every one will be thrown down.' So the disciples
questioned Jesus, 'But, teacher, when will this happen? And what sign
will there be when this is near?'
     And Jesus said, 'See that you are not led astray; for many will
take my name, and come saying "I am He," and "The time is close at
hand." Do not follow them. And, when you hear of wars and disturbances,
do not be terrified, for these things must occur first; but the end will
not be at once.' Then he said to them, 'Nation will rise against nation
and kingdom against kingdom, and there will be great earthquakes, and
plagues and famines in various places, and there will be terrible
appearances and signs in the heavens. Before all this, they will lay
hands on you and persecute you, and they will betray you to synagogues
and put you in prison, when you will be brought before kings and
governors for the sake of my name. Then will be your opportunity of
witnessing for me. Make up your minds, therefore, not to prepare your
defence; for I will myself give you words, and a wisdom which all your
opponents together will be unable to resist or defy. You will be
betrayed even by your parents and brothers and sisters and relatives and
friends, and they will cause some of you to be put to death, and you
will be hated by everyone because of me my name. Yet not a single hair
of your heads will be lost! By your endurance you will win yourselves
life. As soon, however, as you see Jerusalem surrounded by armed camps,
then you may know that the hour of her desecration is at hand. Then
those of you who are in Judea must take refuge in the mountains, those
who are in Jerusalem must leave at once, and those who are in the
country places must not go into it. For these are to be the days of
vengeance, when all that scripture says will be fulfilled. Alas for
pregnant women, and for those who are nursing infants in those days! For
there will be great suffering in the land, and anger against this
people. They will fall by the edge of the sword, and will be taken
prisoners to every land, and Jerusalem will be under the heel of the
Gentiles, until their day is over -- as it will be. There will be signs,
too, in the sun and moon and stars, and on the earth despair among the
nations, in their dismay at the roar of the sea and the surge. People's
hearts will fail them through dread of what is coming upon the world;
for the forces of the heavens will be convulsed. Then will be seen the
Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory. And, when these
things begin to occur, look upwards and lift your heads, for your
deliverance will be at hand.'
     Then he taught them a lesson, saying -- 'Look at the fig tree and
all the other trees. As soon as they shoot, you know, as you look at
them, without being told, that summer is near. And so may you, as soon
as you see these things happening, know that the kingdom of God is near.
I tell you that even the present generation will not pass away until all
has taken place. The heavens and the earth will pass away, but my words
will never pass away. Be on your guard or your minds will become dulled
by debauches or drunkenness or the anxieties of life, and "that day"
will close on you suddenly like a trap. For it will come on all who are
living upon the face of the whole earth. Be on the watch at all times,
and pray that you may have strength to escape all that is destined to
happen, and to stand in the presence of the Son of Man.'

     During the days, Jesus continued to teach in the Temple Courts, but
he went out and spent the nights on the hill called the "Mount of
Olives." And all the people would get up early in the morning and come
to listen to him in the Temple Courts.

     The feast of the unleavened bread, known as the Passover, was near.
The chief priest and the teachers of the Law were looking for an
opportunity of destroying Jesus, for they were afraid of the people.
     Now Satan took possession of Judas, who was known as Iscariot, and
who belonged to the Twelve; and he went and discussed with the chief
priests and officers in charge at the Temple the best way of betraying
Jesus to them. They were glad of this, and agreed to pay him. So Judas
assented, and looked for an opportunity to betray Jesus to them, in the
absence of a crowd.
     When the day of the Festival of the unleavened bread came, on which
the Passover lambs had to be killed, Jesus sent forward Peter and John,
saying to them, 'Go and make preparations for our eating the Passover.'
     'Where do you wish us to make preparations?' they asked. 'Listen,'
he answered, 'when you have reached the city, a man carrying a pitcher
of water will meet you; follow him into whatever house he enters; and
you will say to the owner of the house "The teacher says to you -- Where
is the room where I am to eat the Passover with my disciples?" The man
will show you a large upstairs room, set out; there make preparations.'
     So Peter and John went on, and found everything just as Jesus had
told them, and they prepared the Passover.
     When the time came, Jesus took his place at the table, and the
apostles with him. 'I have most earnestly wished,' he said, 'to eat this
Passover with you before I suffer. For I tell you that I will not eat it
again, until it has had its fulfilment in the kingdom of God.' Then, on
receiving a cup, after saying the thanksgiving, he said, 'Take this and
share it among you. For I tell you that I will not, after today, drink
of the fruit of the vine, until the kingdom of God has come.' Then Jesus
took some bread, and, after saying the thanksgiving, broke it and gave
to them, with the words, 'This is my body. {  (22:20)  Some later
manuscripts add: which is now to be given on your behalf. Do this in
memory of me. And in the same way with the cup, after supper, saying:
'This cup is the New Covenant made by my blood which is being poured out
on your behalf.' } Yet see! The hand of the man who is betraying me is
beside me on the table! True, the Son of Man is passing, by the way
ordained for him, yet alas for that man by whom he is being betrayed!'
Then they began questioning one another which of them it could be who
was going to do this.
     And a dispute arose among them as to which of them was to be
regarded as the greatest. Jesus, however, said, 'The kings of the
Gentiles lord it over them, and their oppressors are styled
"Benefactors." But with you it must not be so. No, let the greatest
among you become like the youngest, and him who leads like him who
serves. Which is the greater -- the master at the table or his servant?
Is not it the master at the table? Yet I myself am among you as one who
serves. You are the men who have stood by me in my trials; and, just as
my Father has assigned me a kingdom, I assign you places, so that you
may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and be seated on twelve
thrones as judges of the twelve tribes of Israel. Simon! Simon! listen.
Satan demanded leave to sift you all like wheat, but I prayed for you,
Simon, that your faith should not fail. And you, when you have returned
to me, are to strengthen the others.'
     'Master,' said Peter, 'with you I am ready to go both to prison and
to death.'
     'I tell you, Peter,' replied Jesus, 'the cock will not crow today
until you have disowned all knowledge of me three times.' Then he said
to them all, 'When I sent you out as my messengers, without either
purse, or bag, or sandals, were you in need of anything?'
     'No; nothing,' they answered. 'Now, however,' he said, 'he who has
a purse must take it and his bag as well; and he who has not must sell
his cloak and buy a sword. For, I tell you, that passage of scripture
must be fulfilled in me, which says -- "He was counted among the
godless"; indeed all that refers to me is finding its fulfilment.'
     'Master,' they exclaimed, 'look, here are two swords!'
     'Enough!' said Jesus.

     Jesus then went out, and made his way as usual to the Mount of
Olives, followed by his disciples. And, when he reached the spot, he
said to them, 'Pray that you may not fall into temptation.' Then he
withdrew about a stone's throw, and knelt down and began to pray.
'Father,' he said, 'if it is your pleasure, spare me this cup; only, not
my will but yours be done.' Presently there appeared to him an angel
from heaven, who strengthened him.{  (22:43)  Some later manuscripts do
not contain verses 43 or 44. } And, as his anguish became intense, he
prayed still more earnestly, while his sweat was like great drops of
blood falling on the ground. Then he rose from praying, and came to the
disciples and found them sleeping for sorrow. 'Why are you asleep?' he
asked them. 'Rise and pray so that you don't fall into temptation.'
While he was still speaking, a crowd appeared in sight, led by the man
called Judas, who was one of the Twelve. Judas approached Jesus, to kiss
him; at which Jesus said to him, 'Judas, is it by a kiss that you betray
the Son of Man?' But when those who were round Jesus saw what was going
to happen, they exclaimed, 'Master, should we use our swords?' And one
of them struck the high priest's servant and cut off his right ear; at
which Jesus said, 'Let me at least do this'; and, touching his ear, he
healed the wound. Then, turning to the chief priests and officers in
charge at the Temple and the elders, who had come for him, he said,
'Have you come out, as if after a robber, with swords and clubs? When I
was with you day after day in the Temple Courts, you did not lay hands
on me; but now your time has come, and the power of darkness.'
     Those who had taken Jesus prisoner took him away into the house of
the high priest. Peter followed at a distance. But, when they had lit a
fire in the centre of the courtyard and had all sat down there, Peter
seated himself in the middle of them. Presently a maidservant saw him
sitting near the blaze of the fire. She looked carefully at him and
said, 'Why, this man was one of his companions!' But Peter denied it. 'I
do not know him,' he replied. A little while afterwards someone else --
a man -- saw him and said, 'Why, you are one of them!'
     'No,' Peter said, 'I am not.' About an hour later another man
declared positively, 'This man also was certainly with him. Why, he is a
Galilean!' But Peter said, 'I do not know what you are speaking about.'
Instantly, while he was still speaking, a cock crowed. And the Master
turned and looked at Peter; and Peter remembered the words that the
Master had said to him -- 'Before a cock has crowed today, you will
disown me three times'; and he went outside and wept bitterly.

     The men who held Jesus kept making sport of him and beating him.
They blindfolded him and then questioned him. 'Now play the prophet,'
they said. 'Who was it that struck you?' And they heaped many other
insults on him.

     At daybreak the assembly of the elders of the people met -- both
the chief priests and the teachers of the Law -- and took Jesus before
their High Council. 'If you are the Christ,' they said, 'tell us so.'
     'If I tell you,' replied Jesus, 'you will not believe me; and, if I
question you, you will not answer. But from this hour the Son of Man
will be seated on the right hand of God Almighty.'
     'Are you, then, the Son of God?' they all asked. 'It is true,'
answered Jesus, 'I am.' At this they exclaimed, 'Why do we want any more
evidence? We have heard it ourselves from his own lips!'
     Then they all rose in a body and led Jesus before Pilate. And they
began to accuse him, 'This is a man whom we found misleading our people,
preventing them from paying taxes to the Emperor, and giving out that he
himself is "Christ, a king."'
     'Are you the king of the Jews?' Pilate asked him. 'It is true,'
replied Jesus. But Pilate, turning to the chief priests and the people,
said, 'I do not see anything to find fault with in this man.' But they
insisted, 'He is stirring up the people by his teaching all through
Judea; he began with Galilee and has now come here.' Hearing this,
Pilate asked if the man was a Galilean; and, having satisfied himself
that Jesus came under Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who
also was at Jerusalem at the time. When Herod saw Jesus, he was
exceedingly pleased, for he had been wanting to see him for a long time,
having heard a great deal about him; and he was hoping to see some sign
given by him. So he questioned him at some length, but Jesus made no
reply. Meanwhile the chief priests and the teachers of the Law stood by
and vehemently accused him. And Herod, with his soldiers, treated Jesus
with scorn; he mocked him by throwing a gorgeous robe round him, and
then sent him back to Pilate. And Herod and Pilate became friends that
very day, for before that there had been ill-will between them.
     So Pilate summoned the chief priests, and the leading men, and the
people, and said to them, 'You brought this man before me charged with
misleading the people; and yet, for my part, though I examined him
before you, I did not find this man to blame for any of the things of
which you accuse him; nor did Herod either; for he has sent him back to
us. And, as a fact, he has not done anything deserving death; so I will
have him scourged, and then release him.' {  (23:17)  Some later
manuscripts add: He had to release someone to them at the feast. } But
they began to shout as one man, 'Kill this fellow, but release Barabbas
for us.' (Barabbas was a man who had been put in prison for a riot that
had broken out in the city and for murder.) Pilate, however, wanting to
release Jesus, called to them again; but they kept calling out,
'Crucify, crucify him!'
     'Why, what harm has this man done?' Pilate said to them for the
third time. 'I have found nothing in him for which he could be condemned
to death. So I will have him scourged, and then release him.' But they
persisted in loudly demanding his crucifixion; and their clamour gained
the day. Pilate decided that their demand should be granted. He released
the man who had been put in prison for riot and murder, as they
demanded, and gave Jesus up to be dealt with as they pleased.

     And, as they were leading Jesus away, they laid hold of Simon from
Cyrene, who was on his way in from the country, and they put the cross
on his shoulders, for him to carry it behind Jesus. There was a great
crowd of people following him, many being women who were beating their
breasts and wailing for him. So Jesus turned and said to them, 'Women of
Jerusalem, do not weep for me, but weep for yourselves and for your
children. A time, I tell you, is coming, when it will be said -- "Happy
are the women who are barren, and those who have never borne children or
nursed them!" At that time people will begin to say to the mountains
"Fall on us," and to the hills "Cover us." If what you see is done while
the tree is green, what will happen when it is dry?' There were two
others also, criminals, led out to be executed with Jesus. When they had
reached the place called "The Skull," there they crucified Jesus and the
criminals, one on the right, and one on the left. Then Jesus said,
'Father, forgive them; they do not know what they are doing.' His
clothes they divided among them by casting lots. Meanwhile the people
stood looking on. Even the leading men said with a sneer, 'He saved
others, let him save himself, if he is God's Christ, his chosen one.'
The soldiers, too, came up in mockery, bringing him common wine, and
saying as they did so, 'If you are the king of the Jews, save yourself.'
Above him were the words --

     "THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS."
 One of the criminals who were hanging beside Jesus railed at him.
'Aren't you the Christ? Save yourself and us,' he said. But the other
rebuked him. 'Haven't you,' he said, 'any fear of God, now that you are
under the same sentence? And we justly so, for we are only reaping our
deserts, but this man has not done anything wrong. Jesus,' he went on,
'do not forget me when you have come to your kingdom.' And Jesus
answered, 'I tell you, this very day you will be with me in Paradise.'
     It was nearly midday, when a darkness came over the whole country,
lasting until three in the afternoon, the sun being eclipsed; and the
Temple curtain was torn down the middle. Then Jesus, with a loud cry,
said, 'Father, into your hands I commit my spirit.' And with these words
he expired. The Roman centurion, on seeing what had happened, praised
God, exclaiming, 'This must have been a good man!' All the people who
had collected to see the sight watched what occurred, and then went home
beating their breasts. All the friends of Jesus had been standing at a
distance, with the women who accompanied him from Galilee, watching all
this.

     Now there was a man of the name of Joseph, who was a member of the
Council, and who bore a good and upright character. (This man had not
assented to the decision and action of the Council.) He belonged to
Arimathea, a town in Judea, and lived in expectation of the kingdom of
God. He now went to see Pilate, and asked for the body of Jesus; and,
when he had taken it down, he wrapped it in a linen sheet, and laid him
in a tomb cut out of stone, in which no one had yet been buried. It was
the Preparation day, and just before the Sabbath began. The women who
had accompanied Jesus from Galilee followed, and saw the tomb and how
the body of Jesus was laid, and then went home, and prepared spices and
perfumes.

*The Risen Life*

     During the Sabbath they rested, as directed by the commandment.
But very early on the first day of the week they went to the tomb,
taking with them the spices that they had prepared. They found that the
stone had been rolled away from the tomb; and, on going into it, they
could not find the body{  (24:3)  Some later manuscripts add: of the
Lord Jesus. }. While they were at a loss to account for this, all at
once two men stood beside them, in dazzling clothing. But, when in their
fear the women bowed their faces to the ground, the men said to them,
'Why are you looking among the dead for him who is living? {  (24:6)
Some later manuscripts add: He is not here but he has risen. } Remember
how he spoke to you before he left Galilee -- How he said that the Son
of Man must be betrayed into the hands of wicked men, and be crucified,
and rise again on the third day.' Then they remembered the words of
Jesus, and, on returning from the tomb, they told all this to the Eleven
and to all the rest. There were Mary of Magdala, and Joanna, and Mary,
the mother of James. The other women, too, spoke about this to the
apostles. What they said seemed to the apostles mere nonsense, and they
did not believe them. {  (24:12)  Some later manuscripts add: Peter got
up and ran to the tomb. Stooping down he saw nothing but the linen
wrappings, and he went away, wondering to himself at what had taken
place. }

     It happened that very day that two of the disciples were going to a
village called Emmaus, which was about seven miles from Jerusalem,
talking together, as they went, about all that had just taken place.
While they were talking about these things and discussing them, Jesus
himself came up and went on their way with them; but their eyes were
blinded so that they could not recognise him. 'What is this that you are
saying to each other as you walk along?' Jesus asked. They stopped, with
sad looks on their faces, and then one of them, whose name was Cleopas,
said to Jesus, 'Are you staying by yourself at Jerusalem, that you have
not heard of the things that have happened there within the last few
days?'
     'What things do you mean?' asked Jesus. 'Why, about Jesus of
Nazareth,' they answered, 'who, in the eyes of God and all the people,
was a prophet, whose power was felt in both his words and actions; and
how the chief priests and our leading men gave him up to be sentenced to
death, and afterwards crucified him. But we were hoping that he was the
Destined Deliverer of Israel; yes, and besides all this, it is now three
days since these things occurred. And what is more, some of the women
among us have greatly astonished us. They went to the tomb at daybreak
And, not finding the body of Jesus there, came and told us that they had
seen a vision of angels who told them that he was alive. So some of our
number went to the tomb and found everything just as the women had said,
but they did not see Jesus.'
     Then Jesus said to them, 'Foolish men, slow to accept all that the
prophets have said! Was not the Christ bound to undergo this suffering
before entering into his glory?' Then, beginning with Moses and all the
prophets, he explained to them all through the scriptures the passages
that referred to himself. When they got near the village to which they
were walking, Jesus appeared to be going further; but they pressed him
not to do so. 'Stay with us,' they said, 'for it is getting towards
evening, and the sun is already low.' So Jesus went in to stay with
them. After he had taken his place at the table with them, he took the
bread and said the blessing, and broke it, and gave it to them. Then
their eyes were opened and they recognised him; but he disappeared from
their sight. 'How our hearts glowed,' the disciples said to each other,
'while he was talking to us on the road, and when he explained the
scriptures to us!'
     Then they immediately got up and returned to Jerusalem, where they
found the Eleven and their companions all together, who told them that
the Master had really risen, and had appeared to Simon. So they also
related what had happened during their walk, and how they had recognised
Jesus at the breaking of the bread. While they were still talking about
these things, Jesus himself stood among them.{  (24:36)  Some later
manuscripts add: and said, 'Peace be with you.' } In their terror and
alarm they thought they saw a ghost, but Jesus said to them, 'Why are
you so startled? And why do doubts arise in your minds? Look at my hands
and my feet, and you will know that it is I. Feel me, and look at me,
for a ghost has not flesh and bones, as you see that I have.' {  (24:40)
Some later manuscripts add: After saying this he showed them his hands
and his feet. } While they were still unable to believe it all, overcome
with joy, and were wondering if it were true, Jesus said to them, 'Have
you anything here to eat?' They handed him a piece of broiled fish, and
he took it and ate it before their eyes. 'This is what I told you,' he
said, 'when I was still with you -- that everything that had been
written about me in the Law of Moses, the prophets, and the Psalms, must
be fulfilled.'
     Then he enabled them to understand the meaning of the scriptures,
saying to them, 'Scripture says that the Christ will suffer, and that he
will rise again from the dead on the third day, and that repentance for
forgiveness of sins will be proclaimed on his authority to all the
nations -- beginning at Jerusalem. You yourselves are to be witnesses to
all this. And now I am myself about to send you that which my Father has
promised. But you must remain in the city until you have been invested
with power from above.'

     After this, Jesus led them out as far as Bethany, and there raised
his hands and blessed them. As he was in the act of blessing them, he
left them.{  (24:51)  Some later manuscripts add: and was carried up
into heaven. } They returned{  (24:52)  Some later manuscripts read:
They bowed to the ground before him and returned. } to Jerusalem full of
joy; and they were constantly in the Temple Courts, blessing God.

                                  THE
                         GOOD NEWS ACCORDING TO
                                  JOHN


*Introduction*



     In the beginning the Word was;
         and the Word was with God;
         and the Word was God.


     He was in the beginning with God;
         through him all things came into being,
         and nothing came into being apart from him.
     That which came into being in him was life;
         and the life was the light of humanity;
         and the light shines in the darkness,
         and the darkness never overpowered it.


     There appeared a man sent from God, whose name was John;
         he came as a witness -- to bear witness to the light
         so that through him everyone might believe.
     He was not the light,
         but he came to bear witness to the light.


     That was the true light which enlightens everyone coming into the
world.
     He was in the world;
         and through him the world came into being --
         yet the world did not know him.


     He came to his own --
         yet his own did not receive him.
     But to all who did receive him he gave power to become children of
God --
         to those who believe in his name.
     For not to natural conception, nor to human instincts, nor to human
will did they owe the new life,
         but to God.


     And the Word became human, and lived among us,
         (We saw his glory -- the glory of the Only Son sent from the
Father),
         full of love and truth.
     (John bears witness to him; he cried aloud -- for it was he who
spoke --
         'He who is coming after me is now before me,
         for he was ever first');
     out of his fullness we have all received
         gift after gift of love;
     for the Law was given through Moses,
         love and truth came through Jesus Christ.
     No one has ever yet seen God;
         God the only Son, who is ever with the Father --
     he has revealed him.


*The Preparation*

     When the religious authorities in Jerusalem sent some Priests and
Levites to ask John -- 'Who are you?', he told them clearly and simply,
'I am not the Christ.'
     'What then?' they asked. 'Are you Elijah?'
     'No,' he said, 'I am not.'
     'Are you "the prophet"?' He answered, 'No.'
     'Who then are you?' they continued. 'Tell us so that we have an
answer to give to those who have sent us. What do you say about
yourself?'
     'I,' he answered, 'am --

     "The voice of one crying aloud in the wilderness: make a straight
road for the Lord",

 as the prophet Isaiah said.'
     These men had been sent from the Pharisees; and their next question
was, 'Why then do you baptise, if you are not the Christ or Elijah or
"the prophet"?' John's answer was -- 'I baptise with water, but among
you stands one whom you do not know; he is coming after me, yet I am not
worthy even to unfasten his sandal.' This happened at Bethany, across
the Jordan, where John was baptising.
     The next day John saw Jesus coming towards him, and exclaimed,
'Here is the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world! I was
talking about him when I said "After me there is coming a man who ranks
ahead of me, because before I was born he already was." I did not know
who he was, but I have come baptising with water to make him known to
Israel.' John also said:
    'I saw the Spirit come down from heaven like a dove and rest on him.
I myself did not know him, but he who sent me to baptise with water, he
said to me "He on whom you see the Spirit descending, and remaining on
him -- he it is who baptises with the Holy Spirit." This I have seen
myself, and I have declared my belief that he is the Son of God.'

     The next day, when John was standing with two of his disciples, he
looked at Jesus as he passed and exclaimed, 'There is the Lamb of God!'
The two disciples heard him say this, and followed Jesus. But Jesus
turned round, and saw them following. 'What are you looking for?' he
asked. 'Rabbi,' they answered (or, as we should say, "Teacher"), 'where
are you staying?'
     'Come, and you will see,' he replied. So they went, and saw where
he was staying, and spent that day with him.
     It was then about four in the afternoon. One of the two, who heard
what John said and followed Jesus, was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother. He
first found his own brother Simon, and said to him, 'We have found the
Messiah!' (a word which means "Christ," or "Consecrated".) Then he
brought him to Jesus. Looking straight at him, Jesus said, 'You are
Simon, the son of John; you will be called Cephas' (which means "Peter,"
or "Rock"). The following day Jesus decided to leave for Galilee. He
found Philip, and said to him, 'Follow me.' Philip was from Bethsaida,
the same town as Andrew and Peter. He found Nathanael and said to him,
'We have found him of whom Moses wrote in the Law, and of whom the
prophets also wrote -- Jesus of Nazareth, Joseph's son!'
     'Can anything good come out of Nazareth?' asked Nathanael. 'Come
and see,' replied Philip. When Jesus saw Nathanael coming towards him,
he said, 'Here is a true Israelite, in whom there is no deceit!'
     'How do you know me?' asked Nathanael. 'Even before Philip called
you,' replied Jesus, 'when you were under the fig tree, I saw you.'
     'Rabbi,' Nathanael exclaimed, 'you are the Son of God, you are king
of Israel!'
     'Do you believe in me,' asked Jesus, 'because I told you that I saw
you under the fig tree? You will see greater things than those! In truth
I tell you,' he added, 'you will all see heaven open, and the angels of
God ascending and descending on the Son of Man.'

*The Work in Judaea, Galilee and Samaria*

     Two days after this there was a wedding at Cana in Galilee, and
Jesus' mother was there. Jesus himself, too, with his disciples, was
invited to the wedding. And, when the wine ran short, his mother said to
him, 'They have no wine left.'
     'What do you want with me?' answered Jesus. 'My time has not come
yet.' His mother said to the servants, 'Do whatever he tells you.' There
were standing there six stone water-jars, in accordance with the Jewish
rule of purification, each holding twenty or thirty gallons.
     Jesus said to the servants, 'Fill the water-jars with water.' And,
when they had filled them to the brim, he added, 'Now take some out, and
carry it to the Master of the feast.' The servants did so. And, when the
Master of the feast had tasted the water which had now become wine, not
knowing where it had come from -- although the servants who had taken
out the water knew -- He called the groom and said to him, 'Everyone
puts good wine on the table first, and inferior wine afterwards, when
his guests have drunk freely; but you have kept back the good wine until
now!' This, the first sign of his mission, Jesus gave at Cana in
Galilee, and by it revealed his glory; and his disciples believed in
him.

     After this, Jesus went down to Capernaum -- he, his mother, his
brothers, and his disciples; but they stayed there only a few days.

     Then, as the Jewish Passover was near, Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
In the Temple Courts he found people who were selling bullocks, sheep,
and pigeons, and the money changers at their counters. So he made a whip
of cords, and drove them all out of the Temple Courts, and the sheep and
bullocks as well; he scattered the money of the money changers, and
overturned their tables, and said to the pigeon-dealers, 'Take these
things away. Do not turn my Father's house into a market house.' His
disciples remembered that scripture said -- "Passion for your house will
consume me."
     Then some of the religious authorities asked Jesus, 'What sign are
you going to show us, since you act in this way?'
     'Destroy this temple,' was his answer, 'and I will raise it in
three days.'
     'This Temple,' the authorities replied, 'has been forty-six years
in building, and are you going to "raise it in three days"?' But Jesus
was speaking of his body as a temple. Afterwards, when he had risen from
the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this; and they
believed the passage of scripture, and the words which Jesus had spoken.

     While Jesus was in Jerusalem, during the Passover Festival, many
came to trust in him, when they saw the signs of his mission that he was
giving. But Jesus did not put himself in their power because he knew
what was in their hearts. He did not need anyone to tell him about
people because he could read what was in them.

     Now there was a Pharisee named Nicodemus, who was a leading man
among his people. This man came to Jesus by night, and said to him,
'Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher come from God; for no one could
give such signs as you are giving, unless God were with him.'
     'In truth I tell you,' exclaimed Jesus, 'unless a person is reborn,
they cannot see the kingdom of God.'
     'How can a person,' asked Nicodemus, 'be born when they are old?
Can they be born a second time?'
     'In truth I tell you,' answered Jesus, 'unless a person owes their
birth to water and Spirit, they cannot enter the kingdom of God. All
that owes its birth to human nature is human, and all that owes its
birth to the Spirit is spiritual. Do not wonder at my telling you that
you all need to be reborn. The wind blows wherever it wants, and you can
hear the sound it makes, but you do not know where it comes from, or
where it goes; it is the same with everyone who owes his birth to the
Spirit.'
     'How can that be?' asked Nicodemus. 'What! You a teacher of
Israel,' exclaimed Jesus, 'and yet do not understand this! In truth I
tell you that we speak of what we know, and state what we have seen; and
yet you do not accept our statements. If, when I tell you earthly
things, you do not believe me, how will you believe me when I tell you
of heavenly things? No one has ascended to heaven, except him who
descended from heaven -- the Son of Man himself. And, as Moses lifted up
the snake in the desert, so must the Son of Man be lifted up; so that
everyone who believes in him may have eternal life.'
     For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, so that
everyone who believes in him may not be lost, but have eternal life. For
God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but so
that the world might be saved through him. The person who believes in
him escapes condemnation, while the person who does not believe in him
is already condemned, because they have not believed in the only Son of
God. The ground of their condemnation is this, that though the light has
come into the world, people preferred the darkness to the light, because
their actions were wicked. For the person who lives an evil life hates
the light, and will not come to it, fearing that their actions will be
exposed; but the person who lives by the truth comes into the light, so
it can be clearly seen that God is in all they do.

     After this, Jesus went with his disciples into the country parts of
Judea; and there he stayed with them, and baptised. John, also, was
baptising at Aenon near Salim, because there were many streams there;
and people were constantly coming and being baptised. (For John had not
yet been imprisoned). Now a discussion arose between some of John's
disciples and a fellow Jew on the subject of purification; and the
disciples came to John and said, 'Rabbi, the man who was with you on the
other side of the Jordan, and to whom you have yourself borne testimony
-- he, also, is baptising, and everybody is going to him.' John's answer
was -- 'A person can gain nothing but what is given them from heaven.
You are yourselves witnesses that I said "I am not the Christ," but "I
have been sent before him as a messenger." It is the groom who has the
bride; but the groom's friend, who stands by and listens to him, is
filled with joy when he hears the groom's voice. This joy I have felt to
the full. He must become greater, and I less.'
     He who comes from above is above all others; but a child of earth
is earthly, and his teaching is earthly, too. He who comes from heaven
is above all others. He states what he has seen and what he heard, and
yet no one accepts his statement. They who did accept his statement
confirm the fact that God is true. For he whom God sent as his messenger
gives us God's own teaching, for God does not limit the gift of the
Spirit. The Father loves his Son, and has put everything in his hands.
The person who believes in the Son has eternal life, while a person who
rejects the Son will not even see that life, but remains under God's
displeasure.

     Now, when the Master heard that the Pharisees had been told that he
was making and baptising more disciples than John (Though it was not
Jesus himself, but his disciples, who baptised), he left Judea, and set
out again for Galilee. He had to pass through Samaria, and, on his way,
he came to a Samaritan town called Shechem, near the plot of land that
Jacob gave to his son Joseph. Jacob's Spring was there, and Jesus, being
tired after his journey, sat down beside the spring, just as he was. It
was then about midday. A woman of Samaria came to draw water; and Jesus
said to her -- 'Give me some to drink,' For his disciples had gone into
the town to buy food. 'How is it,' replied the Samaritan woman, 'that
you who are a Jew ask for water from a Samaritan woman like me?' (For
Jews do not associate with Samaritans). 'If you knew of the gift of
God,' replied Jesus, 'and who it is that is saying to you "Give me some
water," you would have asked him, and he would have given you living
water.'
     'You have no bucket, Sir, and the well is deep,' she said. 'Where
did you get that "living water?" Surely you are not greater than our
ancestor Jacob who gave us the well, and used to drink from it himself,
and his sons, and his cattle!'
     'All who drink of this water,' replied Jesus, 'will be thirsty
again; but whoever once drinks of the water that I will give him will
never thirst any more; but the water that I will give him will become a
spring welling up within him -- a source of eternal life.'
     'Give me this water, Sir,' said the woman, 'so that I may not be
thirsty, nor have to come all the way here to draw water.'
     'Go and call your husband,' said Jesus, 'and then come back.'
     'I have no husband,' answered the woman. 'You are right in saying
"I have no husband,"' replied Jesus, 'For you have had five husbands,
and the man with whom you are now living is not your husband; in saying
that, you have spoken the truth.'
     'I see, Sir, that you are a prophet!' exclaimed the woman. 'It was
on this mountain that our ancestors worshiped; and yet you Jews say that
the proper place for worship is in Jerusalem.'
     'Believe me,' replied Jesus, 'a time is coming when it will be
neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem that you will worship the
Father. You Samaritans do not know what you worship; we know what we
worship, for salvation comes from the Jews. But a time is coming, indeed
it is already here, when the true worshipers will worship the Father
spiritually and truly; for such are the worshipers that the Father
desires. God is Spirit; and those who worship him must worship
spiritually and truly.'
     'I know,' answered the woman, 'that the Messiah, who is called the
Christ, is coming; when once he has come, he will tell us everything.'
     'I am he,' Jesus said to her, 'I who am speaking to you.' At this
moment his disciples came up, and were surprised to find him talking
with a woman; but none of them asked "What do you want?" or "Why are you
talking with her?" So the woman, leaving her pitcher, went back to the
town, and said to the people, 'Come and see someone who has told me
everything that I have done. Can he be the Christ?' And the people left
the town and went to see Jesus.
     Meanwhile the disciples kept saying to him, 'Take something to eat,
Rabbi.'
     'I have food to eat,' he answered, 'of which you know nothing.'
     'Can anyone have brought him anything to eat?' the disciples said
to one another. 'My food,' replied Jesus, 'is to do the will of him who
sent me, and to complete his work. Don't you say that it still wants
four months to harvest? Why, look up, and see how white the fields are
for harvest! Already the reaper is receiving wages and gathering in
sheaves for eternal life, so that sower and reaper rejoice together. For
here the proverb holds good -- "One sows, another reaps." I have sent
you to reap that on which you have spent no labour; others have
laboured, and you have reaped the results of their labour.'
     Many from that town came to believe in Jesus -- Samaritans though
they were -- because the woman had said, "He has told me everything that
I have done." And, when these Samaritans had come to Jesus, they begged
him to stay with them, and he stayed there two days. But far more came
to believe in him because of what he said himself, and they said to the
woman, 'It is no longer because of what you say that we believe in him,
for we have heard him ourselves and know that he really is the Saviour
of the world.'

     After these two days Jesus went on to Galilee; for he himself
declared that "a prophet is not honoured in his own country." When he
entered Galilee, the Galileans welcomed him, for they had seen all that
he did at Jerusalem during the Festival, at which they also had been
present. So Jesus came again to Cana in Galilee, where he had turned the
water into wine. Now there was one of the king's officers whose son was
lying ill at Capernaum. When this man heard that Jesus had returned from
Judea to Galilee, he went to him, and begged him to come down and cure
his son; for he was at the point of death. Jesus answered, 'Unless you
all see signs and wonders, you will not believe.'
     'Sir,' said the officer, 'come down before my child dies.' And
Jesus answered, 'Go, your son is living.' The man believed what Jesus
said to him, and went; and, while he was on his way down, his servants
met him, and told him that his child was living. So he asked them at
what time the boy began to get better. 'It was yesterday, about one
o'clock,' they said, 'that the fever left him.' By this the father knew
that it was at the very time when Jesus had said to him "Your son is
living"; and he himself, with all his household, believed in Jesus. This
was the second occasion on which Jesus gave a sign of his mission on
coming from Judea to Galilee.

     Sometime after this there was a Jewish Festival; and Jesus went up
to Jerusalem. There is in Jerusalem, near the sheep-gate, a bath with
five colonnades round it. It is called in Hebrew "Bethesda." In these
colonnades a large number of sick people were lying -- blind, lame, and
crippled. {  (5:4)  Some later manuscripts add: for an angel of the Lord
went down at certain times into the pool, and stirred up the water. The
first person to step in after the stirring of the water was healed of
whatever disease they had. } One man who was there had been crippled for
thirty-eight years. Jesus saw the man lying there, and, finding that he
had been in this state a long time, said to him, 'Do you wish to be
cured?'
     'I have no one, Sir,' the sick man answered, 'to put me into the
bath when there is a troubling of the water, and, while I am getting to
it, someone else steps down before me.'
     'Stand up,' said Jesus, 'take up your mat, and walk.' The man was
cured immediately, and took up his mat and began walking. Now it was the
Sabbath. So the religious authorities said to the man who had been
cured, 'This is the Sabbath; you must not carry your mat.'
     'The man who cured me,' he answered, 'said to me "Take up your mat
and walk."'
     'Who was it,' they asked, 'that said to you "Take up your mat and
walk"?' But the man who had been restored did not know who it was; for
Jesus had moved away, because there was a crowd there. Afterwards Jesus
found the man in the Temple Courts, and said to him, 'You are cured now;
do not sin again, or something worse may happen to you.'
     The man went away, and told the authorities that it was Jesus who
had cured him. And that was why they began to persecute Jesus -- because
he did things of this kind on the Sabbath. But Jesus replied, 'My Father
works to this very hour, and I work also.' This made the authorities all
the more eager to kill him, because not only was he doing away with the
Sabbath, but he actually called God his own Father -- putting himself on
an equality with God.
     So Jesus made this further reply, 'In truth I tell you, the Son can
do nothing of himself; he does only what he sees the Father doing;
whatever the Father does, the Son does also. For the Father loves his
Son, and shows him everything that he is doing; and he will show him
still greater things -- so that you will be filled with wonder. For,
just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, so also the Son
gives life to whom he pleases. The Father himself does not judge any
one, but has entrusted the work of judging entirely to his Son, so that
everyone may honour the Son, just as they honour the Father. The person
who does not honour the Son fails to honour the Father who sent him. In
truth I tell you that the person who listens to my message and believes
him who sent me, has eternal life, and does not come under condemnation,
but has already passed out of death into life. In truth I tell you that
a time is coming, indeed it is already here, when the dead will listen
to the voice of the Son of God, and when those who listen will live.
For, just as the Father has inherent life within him, so also he has
granted to the Son to have inherent life within him; and, because he is
Son of Man, he has also given him authority to act as judge. Do not
wonder at this; for the time is coming when all who are in their graves
will hear his voice, and will come out -- those who have done good
rising to life, and those who have lived evil lives rising for
condemnation. I can do nothing of myself; I judge as I am taught; and
the judgment that I give is just, because my aim is not to do my own
will, but the will of him who sent me.
     'If I bear testimony to myself, my testimony is not trustworthy; it
is another who bears testimony to me, and I know that the testimony
which he bears to me is trustworthy. You have yourselves sent to John,
and he has testified to the truth. But the testimony which I receive is
not from people; I am saying this for your salvation. He was the Lamp
that was burning and shining, and you were ready to rejoice, for a time,
in his light. But the testimony which I have is of greater weight than
John's; for the work that the Father has given me to carry out -- the
work that I am doing -- is in itself proof that the Father has sent me
as his messenger. The Father who has sent me has himself borne testimony
to me. You have neither listened to his voice, not seen his form; and
you have not taken his message home to your hearts, because you do not
believe him whom he sent as his messenger. You search the scriptures,
because you think that you find in them immortal life; and, though it is
those scriptures that bear testimony to me, you refuse to come to me to
have life.
     'I do not receive honour from people, but I know this of you, that
you have not the love of God in your hearts. I have come in my Father's
name, and you do not receive me; if another comes in his own name, you
will receive him. How can you believe in me, when you receive honour
from one another and do not desire the honour which comes from the only
God? Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father; your accuser is
Moses, on whom you have been resting your hopes. For, had you believed
Moses, you would have believed me, for it was of me that Moses wrote;
but, if you do not believe his writings, how will you believe my
teaching?'

     After this, Jesus crossed the Sea of Galilee -- otherwise called
the Lake of Tiberias. A great crowd of people, however, followed him,
because they saw the signs of his mission in his work among those who
were sick. Jesus went up the hill, and sat down there with his
disciples. It was near the time of the Jewish Festival of the Passover.
Looking up, and noticing that a great crowd was coming towards him,
Jesus said to Philip, 'Where are we to buy bread for these people to
eat?' He said this to test him, for he himself knew what he meant to do.
'Even if we spent a years' wages on bread,' answered Philip, 'it would
not be enough for each of them to have a little.'
     'There is a boy here,' said Andrew, another of his disciples, Simon
Peter's brother, 'Who has five barley loaves and two fish; but what is
that for so many?'
     'Make the people sit down,' said Jesus. It was a grassy spot; so
the people, who numbered about five thousand, sat down, and then Jesus
took the loaves, and, after saying the thanksgiving, distributed them to
those who were sitting down; and the same with the fish, giving the
people as much as they wanted. When they were satisfied, Jesus said to
his disciples, 'Collect the broken pieces that are left, so that nothing
may be wasted.' The disciples did so, and filled twelve baskets with the
pieces of the five barley loaves, which were left after all had eaten.
     When the people saw the signs which Jesus gave, they said, 'This is
certainly the prophet who was to come into the world.' But Jesus, having
discovered that they were intending to come and carry him off to make
him king, went again up the hill, quite alone.
     When evening fell, his disciples went down to the sea, and, getting
into a boat, began to cross to Capernaum. By this time darkness had set
in, and Jesus had not yet come back to them; the sea, too, was getting
rough, for a strong wind was blowing. When they had rowed three or four
miles, they caught sight of him walking on the water and approaching the
boat, and they were frightened. But Jesus said to them, 'It is I; do not
be afraid!' And after this they were glad to take him into the boat; and
the boat at once arrived off the shore, for which they had been making.

     The people who remained on the other side of the sea had seen that
only one boat had been there, and that Jesus had not gone into it with
his disciples, but that they had left without him. Some boats, however,
had come from Tiberias, from near the spot where they had eaten the
bread after the Master had said the thanksgiving. So, on the next day,
when the people saw that Jesus was not there, or his disciples either,
they themselves got into the boats, and went to Capernaum to look for
him. And, when they found him on the other side of the sea, they said,
'When did you get here, Rabbi?'
     'In truth I tell you,' answered Jesus, 'it is not because of the
signs which you saw that you are looking for me, but because you had the
bread to eat and were satisfied. Work, not for the food that perishes,
but for the food that lasts for eternal life, which the Son of Man will
give you; for on him the Father -- God himself -- has set the seal of
his approval.'
     'How,' they asked, 'are we to do the work that God wants us to do?'
     'The work that God wants you to do,' answered Jesus, 'is to believe
in him whom God sent as his messenger.'
     'What sign, then,' they asked, 'are you giving, which we may see,
and so believe you? What is the work that you are doing? Our ancestors
had the manna to eat in the desert; as scripture says -- "He gave them
bread from heaven to eat."'
     'In truth I tell you,' replied Jesus, 'Moses did not give you the
bread from heaven, but my Father does give you the true bread from
heaven; for the bread that God gives is that which comes down from
heaven, and gives life to the world.'
     'Master,' they exclaimed, 'give us that bread always!'
     'I am the life-giving bread,' Jesus said to them, 'whoever comes to
me will never be hungry, and whoever believes in me will never thirst
again. But, as I have said already, you have seen me, and yet you do not
believe in me. All those whom the Father gives me will come to me; and
no one who comes to me will I ever turn away. For I have come down from
heaven, to do, not my own will, but the will of him who sent me; and his
will is this -- that I should not lose one of all those whom he has
given me, but should raise them up at the Last day. For it is the will
of my Father that everyone who sees the Son, and believes in him, should
have immortal life; and I myself will raise him up at the Last day.'
     The people began murmuring against Jesus for saying -- "I am the
bread which came down from heaven." 'Is not this Jesus, Joseph's son,'
they asked, 'whose father and mother we know? How is it that he now says
that he has come down from heaven?'
     'Do not murmur among yourselves,' said Jesus in reply. 'No one can
come to me, unless the Father who sent me draws him to me; and I will
raise him up at the Last day. It is said in the prophets -- "And they
will all be taught by God." Everyone who is taught by the Father and
learns from him comes to me. Not that anyone has seen the Father, except
him who is from God -- he has seen the Father. In truth I tell you, the
person who believes in me has eternal life. I am the life-giving bread.
Your ancestors ate the manna in the desert, and yet died. The bread that
comes down from heaven is such that whoever eats of it will never die. I
am the living bread that has come down from heaven. If anyone eats of
this bread, they will live for ever; and the bread that I will give is
my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.'
     They began disputing with one another, 'How is it possible for this
man to give us his flesh to eat?'
     'In truth I tell you,' answered Jesus, 'unless you eat the flesh of
the Son of Man, and drink his blood, you have not life within you.
Everyone who takes my flesh for their food, and drinks my blood, has
eternal life; and I will raise them up at the Last day. For my flesh is
true food, and my blood true drink. Everyone who takes my flesh for
their food, and drinks my blood, remains united to me, and I to them. As
the living Father sent me as his messenger, and as I live because the
Father lives, so the person who takes me for their food will live
because I live. That is the bread which has come down from heaven -- not
such as your ancestors ate, and yet died; the person who takes this
bread for their food will live for ever.'
     All this Jesus said in a synagogue, when he was teaching in
Capernaum. On hearing it, many of his disciples said, 'This is harsh
doctrine! Who can bear to listen to it?' But Jesus, aware that his
disciples were murmuring about it, said to them, 'Is this a hindrance to
you? What, then, if you should see the Son of Man ascending where he was
before? It is the Spirit that gives life; human strength achieves
nothing. In the teaching that I have been giving you there is Spirit and
there is life. Yet there are some of you who do not believe in me.' For
Jesus knew from the first who they were that did not believe in him, and
who it was that would betray him; and he added, 'This is why I told you
that no one can come to me, unless enabled by the Father.' After this
many of his disciples drew back, and did not go about with him any
longer. So Jesus said to the Twelve, 'Do you also wish to leave me?' But
Simon Peter answered, 'Master, to whom would we go? Eternal life is in
your teaching; and we have learned to believe and to know that you are
the Holy One of God.'
     'Didn't I myself choose you to be the Twelve?' replied Jesus, 'and
yet, even of you, one is playing the devil's part.' He meant Judas, the
son of Simon Iscariot, who was about to betray him, though he was one of
the Twelve.

     After this, Jesus went about in Galilee, for he would not do so in
Judea, because the religious authorities (in Jerusalem) were eager to
put him to death. When the Jewish Festival of Tabernacles was near, his
brothers said to him, 'Leave this part of the country, and go into
Judea, so that your disciples, as well as we, may see the work that you
are doing. For no one does a thing privately, if they are seeking to be
widely known. Since you do these things, you should show yourself
publicly to the world.' For even his brothers did not believe in him.
     'My time,' answered Jesus, 'is not come yet, but your time is
always here. The world cannot hate you, but it does hate me, because I
testify that its ways are evil. Go yourselves up to the Festival; I am
not going to this Festival yet, because my time has not yet come.' After
telling them this, he stayed on in Galilee.
     But, when his brothers had gone up to the Festival, Jesus also went
up -- not publicly, but privately. The authorities were looking for him
at the Festival and asking "Where is he?"; and there were many whispers
about him among the people, some saying "He is a good man;" others, "No!
He is leading the people astray." No one, however, spoke freely about
him, because they were afraid of the authorities.

     About the middle of the Festival week, Jesus went up into the
Temple Courts, and began teaching. The authorities were astonished. 'How
has this man got his learning,' they asked, 'when he has never studied?'
So, in reply, Jesus said, 'My teaching is not my own; it is his who sent
me. If anyone has the will to do God's will, they will find out whether
my teaching is from God, or whether I speak on my own authority. The
person who speaks on their own authority seeks honour for themselves;
but the one who seeks the honour of him who sent him is sincere, and
there is nothing false in him. Was not it Moses who gave you the Law?
Yet not one of you obeys it! Why are you seeking to put me to death?'
     'You must be possessed by a demon!' the people exclaimed. 'Who is
seeking to put you to death?'
     'There was one thing I did,' replied Jesus, 'at which you are all
still wondering. But that is why Moses has instituted circumcision among
you -- not, indeed, that it began with him, but with our ancestors --
and that is why you circumcise even on a Sabbath. When a man receives
circumcision on a Sabbath to prevent the Law of Moses from being broken,
how can you be angry with me for making a man sound and well on a
Sabbath? Do not judge by appearances; judge justly.' At this some of the
people of Jerusalem exclaimed, 'Is not this the man who they are seeking
to put to death? Yet here he is, speaking out boldly, and they say
nothing to him! Is it possible that our leading men have really
discovered that he is the Christ? Yet we know where this man is from;
but, when the Christ comes, no one will be able to tell where he is
from.' Therefore, Jesus, as he was teaching in the Temple Courts, raised
his voice and said, 'Yes; you know me and you know where I am from. Yet
I have not come on my own authority, but he who sent me may be trusted;
and him you do not know. I do know him, for it is from him that I have
come, and he sent me as his messenger.' So they sought to arrest him;
but no one touched him, for his time was not come yet. Many of the
people, however, believed in him. 'When the Christ comes,' they said,
'will he give more signs of his mission than this man has given?' The
Pharisees heard the people whispering about him in this way, and so the
chief priests and the Pharisees sent officers to arrest him; at which
Jesus said, 'I will be with you but a little longer, and then I am going
to him who sent me. You will look for me, and you will not find me; and
you will not be able to come where I will be.'
     'Where is this man going,' the people asked one another, 'that we
would not find him? Will he go to our countrymen abroad, and teach
foreigners? What does he mean by saying "You will look for me, and you
will not find me; and you will not be able to come where I will be"?'

     On the last and greatest day of the Festival, Jesus, who was
standing by, exclaimed, 'If anyone is thirsty, they should come to me
and drink. From the heart of those who believe in me will flow, as is
said in scripture, rivers of living water.' (By this he meant the
Spirit, which those who had believed in him were to receive; for the
Spirit had not yet come, because Jesus had not yet been exalted.) Some
of the people, when they heard these words, said, 'This is certainly the
Prophet!'; others said, 'the Christ!'; but some asked, 'What! Does the
Christ come from Galilee? Is not it said in scripture that it is of the
descendants of David, and from Bethlehem, the village to which David
belonged, that the Christ is to come?' So there was a sharp division
among the people because of Jesus. Some of them wanted to arrest him,
and yet no one touched him. When the officers returned to the chief
priests and Pharisees, they were asked, 'Why have you not brought him?'
     'No one ever spoke as he speaks!' they answered. 'What! Have you
been led astray too?' the Pharisees replied. 'Have any of our leading
men believed in him, or any of the Pharisees? As for these people who do
not know the Law -- they are cursed!' But one of their number,
Nicodemus, who before this had been to see Jesus, said to them, 'Does
our Law pass judgment on a person without first giving them a hearing,
and finding out what they have been doing?'
     'Are you also from Galilee?' they retorted. 'Search, and you will
find that no prophet is to arise in Galilee!'

     And everyone went home  except Jesus, who went to the Mount of
Olives{  (8:1)  This passage is inserted in some manuscripts from an
ancient source, and found either after John 7:53 or after Luke 21:38 or
elsewhere. }. But he went again into the Temple Courts early in the
morning, and all the people came to him; and he sat down and taught
them. Presently, however, the Teachers of the Law and the Pharisees
brought a woman who had been caught in adultery, and placed her in the
middle of the Court, and said to Jesus, 'Teacher, this woman was found
in the act of adultery. Now Moses, in the Law, commanded us to stone
such women to death; what do you say?'
     They said this to test him, in order to have a charge to bring
against him. But Jesus stooped down, and wrote on the ground with his
finger. However, as they continued asking him, he raised himself, and
said, 'Let the person among you who has never done wrong throw the first
stone at her.'
     And again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground. When they heard
that, they went out one by one, beginning with the eldest; and Jesus was
left alone with the woman in the middle of the Court. Raising himself,
Jesus said to her, 'Woman, where are they? Did no one condemn you?'
     'No one, Sir,' she answered.
     'Neither do I condemn you,' said Jesus 'go, and do not sin again.'

     Jesus again addressed the people. 'I am the light of the world,' he
said. 'The person who follows me will not walk in darkness, but will
have the light of life.'
     'You are bearing testimony to yourself!' exclaimed the Pharisees,
'your testimony is not trustworthy.'
     'Even if I bear testimony to myself,' answered Jesus, 'my testimony
is trustworthy; for I know where I came from, and where I am going; but
you do not know where I come from, nor where I am going. You judge by
appearances; I judge no one. Yet, even if I were to judge, my judgment
would be trustworthy; because I am not alone, but the Father who sent me
is with me. Why, in your own Law it is said that the testimony of two
persons is trustworthy. I, who bear testimony to myself, am one, and the
Father who sent me also bears testimony to me.' 'Where is your father,
then?' they asked. 'You know neither me nor my Father,' replied Jesus.
'If you had known me, you would have also known my Father.' These
statements Jesus made in the Treasury, while teaching in the Temple
Courts. Yet no one arrested him, for his time had not then come.

     Jesus again spoke to the people. 'I am going away,' he said, 'and
you will look for me, but you will die in your sin; you cannot come
where I am going.'
     'Is he going to kill himself,' the people exclaimed, 'that he says
-- "You cannot go where I am going"?' 'You,' added Jesus, 'are from
below, I am from above; you are of this present world, I am not; and so
I told you that you would die in your sins, for, unless you believe that
I am what I am, you will die in your sins.'
     'Who are you?' they asked. 'Why ask exactly what I have been
telling you?' said Jesus. 'I have still much that concerns you to speak
of and to pass judgment on; yet he who sent me may be trusted, and I
speak to the world only of the things which I have heard from him.' They
did not understand that he meant the Father. So Jesus added, 'When you
have lifted up the Son of Man, then you will understand that I am what I
am, and that I do nothing of myself, but that I say just what the Father
has taught me. Moreover, he who sent me is with me; he has not left me
alone; for I always do what pleases him.' While he was speaking in this
way, many came to believe in him. So Jesus went on to say to those who
had believed him, 'If you remain constant to my message, you are truly
my disciples; and you will find out the truth, and the truth will set
you free.'
     'We are descendants of Abraham,' was their answer, 'and have never
yet been in slavery to anyone. What do you mean by saying "you will be
set free"?' 'In truth I tell you,' replied Jesus, 'everyone who sins is
a slave to sin. And a slave does not remain in the home always; but a
son remains always. If, then, the Son sets you free, you will be free
indeed! I know that you are descendants of Abraham; yet you are seeking
to put me to death, because my message finds no place in your hearts. I
tell you what I have myself seen in the presence of my Father; and you,
in the same way, do what you have learned from your father.'
     'Our father is Abraham,' was their answer. 'If you are Abraham's
children,' replied Jesus, 'do what Abraham did. But, as it is, you are
seeking to put me to death -- a man who has told you the truth as he
heard it from God. Abraham did not act in that way. You are doing what
your own father does.'
     'We are not bastards,' they said, 'we have one Father -- God
himself.'
     'If God were your Father,' Jesus replied, 'you would have loved me,
for I came out from God, and now am here; and I have not come of myself,
but he sent me as his messenger. How is it that you do not understand
what I say? It is because you cannot bear to listen to my message. As
for you, you are children of your father the devil, and you are
determined to do what your father loves to do. He was a murderer from
the first, and did not stand by the truth, because there is no truth in
him. Whenever he lies, he does what is natural to him; because he is a
liar, and the father of lying. But, as for me, it is because I speak the
truth to you that you do not believe me. Which of you can convict me of
sin? Why then don't you believe me, if I am speaking truth? The person
who comes from God listens to God's teaching; the reason why you do not
listen is because you do not come from God.'
     'Aren't we right, after all,' replied the people, 'in saying that
you are a Samaritan, and are possessed by a demon?'
     'I am not possessed by a demon,' Jesus answered, 'but I am
honouring my Father; and yet you dishonour me. Not that I am seeking
honour for myself; there is one who is seeking my honour, and he
decides. In truth I tell you, if anyone lays my message to heart, he
will never really die.'
     'Now we are sure that you are possessed by a demon,' the people
replied. 'Abraham died, and so did the prophets; and yet you say "If
anyone lays my message to heart, they will never know death." Are you
greater than our ancestor Abraham, who died? And the prophets died too.
Whom do you make yourself out to be?'
     'If I do honour to myself,' answered Jesus, 'such honour counts for
nothing. It is my Father who does me honour -- and you say that he is
your God; and yet you have not learned to know him; but I know him; and,
if I were to say that I do not know him, I should be a liar like you;
but I do know him, and I lay his message to heart. Your ancestor Abraham
rejoiced that he would see my day; and he did see it, and was glad.'
     'You are not fifty years old yet,' the people exclaimed, 'and have
you seen Abraham?'
     'In truth I tell you,' replied Jesus, 'before Abraham existed I
was.' At this they took up stones to throw at him; but Jesus hid
himself, and left the Temple Courts.

     As Jesus passed by, he saw a man who had been blind from his birth.
'Rabbi,' asked his disciples, 'who was it that sinned, this man or his
parents, that he was born blind?'
     'Neither the man nor the parents,' replied Jesus, 'but he was born
blind so that the work of God should be made plain in him. We must do
the work of him who sent me, while it is day; night is coming, when no
one can work. As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the
world.' Saying this, Jesus spat on the ground, made some paste with the
saliva, and put it on the man's eyes. 'Go,' he said, 'and wash your eyes
in the Bath of Siloam' (a word which means "messenger"). So the man went
and washed his eyes, and returned able to see. His neighbours, and those
who had formerly known him by sight as a beggar, exclaimed, 'Is not this
the man who used to sit and beg?'
     'Yes,' some said, 'it is'; while others said, 'No, but he is like
him.' The man himself said, 'I am he.'
     'How did you get your sight, then?' they asked. 'The man whom they
call Jesus,' he answered, 'made a paste, and anointed my eyes, and said
to me "Go to Siloam and wash your eyes." So I went and washed my eyes,
and gained my sight.'
     'Where is he?' they asked. 'I do not know,' he answered. They took
the man, who had been blind, to the Pharisees. Now it was a Sabbath when
Jesus made the paste and gave him his sight. So the Pharisees also
questioned the man as to how he had gained his sight. 'He put a paste on
my eyes,' he answered, 'and I washed them, and I can see.'
     'The man cannot be from God,' said some of the Pharisees, 'for he
does not keep the Sabbath.'
     'How is it possible,' retorted others, 'for a bad man to give signs
like this?' So there was a difference of opinion among them, and they
again questioned the man. 'What do you yourself say about him, for it is
to you that he has given sight?' The religious authorities, however,
refused to believe that he had been blind and had gained his sight,
until they had called his parents and questioned them. 'Is this your
son,' they asked, 'who you say was born blind? If so, how is it that he
can see now?'
     'We know that this is our son,' answered the parents, 'and that he
was born blind; but how it is that he can see now we do not know; nor do
we know who it was that gave him his sight. Ask him -- he is old enough
-- he will tell you about himself.' His parents spoke in this way
because they were afraid of the authorities; for the authorities had
already agreed that, if anyone should acknowledge Jesus as the Christ,
he should be expelled from their synagogues. This was why his parents
said "He is old enough; ask him." So the authorities again called the
man who had been blind, and said to him, 'Give God the praise; we know
that this is a bad man.'
     'I know nothing about his being a bad man,' he replied. 'One thing
I do know, that although I was blind, now I can see.'
     'What did he do to you?' they asked. 'How did he give you your
sight?'
     'I told you just now,' he answered, 'and you did not listen. Why do
you want to hear it again? Surely you also do not want to become his
disciples?'
     'You are his disciple,' they retorted scornfully. 'But we are
disciples of Moses. We know that God spoke to Moses; but, as for this
man, we do not know where he comes from.'
     'Well,' the man replied, 'this is very strange; you do not know
where he comes from, and yet he has given me my sight! We know that God
never listens to bad people, but, when a person is god-fearing and does
God's will, God listens to them. Since the world began, such a thing was
never heard of as anyone's giving sight to a person born blind. If this
man had not been from God, he could not have done anything at all.'
     'You,' they retorted, 'were born totally depraved; and are you
trying to teach us?' So they expelled him. Jesus heard of their having
put him out; and, when he had found the man, he asked, 'Do you believe
in the Son of Man?'
     'Tell me who he is, Sir,' he replied, 'so that I may believe in
him.'
     'Not only have you seen him,' said Jesus, 'but it is he who is now
speaking to you.'
     'Then, Sir, I do believe,' said the man, bowing to the ground
before him; and Jesus added, 'It was to put people to the test that I
came into this world, in order that those that cannot see should see,
and that those that can see should become blind.' Hearing this, some of
the Pharisees who were with him said, 'Then are we blind too?'
     'If you had been blind,' replied Jesus, 'you would have had no sin
to answer for; but, as it is, you say "We can see," and so your sin
remains.  In truth I tell you, whoever does not go into the sheepfold
through the door, but climbs up at some other place, that person is a
thief and a robber; but the person who goes in through the door is
shepherd to the sheep. For him the watchman opens the door; and the
sheep listen to his voice; and he calls his own sheep by name, and leads
them out. When he has brought them all out, he walks in front of them,
and his sheep follow him, because they know his voice. They will not
follow a stranger, but will run away from him; because they do not know
a stranger's voice.' This was the allegory that Jesus told them, but
they did not understand of what he was speaking. So he continued, 'In
truth I tell you, I am the door for the sheep. All who came before me
were thieves and robbers; but the sheep did not listen to them. I am the
door; he who goes in through me will be safe, and he will go in and out
and find pasture. The thief comes only to steal, to kill, and to
destroy; I have come so that they may have life, and may have it in
greater fullness. I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down
his life for his sheep. The hired man who is not a shepherd, and who
does not own the sheep, when he sees a wolf coming, leaves them and runs
away; then the wolf seizes them, and scatters the flock. He does this
because he is only a hired man and does not care about the sheep. I am
the good shepherd; and I know my sheep, and my sheep know me -- Just as
the Father knows me and I know the Father -- and I lay down my life for
the sheep. I have other sheep besides, which do not belong to this fold;
I must lead them also, and they will listen to my voice; and they will
become one flock under one shepherd. This is why the Father loves me,
because I lay down my life -- to receive it again. No one took it from
me, but I lay it down of myself. I have authority to lay it down, and I
have authority to receive it again. This is the command which I received
from my Father.'
     In consequence of these words a difference of opinion again arose
among the people. Many of them said, 'He is possessed by a demon and is
mad; why do you listen to him?' Others said, 'This is not the teaching
of one who is possessed by a demon. Can a demon give sight to the
blind?'

     Soon after this the Festival of the Rededication was held at
Jerusalem. It was winter; and Jesus was walking in the Temple Courts, in
the Colonnade of Solomon, when the people gathered round him, and said,
'How long are you going to keep us in suspense? If you are the Christ,
tell us so frankly.'
     'I have told you so,' replied Jesus, 'and you do not believe me.
The work that I am doing in my Father's name bears testimony to me. But
you do not believe me, because you are not of my flock. My sheep listen
to my voice; I know them, and they follow me; and I give them eternal
life, and they will not be lost; nor will anyone snatch them out of my
hands. What my Father has entrusted to me is more than all else; and no
one can snatch anything out of the Father's hands. The Father and I are
one.'
     Some of the people again brought stones to throw at him; and seeing
this, Jesus said, 'I have done before your eyes many good actions,
inspired by the Father; for which of them would you stone me?'
     'It is not for any good action that we would stone you,' they
answered, 'but for blasphemy; and because you, who are only a man, make
yourself out to be God.'
     'Are there not,' replied Jesus, 'these words in your Law -- "I
said, You are gods"? If those to whom God's word were addressed were
said to be "gods" -- and scripture cannot be set aside -- do you say of
one whom the Father has consecrated and sent as his messenger to the
world "You are blaspheming," because I said "I am God's Son"? If I am
not doing the work that my Father is doing, do not believe me; if I am
doing it, even though you do not believe me, believe what that work
shows; so that you may understand, and understand more and more clearly,
that the Father is in union with me, and I with the Father.' The
authorities again sought to arrest him; but he escaped their hands.

     Then Jesus again crossed the Jordan to the place where John used to
baptise at first, and stayed there some time, during which many people
came to see him. 'John gave no sign of his mission,' they said. 'But
everything that he said about this man was true.' And many learned to
believe in Jesus there.

     Now a man named Lazarus, of Bethany, was lying ill; he belonged to
the same village as Mary and her sister Martha. This Mary, whose brother
Lazarus was ill, was the Mary who anointed the Master with perfume, and
wiped his feet with her hair. The sisters, therefore, sent this message
to Jesus -- "Master, your friend is ill"; and, when Jesus heard it, he
said, 'This illness is not to end in death, but is to redound to the
honour of God, in order that the Son of God may be honoured through it.'
Jesus loved Martha and her sister, and Lazarus. Yet, when he heard of
the illness of Lazarus, he still stayed two days in the place where he
was. Then, after that, he said to his disciples, 'Let us go to Judea
again.'
     'Rabbi,' they replied, 'the authorities there were but just now
seeking to stone you; and are you going there again?'
     'Are not there twelve hours in the day?' answered Jesus. 'If
someone walks about in the daytime, they don't stumble, because they can
see the light of the sun; but, if they walk about at night, they
stumble, because they have not the light.' And, when he had said this,
he added, 'Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep; but I am going so that
I may wake him.'
     'If he has fallen asleep, Master, he will get well,' said the
disciples. But Jesus meant that he was dead; they, however, supposed
that he was speaking of natural sleep. Then he said to them plainly,
'Lazarus is dead; and I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, so
that you may learn to believe in me. But let us go to him.' At this,
Thomas, who was called "The Twin," said to his fellow disciples, 'Let us
go too, so that we may die with him.' When Jesus reached the place, he
found that Lazarus had been four days in the tomb already. Bethany being
only about two miles from Jerusalem, a number of the people had come
there to comfort Martha and Mary because of their brother's death. When
Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went to meet him; but Mary sat
quietly at home. 'Master,' Martha said to Jesus, 'if you had been here,
my brother would not have died. Even now, I know that God will grant you
whatever you ask him.'
     'Your brother will rise to life,' said Jesus. 'I know that he
will,' replied Martha, 'in the resurrection at the Last day.'
     'I am the resurrection and the life,' said Jesus. 'He who believes
in me will live, though he die; and he who lives and believes in me will
never die. Do you believe this?'
     'Yes Master,' she answered. 'I have learned to believe that you are
the Christ, the Son of God, who was to come into the world.' After
saying this, Martha went and called her sister Mary, and whispered, 'The
teacher is here, and is asking for you.' As soon as Mary heard that, she
got up quickly, and went to meet him. Jesus had not then come into the
village, but was still at the place where Martha had met him. So the
people, who were in the house with Mary, comforting her, when they saw
her get up quickly and go out, followed her, thinking that she was going
to the tomb to weep there. When Mary came where Jesus was and saw him,
she threw herself at his feet. 'Master,' she exclaimed, 'if you had been
here, my brother would not have died!' When Jesus saw her weeping, and
the people who had come with her weeping also, he groaned deeply, and
was greatly distressed. 'Where have you buried him?' he asked. 'Come and
see, Master,' they answered. Jesus burst into tears. 'How he must have
loved him!' the people exclaimed; but some of them said, 'Could not this
man, who gave sight to the blind man, have also prevented Lazarus from
dying?' Again groaning inwardly, Jesus came to the tomb. It was a cave,
and a stone lay against the mouth of it. 'Move the stone away,' said
Jesus. 'Master,' said Martha, the sister of the dead man, 'by this time
the smell must be offensive, for this is the fourth day since his
death.'
     'Didn't I tell you,' replied Jesus, 'that, if you would believe in
me, you should see the glory of God?' So they moved the stone away; and
Jesus, with uplifted eyes, said, 'Father, I thank you that you have
heard my prayer. I know that you always hear me; but I say this for the
sake of the people standing near, so that they may believe that you have
sent me as your messenger.'
     Then, after saying this, Jesus called in a loud voice, 'Lazarus!
Come out!' The dead man came out, wrapped hand and foot in a winding-
sheet; his face, too, had been wrapped in a cloth. 'Set him free,' said
Jesus, 'and let him go.'

     In consequence of this, many of the people, who had come to visit
Mary and had seen what Jesus did, put their faith in him. Some of them,
however, went to the Pharisees, and told them what he had done. The
chief priests and the Pharisees called a meeting of the High Council,
and said, 'What are we to do, now that this man is giving so many signs?
If we allow him to continue as we are doing, everyone will believe in
him; and the Romans will come and will take from us both our Temple and
our nation.' One of them, however, Caiaphas, who was high priest that
year, said to them, 'You are utterly mistaken. You do not consider that
it is better for you that one person should die for the people, rather
than the whole nation should be destroyed.' Now he did not say this of
his own accord; but, as high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus
was to die for the nation -- And not for the nation only, but also that
he might unite in one body the children of God now scattered far and
wide. So from that day they plotted to put Jesus to death.

     In consequence of this, Jesus did not go about publicly among the
people any more, but left and went into the country bordering on the
wilderness, to a town called Ephraim, where he stayed with his
disciples. But the Jewish Festival of the Passover was near; and many
people had gone up from the country to Jerusalem, for their
purification, before the Festival began. So they looked for Jesus there,
and said to one another, as they stood in the Temple Courts, 'What do
you think? Do you think he will come to the Festival?' The chief priests
and the Pharisees had already issued orders that, if anyone learned
where Jesus was, he should give information, so that they might arrest
him.

*The Last Days*

     Six days before the Passover Jesus came to Bethany, where Lazarus,
whom he had raised from the dead, was living. There a supper was given
in his honour at which Martha waited, while Lazarus was one of those
present at the table. So Mary took a pound of choice spikenard perfume
of great value, and anointed the feet of Jesus with it, and then wiped
them with her hair. The whole house was filled with the scent of the
perfume. One of the disciples, Judas Iscariot, who was about to betray
Jesus, asked, 'Why was not this perfume sold for a year's wages, and the
money given to poor people?' He said this, not because he cared for the
poor, but because he was a thief, and, being in charge of the purse,
used to take what was put in it. 'Leave her alone,' said Jesus, 'so that
she may keep it until the day when my body is being prepared for burial.
The poor you always have with you, but you will not always have me.'
     Now great numbers of people found out that Jesus was at Bethany;
and they came there, not only because of him, but also to see Lazarus,
whom he had raised from the dead. The chief priests, however, plotted to
put Lazarus, as well as Jesus, to death, because it was owing to him
that many of the people had left them, and were becoming believers in
Jesus. On the following day great numbers of people who had come to the
Festival, hearing that Jesus was on his way to Jerusalem, took palm
branches, and went out to meet him, shouting as they went, 'God save
him! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord -- the king of
Israel!' Having found a young donkey, Jesus seated himself on it, in
accordance with the passage of scripture -- "Fear not, people of Zion.
Your king is coming to you, sitting on the foal of a donkey." His
disciples did not understand all this at first; but, when Jesus had been
exalted, then they remembered that these things had been said of him in
scripture, and that they had done these things for him. Meanwhile the
people who were with him, when he called Lazarus out of the tomb and
raised him from the dead, were telling what they had seen. This, indeed,
was why the crowd met him -- because people had heard that he had given
this sign of his mission. So the Pharisees said to one another, 'You see
that you are gaining nothing! Why, all the world has run after him!'

     Among those who were going up to worship at the Festival were some
Greeks, who went to Philip of Bethsaida in Galilee, and said, 'Sir, we
wish to see Jesus.' Philip went and told Andrew, and then together they
went and told Jesus. This was his reply -- 'The time has come for the
Son of Man to be exalted. In truth I tell you, unless a grain of wheat
falls into the ground and dies, it remains solitary; but, if it dies, it
becomes fruitful. A person who loves their life loses it; while someone
who hates their life in the present world will preserve it for eternal
life. If someone is ready to serve me, let them follow me; and where I
am, there my servant will be also. If a person is ready to serve me, my
Father will honour them. Now I am distressed at heart and what can I
say? Father, bring me safe through this hour -- yet it was for this
reason that I came to this hour -- Father, honour your own name.' At
this there came a voice from heaven, which said, 'I have already
honoured it, and I will honour it again.' The crowd of bystanders, who
heard the sound, said that it was thundering. Others said, 'An angel has
been speaking to him.'
     'It was not for my sake that the voice came,' said Jesus, 'but for
yours. Now this world is on its trial. Now the Spirit that is ruling
this world will be driven out; and I, when I am lifted up from the
earth, will draw all people to myself.' By these words he indicated what
death he was destined to die. 'We,' replied the people, 'have learned
from the Law that the Christ is to remain for ever; how is it, then,
that you say that the Son of Man must be "lifted up" Who is this "Son of
Man"?'
     'Only a little while longer,' answered Jesus, 'will you have the
light among you. Travel on while you have the light, so that darkness
may not overtake you; he who travels in the darkness does not know where
he is going. While you still have the light, believe in the light, so
that you may be children of light.' After he had said this, Jesus went
away, and hid himself from them. But, though Jesus had given so many
signs of his mission before their eyes, they still did not believe in
him, in fulfilment of the words of the prophet Isaiah, where he says --
"Lord, who has believed our teaching? And to whom has the might of the
Lord been revealed?" The reason why they were unable to believe is given
by Isaiah elsewhere, in these words -- "He has blinded their eyes, and
blunted their mind, so that they should not see with their eyes, and
perceive with their mind, and turn -- And I should heal them." Isaiah
said this, because he saw Christ's glory; and it was of him that he
spoke. Yet for all this, even among the leading men there were many who
came to believe in Jesus; but, because of the Pharisees, they did not
acknowledge it, because they were afraid that they should be expelled
from their synagogues; for they valued honour from people more than
honour from God. But Jesus had proclaimed, 'He who believes in me
believes, not in me, but in him who sent me; and he who sees me sees him
who sent me. I have come as a light into the world, so that no one who
believes in me should remain in the darkness. When anyone hears my
teaching and pays no heed to it, I am not his judge; for I came not to
judge the world, but to save the world. He who rejects me, and
disregards my teaching, has a judge already -- the message which I have
delivered will itself be his judge at the Last day. For I have not
delivered it on my own authority; but the Father, who sent me, has
himself given me his command as to what I should say, and what message I
should deliver. And I know that eternal life lies in keeping his
command. Therefore, whatever I say, I say only what the Father has
taught me.'
     Before the Passover Festival began, Jesus knew that the time had
come for him to leave the world and go to the Father. He had loved those
who were his own in the world, and he loved them to the last. The devil
had already put the thought of betraying Jesus into the mind of Judas
Iscariot, the son of Simon; and at supper, Jesus -- although knowing
that the Father had put everything into his hands, and that he had come
from God, and was to return to God -- rose from his place, and, taking
off his upper garments, tied a towel round his waist. He then poured
some water into the basin, and began to wash the disciples' feet, and to
wipe them with the towel which was tied round him. When he came to Simon
Peter, Peter said, 'You, Master! Are you going to wash my feet?'
     'You do not understand now what I am doing,' replied Jesus, 'but
you will learn by and by.'
     'You will never wash my feet!' exclaimed Peter. 'Unless I wash
you,' answered Jesus, 'you have nothing in common with me.'
     'Then, Master, not my feet only,' exclaimed Simon Peter, 'but also
my hands and my head.'
     'He who has bathed,' replied Jesus, 'has no need to wash, unless it
be his feet, but is altogether clean; and you,' he said to the
disciples, 'are clean, yet not all of you.' For he knew who was going to
betray him, and that was why he said "You are not all clean." When he
had washed their feet, and had put on his upper garments and taken his
place, he spoke to them again. 'Do you understand what I have been doing
to you?' he asked. 'You yourselves call me "the teacher" and "the
Master", and you are right, for I am both. If I, then -- "the Master"
and "the teacher" -- have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one
another's feet; for I have given you an example, so that you may do just
as I have done to you. In truth I tell you, a servant is not greater
than their master, neither is a messenger greater than the one who sends
them. Now that you know these things, happy are you if you do them. I am
not speaking about all of you. I know whom I have chosen; but this is in
fulfilment of the words of scripture -- "He that is eating my bread has
lifted his heel against me." For the future I will tell you of things
before they take place, so that, when they take place, you may believe
that I am what I am. In truth I tell you, the one who receives anyone
that I send receives me; and the person who receives me receives him who
sent me.' After saying this, Jesus was much troubled, and said solemnly,
'In truth I tell you that it is one of you who will betray me.' The
disciples looked at one another, wondering whom he meant. Next to Jesus,
in the place on his right hand, was one of his disciples, whom he loved.
So Simon Peter made signs to that disciple, and whispered, 'Tell me who
it is that he means.' Being in this position, that disciple leant back
on Jesus' shoulder, and asked him, 'Who is it, Master?'
     'It is the one,' answered Jesus, 'to whom I will give a piece of
bread after dipping it in the dish.' And, when Jesus had dipped the
bread, he took it and gave it to Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot; and
it was then, after he had received it, that Satan took possession of
him. So Jesus said to him, 'Do at once what you are going to do.' But no
one at the table understood why he said this to Judas. Some thought
that, as Judas kept the purse, Jesus meant that he was to buy some
things needed for the Festival, or to give something to the poor. After
taking the piece of bread, Judas went out immediately; and it was night.

     When Judas had gone out, Jesus said, 'Now the Son of Man has been
exalted, and God has been exalted through him; and God will exalt him
with himself -- yes, he will exalt him forthwith. My children, I am to
be with you but a little while longer. You will look for me; and what I
said to the people -- "You cannot come where I am going" -- I now say to
you. I give you a new commandment -- love one another; love one another
as I have loved you. It is by this that everyone will recognise you as
my disciples -- by your loving one another.'
     'Where are you going, Master?' asked Peter. 'I am going where you
cannot now follow me,' answered Jesus, 'but you will follow me later.'
     'Why cannot I follow you now, Master?' asked Peter. 'I will lay
down my life for you.'
     'Will you lay down your life for me?' replied Jesus. 'In truth I
tell you, the cock will not crow until you have disowned me three times.
Do not let your hearts be troubled. Believe in God; believe also in me.
In my Father's home there are many dwellings. If it had not been so, I
should have told you, for I am going to prepare a place for you. And,
since I go and prepare a place for you, I will return and take you to be
with me, so that you may be where I am; and you know the way to the
place where I am going.'
     'We do not know where you are going, Master,' said Thomas. 'So how
can we know the way?' Jesus answered, 'I am the way, and the truth, and
the life; no one ever comes to the Father except through me. If you had
recognised me, you would have known my Father also; for the future you
will recognise him, indeed you have already seen him.'
     'Master, show us the Father,' said Philip, 'and we will be
satisfied.'
     'Have I been all this time among you,' said Jesus, 'and yet you,
Philip, have not recognised me? The person who has seen me has seen the
Father, how can you say, then, "Show us the Father"? Don't you believe
that I am in union with the Father, and the Father with me? In giving
you my teaching I am not speaking on my own authority; but the Father
himself, always in union with me, does his own work. Believe me,' he
said to them all, 'when I say that I am in union with the Father and the
Father with me, or else believe me because of the work itself. In truth
I tell you, the person who believes in me will themselves do the work
that I am doing; and they will do greater work still, because I am going
to the Father. Whatever you ask, in my name, I will do, so that the
Father may be honoured in the Son. If you ask anything, in my name, I
will do it. If you love me, you will lay my commands to heart, and I
will ask the Father, and he will give you another helper, to be with you
always -- the Spirit of truth. The world cannot receive this Spirit,
because it does not see him or recognise him, but you recognise him,
because he is always with you, and is within you. I will not leave you
bereaved; I will come to you. In a little while the world will see me no
more, but you will still see me; because I am living, you will be living
also. At that time you will recognise that I am in union with the
Father, and you with me, and I with you. It is the person who has my
commands and lays them to heart who loves me; and the person who loves
me will be loved by my Father, and I will love them, and will reveal
myself to them.'
     'What has happened, Master,' said Judas (not Judas Iscariot), 'that
you are going to reveal yourself to us, and not to the world?'
     'Whoever loves me,' Jesus answered, 'will lay my message to heart;
and my Father will love him, and we will come to him and make our home
with him. The person who does not love me will not lay my message to
heart; and the message to which you are listening is not my own, but
comes from the Father who sent me. I have told you all this while still
with you, but the helper -- the Holy Spirit whom the Father will send in
my name -- will teach you all things, and will recall to your minds all
that I have said to you. Peace be with you! My own peace I give you. I
do not give to you as the world gives. Do not let your hearts be
troubled, or dismayed. You heard me say that I was going away and would
return to you. Had you loved me, you would have been glad that I was
going to the Father, because the Father is greater than I. And this I
have told you now before it happens, so that, when it does happen, you
may still believe in me. I will not talk with you much more, for the
Spirit that is ruling the world is coming. He has nothing in common with
me; but he is coming so that the world may see that I love the Father,
and that I do as the Father commanded me. Come, let us be going.

     'I am the true vine, and my Father is the vine-grower. Any
unfruitful branch in me he takes away, and he cleanses every fruitful
branch, so that it may bear more fruit. You are already clean because of
the message that I have given you. Remain united to me, and I will
remain united to you. As a branch cannot bear fruit by itself, unless it
remains united to the vine; no more can you, unless you remain united to
me. I am the vine, you are the branches. If you remain united to me,
while I remain united to you -- you bear fruit plentifully; for you can
do nothing apart from me. If anyone does not remain united to me, they
are thrown away, as a branch would be, and withers up. Such branches are
collected and thrown into the fire, and are burnt. If you remain united
to me, and my teaching remains in your hearts, ask whatever you wish,
and it will be yours. It is by your bearing fruit plentifully, and so
showing yourselves my disciples, that my Father is honoured. As the
Father has loved me, so have I loved you; remain in my love. If you lay
my commands to heart, you will remain in my love; just as I have laid
the Father's commands to heart and remain in his love. I have told you
all this so that my own joy may be yours, and that your joy may be
complete. This is my command -- love one another, as I have loved you.
No one can give greater proof of love than by laying down their life for
their friends. And you are my friends, if you do what I command you. I
no longer call you "servants," because a servant does not know what
their master is doing; but I have given you the name of "friends,"
because I made known to you everything that I learned from my Father. It
wasn't you who chose me, but I who chose you, and I appointed you to go
and bear fruit -- fruit that should remain, so that the Father might
grant you whatever you ask in my name. I am giving you these commands
that you may love one another. If the world hates you, you know that it
has first hated me. If you belonged to the world, the world would love
its own. Because you do not belong to the world, but I have chosen you
out of the world -- that is why the world hates you. Remember what I
said to you -- "A servant is not greater than their master." If they
have persecuted me, they will also persecute you; if they have laid my
message to heart, they will lay yours to heart also. But they will do
all this to you, because you believe in my name, for they do not know
him who sent me. If I had not come and spoken to them, they would have
had no sin to answer for; but as it is, they have no excuse for their
sin. The person who hates me hates my Father also. If I had not done
among them such work as no one else ever did, they would have had no sin
to answer for; but, as it is, they have both seen and hated both me and
my Father. And so is fulfilled what is said in their Law -- "They hated
me without cause." But, when the helper comes, whom I will send to you
from the Father -- the Spirit of truth, who comes from the Father --
will bear testimony to me; yes, and you also are to bear testimony,
because you have been with me from the first.  'I have spoken to you in
this way so that you may not falter. They will expel you from their
synagogues; indeed the time is coming when anyone who kills you will
think that they are making an offering to God. They will do this,
because they have not learned to know the Father, or even me. But I have
spoken to you of these things so that, when the time for them comes, you
may remember that I told you about them myself. I did not tell you all
this at first, because I was with you. But now I am to return to him who
sent me; and yet not one of you asks me -- "Where are you going?"
Although your hearts are full of sorrow at all that I have been saying
to you. Yet I am only telling you the truth; it is for your good that I
should go away. For otherwise the helper will never come to you, but, if
I leave you, I will send him to you. And he, when he comes, will bring
conviction to the world as to sin, and as to righteousness, and as to
judgment; as to sin, for people do not believe in me; as to
righteousness, for I am going to the Father, and you will see me no
longer; as to judgment, for the Spirit that is ruling this world has
been condemned. I have still much to say to you, but you cannot bear it
now. Yet when he -- The Spirit of truth -- comes, he will guide you into
all truth; for he will not speak on his own authority, but he will speak
of all that he hears; and he will tell you of the things that are to
come. He will honour me; because he will take of what is mine, and will
tell it to you. Everything that the Father has is mine; that is why I
said that he takes of what is mine, and will tell it to you. In a little
while you will no longer see me; and then in a little while you will see
me indeed.'
     At this some of his disciples said to one another, 'What does he
mean by saying to us "In a little while you will not see me, and then in
a little while you will see me indeed"; and by saying "Because I am
going to the Father"? What does he mean by "In a little while"?' they
said. 'We do not know what he is speaking about.' Jesus saw that they
were wanting to ask him a question, and said, 'Are you trying to find
out from one another what I meant by saying "In a little while you will
not see me; and then in a little while you will see me indeed"? In truth
I tell you that you will weep and mourn, but the world will rejoice; you
will suffer pain, but your pain will turn to joy. A woman in labour is
in pain because her time has come; but no sooner is the child born, than
she forgets her trouble in her joy that a child has been born into the
world. You, in the same way, are sorry now; but I will see you again,
and your hearts will rejoice, and no one will rob you of your joy. And
at that time you will not ask me anything; in truth I tell you, if you
ask the Father for anything, he will grant it to you in my name. So far
you have not asked for anything, in my name; ask, and you will receive,
so that your joy may be complete. I have spoken to you of all this in
figures; a time is coming, however, when I will not speak any longer to
you in figures, but will tell you about the Father plainly. You will
ask, at that time, in my name; and I do not say that I will intercede
with the Father for you; for the Father himself loves you, because you
have loved me, and have believed that I came from the Father. I came out
from the Father, and have come into the world; and now I am to leave the
world, and go to the Father.'
     'At last,' exclaimed the disciples, 'you are using plain words and
not speaking in figures at all. Now we are sure that you know
everything, and need not wait for anyone to question you. This makes us
believe that you did come from God.'
     'Do you believe that already?' Jesus answered. 'Listen! A time is
coming -- indeed it has already come -- when you are to be scattered,
each going his own way, and to leave me alone; and yet I am not alone,
because the Father is with me. I have spoken to you in this way, so that
in me you may find peace. In the world you will find trouble; yet, take
courage! I have conquered the world.'

     After saying this, Jesus raised his eyes heavenwards, and said:

     'Father, the hour has come; honour your Son, so that your Son may
honour you; even as you gave him power over all humanity, so that he
should give eternal life to everyone you have given him. And the eternal
life is this -- to know you the one true God, and Jesus Christ whom you
have sent as your messenger. I have honoured you on earth by completing
the work which you have given me to do; and now do you honour me,
Father, at your own side, with the honour which I had at your side
before the world began. I have revealed you to those whom you gave me
from the world; they were your own, and you gave them to me; and they
have laid your message to heart. They recognise now that everything that
you gave me was from you; for I have given them the teaching which you
gave me, and they received it, and clearly understood that I came from
you, and they believed that you have sent me as your messenger. I
intercede for them; I am not interceding for the world, but for those
whom you have given me, for they are your own -- All that is mine is
yours, and all that is yours is mine -- and I am honoured in them. Now I
am to be in this world no longer, but they are still to be in the world,
and I am to come to you. Holy Father, keep them by that revelation of
your name which you have given me, so that they may be one, as we are.
While I was with them, I kept them by that revelation, and I have
guarded them; and not one of them has been lost, except that lost soul
-- in fulfilment of scripture. But now I am to come to you; and I am
speaking like this, while still in the world, so that they may have my
own joy, in all its fullness, in their hearts. I have given them your
message; and the world hated them, because they do not belong to the
world, even as I do not belong to the world. I do not ask you to take
them out of the world, but to keep them from evil. They do not belong to
the world, even as I do not belong to the world. Consecrate them by the
truth; your message is truth. Just as you have sent me as your messenger
to the world, so I send them as my messengers to the world. And it is
for their sakes that I am consecrating myself, so that they also may be
truly consecrated. But it is not only for them that I am interceding,
but also for those who believe in me through their message, that they
all may be one -- that as you, Father, are in union with us -- and so
the world may believe that you have sent me as your messenger. I have
given them the honour which you have given me, so that they may be one
as we are one -- I in union with them and you with me -- so that they
may be perfected in their union, and so that the world may know that you
have sent me as your messenger, and that you have loved them as you have
loved me. Father, my desire for all those whom you have given me is that
they may be with me where I am, so that they may see the honour which
you have given me; for you did love me before the beginning of the
world. Righteous Father, though the world did not know you, I knew you;
and these people knew that you have sent me as your messenger. I have
made you known to them, and will do so still; that the love that you
have had for me may be in their hearts, and that I may be in them also.'


     When Jesus had said this, he went out with his disciples and
crossed the Kidron ravine to a place where there was a garden, into
which he and his disciples went. The place was well known to Judas, the
betrayer, for Jesus and his disciples had often met there. So Judas, who
had obtained the soldiers of the Roman garrison, and some guards from
the chief priests and the Pharisees, came there with lanterns, torches,
and weapons. Jesus, aware of all that was coming upon him, went to meet
them, and said to them, 'For whom are you looking?'
     'Jesus of Nazareth,' was their answer. 'I am he,' said Jesus.
(Judas, the betrayer, was also standing with them.) When Jesus said "I
am he," they drew back and fell to the ground. So he again asked for
whom they were looking, and they answered, 'Jesus of Nazareth.'
     'I have already told you that I am he,' replied Jesus, 'so, if it
is for me that you are looking, let these people go.' This was in
fulfilment of his words -- "Of those whom you have given me I have not
lost one." At this, Simon Peter, who had a sword with him, drew it, and
struck the high priest's servant, and cut off his right ear. The
servant's name was Malchus. But Jesus said to Peter, 'Sheathe your
sword. Should I not drink the cup which the Father has given me?'
     So the soldiers of the garrison, with their commanding officer and
the Jewish guards, arrested Jesus and bound him, and took him first of
all to Annas. Annas was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, who was high
priest that year. It was Caiaphas who had counselled the religious
authorities, that it was best that one person should die for the people.
Meanwhile Simon Peter followed Jesus, and so did another disciple. That
disciple, being well-known to the high priest, went with Jesus into the
high priest's courtyard, while Peter stood outside by the door.
Presently the other disciple -- the one well-known to the high priest --
went out and spoke to the portress, and brought Peter in. So the
maidservant said to Peter, 'Aren't you also one of this man's
disciples?'
     'No, I am not,' he said. The servants and guards were standing
round a charcoal fire (which they had made because it was cold), and
were warming themselves. Peter, too, was with them, standing and warming
himself. The high priest questioned Jesus about his disciples and about
his teaching. 'For my part,' answered Jesus, 'I have spoken to all the
world openly. I always taught in some synagogue, or in the Temple
Courts, places where everyone assembles, and I never spoke of anything
in secret. Why question me? Question those who have listened to me as to
what I have spoken about to them. They must know what I said.' When
Jesus said this, one of the guards, who was standing near, gave him a
blow with his hand. 'Do you answer the high priest like that?' he
exclaimed. 'If I said anything wrong, give evidence about it,' replied
Jesus, 'but if not, why do you strike me?' Annas sent him bound to
Caiaphas the high priest. Meanwhile Simon Peter was standing there,
warming himself; so they said to him, 'Aren't you also one of his
disciples?' Peter denied it. 'No, I am not,' he said. One of the high
priest's servants, a relation of the man whose ear Peter had cut off,
exclaimed, 'Didn't I myself see you with him in the garden?' Peter again
denied it; and at that moment a cock crowed.

     From Caiaphas they took Jesus to the Government house. It was early
in the morning. But they did not enter the Government house themselves,
otherwise they might become defiled, and so be unable to eat the
Passover. Therefore Pilate came outside to speak to them. 'What charge
do you bring against this man?' he asked. 'If he had not been a
criminal, we should not have given him up to you,' they answered. 'Take
him yourselves,' said Pilate, 'and try him by your own Law.'
     'We have no power to put anyone to death,' the authorities replied
-- in fulfilment of what Jesus had said when indicating the death that
he was destined to die. After that, Pilate went into the Government
house again, and calling Jesus up, asked him, 'Are you the king of the
Jews?'
     'Do you ask me that yourself?' replied Jesus, 'or did others say it
to you about me?'
     'Do you take me for a Jew?' was Pilate's answer. 'It is your own
nation and the chief priests who have given you up to me. What have you
done?'
     'My kingly power,' replied Jesus, 'is not due to this world. If it
had been so, my servants would be doing their utmost to prevent my being
given up to the authorities; but my kingly power is not from the world.'
     'So you are a king after all!' exclaimed Pilate. 'Yes, it is true I
am a king,' answered Jesus. 'I was born for this, I have come into the
world for this -- to bear testimony to the truth. Everyone who is on the
side of truth listens to my voice.'
     'What is truth?' exclaimed Pilate. After saying this, he went out
to the crowd again, and said, 'For my part, I find nothing with which he
can be charged. It is, however, the custom for me to grant you the
release of one man at the Passover Festival. Do you wish for the release
of the king of the Jews?'
     'No, not this man,' they shouted again, 'but Barabbas!' This
Barabbas was a robber.

     After that, Pilate had Jesus scourged. The soldiers made a crown
with some thorns and put it on his head and threw a purple robe round
him. They kept coming up to him and saying, 'Long live the king of the
Jews!' and they gave him blow after blow with their hands. Pilate again
came outside, and said to the people, 'Look! I am bringing him out to
you, so that you may know that I find nothing with which he can be
charged.' Then Jesus came outside, wearing the crown of thorns and the
purple robe; and Pilate said to them, 'Here is the man!' When the chief
priests and the guards saw him, they shouted, 'Crucify him! Crucify
him!'
     'Take him yourselves and crucify him,' said Pilate. 'For my part, I
find nothing with which he can be charged.'
     'But we,' replied the crowd, 'have a Law, under which he deserves
death for making himself out to be the Son of God.' When Pilate heard
what they said, he became still more alarmed; and, going into the
Government house again, he said to Jesus, 'Where do you come from?' But
Jesus made no reply. So Pilate said to him, 'Do you refuse to speak to
me? Don't you know that I have power to release you, and have power to
crucify you?'
     'You would have no power over me at all,' answered Jesus, 'if it
had not been given you from above; and, therefore, the man who betrayed
me to you is guilty of the greater sin.' This made Pilate anxious to
release him; but the crowd shouted, 'If you release that man, you are no
friend of the Emperor! Anyone who makes himself out to be a king is
setting himself against the Emperor!' On hearing what they said, Pilate
brought Jesus out, and took his seat on the Bench at a place called "The
Stone Pavement" -- in Hebrew "Gabbatha." It was the Passover Preparation
day, and about noon. Then he said to the crowd, 'Here is your king!' At
that the people shouted, 'Kill him! Kill him! Crucify him!'
     'What! Should I crucify your king?' exclaimed Pilate. 'We have no
king but the Emperor,' replied the chief priests; so Pilate gave Jesus
up to them to be crucified.

     So they took Jesus; and he went out, carrying his cross himself, to
the place which is named from a skull, or, in Hebrew, Golgotha. There
they crucified him, and two others with him -- one on each side, and
Jesus between them. Pilate also had these words written and put up over
the cross -- "JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS." These words were
read by many people, because the place where Jesus was crucified was
near the city; and they were written in Hebrew, Latin and Greek. The
chief priests said to Pilate, 'Do not write "The king of the Jews", but
write what the man said -- "I am the king of the Jews."' But Pilate
answered, 'What I have written, I have written.'

     When the soldiers had crucified Jesus, they took his clothes and
divided them into four shares -- a share for each soldier -- and they
took the coat also. The coat had no seam, being woven in one piece from
top to bottom. So they said to one another, 'Do not let us tear it, but
let us cast lots for it, to see who will have it.' This was in
fulfilment of the words of scripture --

     "They shared my clothes among them,
         and over my clothing they cast lots."
 That was what the soldiers did. Meanwhile near the cross of Jesus were
standing his mother and his mother's sister, as well as Mary the wife of
Clopas and Mary of Magdala. When Jesus saw his mother, and the disciple
whom he loved, standing near, he said to his mother, 'There is your
son.' Then he said to that disciple, 'There is your mother.' And from
that very hour the disciple took her to live in his house.

     Afterwards, knowing that everything was now finished, Jesus said,
in fulfilment of the words of scripture, 'I am thirsty.' There was a
bowl standing there full of common wine; so they put a sponge soaked in
the wine on the end of a hyssop-stalk, and held it up to his mouth. When
Jesus had received the wine, he exclaimed, 'All is finished!' Then,
bowing his head, he resigned his spirit to God. It was the Preparation
day, and so, to prevent the bodies from remaining on the crosses during
the Sabbath (for that Sabbath was a great day), the Jews asked Pilate to
have the legs broken and the bodies removed. Accordingly the soldiers
came and broke the legs of the first man, and then those of the other
who had been crucified with Jesus; but, on coming to him, when they saw
that he was already dead, they did not break his legs. One of the
soldiers, however, pierced his side with a spear, and blood and water
immediately flowed from it. This is the statement of one who actually
saw it -- and his statement may be relied on, and he knows that he is
speaking the truth -- and it is given in order that you also may be
convinced. For all this happened in fulfilment of the words of scripture
-- "Not one of its bones will be broken." And there is another passage
which says -- "They will look on him whom they pierced." After this,
Joseph of Arimathea, a disciple of Jesus -- but a secret one, owing to
his fear of the religious authorities -- begged Pilate's permission to
remove the body of Jesus. Pilate gave him leave; so Joseph went and
removed the body. Nicodemus, too -- the man who had formerly visited
Jesus by night -- came with a roll of myrrh and aloes, weighing nearly a
hundred pounds. They took the body of Jesus, and wound it in linen with
the spices, according to the Jewish mode of burial. At the place where
Jesus had been crucified there was a garden, and in the garden a newly
made tomb in which no one had ever been laid. And so, because of its
being the Preparation day, and as the tomb was close at hand, they laid
Jesus there.

*The Risen Life*

     On the first day of the week, early in the morning, while it was
still dark, Mary of Magdala went to the tomb, and saw that the stone had
been removed. So she came running to Simon Peter, and to that other
disciple who was Jesus' friend, and said to them, 'They have taken away
the Master out of the tomb, and we do not know where they have laid
him!' So, Peter started off with that other disciple, and they went to
the tomb. The two began running together; but the other disciple ran
faster than Peter, and reached the tomb first. Stooping down, he saw the
linen wrappings lying there, but did not go in. Presently Simon Peter
came following behind him, and went into the tomb; and he looked at the
linen wrappings lying there, and the cloth which had been on Jesus'
head, not lying with the wrappings, but rolled up on one side,
separately. Then the other disciple, who had reached the tomb first,
went inside too, and he saw for himself and was convinced. For they did
not then understand the passage of scripture which says that Jesus must
rise again from the dead. The disciples then returned to their
companions.
     Meanwhile Mary was standing close outside the tomb, weeping. Still
weeping, she leant forward into the tomb, and perceived two angels
clothed in white sitting there, where the body of Jesus had been lying,
one where the head and the other where the feet had been. 'Why are you
weeping?' asked the angels. 'They have taken my Master away,' she
answered, 'and I do not know where they have laid him.' After saying
this, she turned round, and looked at Jesus standing there, but she did
not know that it was Jesus. 'Why are you weeping? Whom are you seeking?'
he asked. Supposing him to be the gardener, Mary answered, 'If it was
you, Sir, who carried him away, tell me where you have laid him, and I
will take him away myself.'
     'Mary!' said Jesus. She turned round, and exclaimed in Hebrew,
'Rabboni!' (or, as we should say, "teacher"). 'Do not hold me,' Jesus
said, 'for I have not yet ascended to the Father. But go to my brothers,
and tell them that I am ascending to him who is my Father and their
Father, my God and their God.' Mary of Magdala went and told the
disciples that she had seen the Master, and that he had said this to
her.

     In the evening of the same day -- the first day of the week --
after the doors of the room, in which the disciples were, had been shut
because they were afraid of the religious authorities, Jesus came and
stood among them and said, 'Peace be with you'; after which he showed
them his hands and his side. The disciples were filled with joy when
they saw the Master. Again Jesus said to them, 'Peace be with you. As
the Father has sent me as his messenger, so I am sending you.' After
saying this, he breathed on them, and said, 'Receive the Holy Spirit; if
you remit anyone's sins, they have been remitted; and, if you retain
them, they have been retained.'

     But Thomas, one of the Twelve, called "The Twin," was not with them
when Jesus came; so the rest of the disciples said to him, 'We have seen
the Master!'
     'Unless I see the marks of the nails in his hands,' he exclaimed,
'and put my finger into the marks, and put my hand into his side, I will
not believe it.' A week later the disciples were again in the house, and
Thomas was with them. After the doors had been shut, Jesus came and
stood among them, and said, 'Peace be with you.' Then he said to Thomas,
'Place your finger here, and look at my hands; and place your hand here,
and put it into my side; and do not refuse to believe, but believe.' And
Thomas exclaimed, 'My Master, and my God!'
     'Is it because you have seen me that you have believed?' said
Jesus. 'Blessed are they who have not seen, and yet have believed!'

     There were many other signs of his mission that Jesus gave in
presence of the disciples, which are not recorded in this book; but
these have been recorded so that you may believe that Jesus is the
Christ, the Son of God -- and that, through your belief in his name, you
may have life.

     Later on, Jesus showed himself again to the disciples by the Sea of
Tiberias. It was in this way, -- Simon Peter, Thomas, who was called
"The Twin," Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, Zebedee's sons, and two other
disciples of Jesus, were together, when Simon Peter said, 'I am going
fishing.'
     'We will come with you,' said the others. They went out and got
into the boat, but caught nothing that night. Just as day was breaking,
Jesus came and stood on the beach; but the disciples did not know that
it was he. 'My children,' he said, 'have you anything to eat?'
     'No,' they answered. 'Cast your net to the right of the boat,' he
said, 'and you will find fish.' So they cast the net, and now they could
not haul it in because of the quantity of fish. The disciple whom Jesus
loved said to Peter, 'It is the Master!' When Simon Peter heard that it
was the Master, he fastened his coat round him (for he had taken it
off), and threw himself into the sea. But the rest of the disciples came
in the boat (for they were only about a hundred yards from shore),
dragging the net full of fish. When they had come ashore, they found a
charcoal fire ready, with some fish already on it, and some bread as
well. 'Bring some of the fish which you have just caught,' said Jesus.
So Simon Peter got into the boat and hauled the net ashore full of large
fish, a hundred and fifty-three of them; and yet, although there were so
many, the net had not been torn. 'Come and have breakfast.', Jesus said.
None of the disciples dared ask him who he was, because they knew it was
the Master. Jesus went and took the bread and gave it to them, and the
fish too. This was the third time that Jesus showed himself to the
disciples after he had risen from the dead.

     When breakfast was over, Jesus said to Simon Peter, 'Simon, son of
John, do you love me more than the others?'
     'Yes, Master,' he answered, 'you know that I am your friend.'
     'Feed my lambs,' said Jesus. Then, a second time, Jesus asked,
'Simon, son of John, do you love me?'
     'Yes, Master,' he answered, 'you know that I am your friend.'
     'Tend my sheep,' said Jesus. The third time, Jesus said to him,
'Simon, son of John, are you my friend?' Peter was hurt at his third
question being "Are you my friend?"; and exclaimed, 'Master, you know
everything! You can tell that I am your friend.'
     'Feed my sheep,' said Jesus. 'In truth I tell you,' he continued,
'when you were young, you used to put on your own clothes, and walk
wherever you wished; but, when you have grown old, you will have to
stretch out your hands, while someone else puts on your clothes, and
takes you where you do not wish.' Jesus said this to show the death by
which Peter was to honour God, and then he added, 'Follow me.' Peter
turned round, and saw the disciple whom Jesus loved following -- the one
who at the supper leant back on the Master's shoulder, and asked him who
it was who would betray him. Seeing him, Peter said to Jesus, 'Master,
what about this man?'
     'If it is my will that he should wait until I come,' answered
Jesus, 'what has that to do with you? Follow me yourself.' So the report
spread among his followers that that disciple was not to die; yet Jesus
did not say that he was not to die, but said 'If it is my will that he
should wait until I come, what has that to do with you?'

     It is this disciple who states these things, and who recorded them;
and we know that his statement is true.

     There are many other things which Jesus did; but, if every one of
them were to be recorded in detail, I suppose that even the world itself
would not hold the books that would be written.

                                  ACTS
                            OF THE APOSTLES


                       [The Church and the Jews]



*The Acts of the Apostles Peter and John*

     The first account which I drew up, Theophilus, dealt with all that
Jesus did and taught from the very first, down to that day on which he
was taken up to heaven, after he had, by the help of the Holy Spirit,
given instructions to the apostles whom he had chosen. With abundant
proofs, he showed himself to them, still living, after his death;
appearing to them from time to time during forty days, and speaking of
all that related to the kingdom of God. And once, when he had gathered
them together, he charged them not to leave Jerusalem, but to wait there
for the fulfilment of the Father's promise -- 'that promise,' he said,
'of which you have heard me speak; for, while John baptised with water,
you will be baptised with the Holy Spirit before many days have passed.'
     So, when the apostles had met together, they asked Jesus this
question -- 'Master, is this the time when you intend to re-establish
the kingdom for Israel?' His answer was, 'It is not for you to know
times or hours, for the Father has reserved these for his own decision;
but you will receive power, when the Holy Spirit will have descended on
you, and will be witnesses for me not only in Jerusalem, but throughout
Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.'
     No sooner had Jesus said this than he was caught up before their
eyes, and a cloud received him from their sight. While they were still
gazing up into the heavens, as he went, suddenly two men, clothed in
white, stood beside them, and said, 'People of Galilee, why are you
standing here looking up into the heavens? This same Jesus, who has been
taken from you into the heavens, will come in the same way in which you
have seen him go into the heavens.'
     Then the apostles returned to Jerusalem from the hill called
Olivet, which is about three quarters of a mile from the city. When they
reached Jerusalem, they went to the upstairs room, where they were
staying. There were there Peter, John, James, and Andrew, Philip and
Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus, Simon the
Zealot, and Judas the son of James. They all united in devoting
themselves to prayer, and so did some women, and Mary, the mother of
Jesus, and his brothers.

     About this time, at a meeting of the Lord's followers, when there
were about a hundred and twenty present, Peter rose to speak. 'Friends,'
he said, 'it was necessary that the prediction of scripture should be
fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit made by the lips of David about Judas,
who acted as guide to the men who arrested Jesus, for he was one of our
number and had his part allotted him in this work of ours.' (This man
had bought a piece of land with the price of his treachery; and, falling
heavily, his body had burst open, and all his bowels protruded. This
became known to everyone living in Jerusalem, so that the field came to
be called, in their language, "Akeldama," which means the "Field of
Blood.")
     'For in the book of Psalms,' Peter continued, 'it is said --

     "Let his home become desolate,
         and let no one live in it";

 and also --

     "His office let another take."
 Therefore, from among the men who have been with us all the time that
Jesus, our Master, went in and out among us -- from his baptism by John
down to that day on which he was taken from us -- someone must be found
to join us as a witness of his resurrection.' So they put forward two
men, Joseph called Barsabbas, whose other name was Justus, and Matthias;
and they offered this prayer --

     'Lord, who reads all hearts, show which of these two men you have
chosen to take the place in this apostolic work, which Judas has
abandoned, to go to his proper place.'
 Then they drew lots between them; and, the lot having fallen to
Matthias, he was added to the number of the eleven apostles.

     In the course of the Festival at the close of the Harvest the
disciples had all met together, when suddenly there came from the
heavens a noise like a strong wind rushing by; it filled the whole house
in which they were sitting. Then there appeared tongues of what seemed
to be flame, separating, so that one settled on each of them; and they
were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and began to speak in different
languages as the Spirit prompted their utterances.
     Now there were then staying in Jerusalem religious Jews from every
country in the world; and, when this sound was heard, numbers of people
collected, in the greatest excitement, because each of them heard the
disciples speaking in his own language. They were utterly amazed, and
kept asking in astonishment, 'What! Are not all these people who are
speaking Galileans? Then how is it that we each of us hear them in our
own language? Some of us are Parthians, some Medes, some Elamites; and
some of us live in Mesopotamia, in Judea and Cappadocia, in Pontus and
Roman Asia, in Phrygia and Pamphylia, in Egypt and the districts of
Libya adjoining Cyrene; some of us are visitors from Rome, either Jews
by birth or converts, and some are Cretans and Arabians -- yet we all
alike hear them speaking in our own languages of the great things that
God has done.' They were all utterly amazed and bewildered.
    'What does it mean?' they asked one another. But there were some who
said with a sneer, 'They have had too much new wine.'
     Then Peter, surrounded by the eleven other apostles, stood up, and,
raising his voice, addressed the crowd. 'People of Judea,' he began,
'and all you who are staying in Jerusalem, let me tell you what this
means. Mark well my words. These people are not drunk, as you suppose;
for it is only now nine in the morning! No! This is what is spoken of in
the prophet Joel --

     "It will come about in the last days," God says,
         "That I will pour out my Spirit on all humanity;
     your sons and your daughters will become prophets,
     your young men will see visions,
     and your old men dream dreams;
         yes, even on the slaves -- for they are mine -- both men and
women,
         I will in those days pour out my Spirit,
             and they will become prophets;
     and I will show wonders in the heavens above,
     and signs on the earth below --
         blood and fire and mist of smoke;
     the sun will become darkness,
     and the moon blood-red,
         before the day of the Lord comes -- that great and awful day.
             Then will everyone who invokes the name of the Lord be
saved."
 People of Israel, listen to what I am saying. Jesus of Nazareth, a man
whose mission from God to you was proved by miracles, wonders, and
signs, which God showed among you through him, as you know full well --
he, I say, in accordance with God's definite plan and with his previous
knowledge, was betrayed, and you, by the hands of lawless men, nailed
him to a cross and put him to death. But God released him from the pangs
of death and raised him to life, it being impossible for death to retain
its hold on him. Indeed he was the one David was referring to when he
said --

     "I have had the Lord ever before my eyes,
         for he stands at my right hand, so that I should not be
disquieted.
     Therefore my heart was cheered, and my tongue told its delight;
         yes, even my body, too, will rest in hope;
     For you will not abandon my soul to Hades,
         nor surrender me, your holy one, to undergo corruption.
     You have shown me the path to life,
         you will fill me with gladness in your presence."
 Friends, I can speak to you the more confidently about the patriarch
David, because he is dead and buried, and his tomb is here among us to
this very day. David, then, prophet as he was, knowing that God had
solemnly sworn to him to set one of his descendants on his throne,
looked into the future, and referred to the resurrection of the Christ
when he said that he had not been abandoned to Hades, nor had his body
undergone corruption. It was this Jesus, whom God raised to life; and of
that we are ourselves all witnesses. And now that he has been exalted to
the right hand of God, and has received from the Father the promised
gift of the Holy Spirit, he has begun to pour out that gift, as you
yourselves now see and hear. It was not David who went up into heaven;
for he himself says --

     "The Lord said to my master, 'Sit on my right hand,
     Until I put your enemies as a footstool under your feet.'"
 So let the whole nation of Israel know beyond all doubt, that God has
made him both Lord and Christ -- this Jesus whom you crucified.'
     When the people heard this, they were conscience-smitten, and said
to Peter and the rest of the apostles, 'Friends, what can we do?'
     'Repent,' answered Peter, 'and be baptised every one of you in the
name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins; and then you will
receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. For the promise is for you and for
your children, and also for all those now far away, who may be called by
the Lord our God.'
     Peter spoke to them for a long time using many other arguments and
pleaded with them -- 'Save yourselves from the perverse spirit of this
age.' So those who accepted his teaching were baptised, and about three
thousand people joined the disciples on that day alone. They devoted
themselves to the teaching of the apostles and to the Common life of the
church, to the breaking of the bread and to the Prayers.
     A deep impression was made on everyone, and many wonders and signs
were done at the hands of the apostles. All who became believers in
Christ held everything for the common use; they sold their property and
their goods, and shared the proceeds among them all, according to their
individual needs. Every day they devoted themselves to meeting together
in the Temple Courts, and to the breaking of bread at their homes, while
they partook of their food in simple-hearted gladness, praising God, and
winning the goodwill of all the people. And the Lord daily added to
their company those who were in the path of salvation.

     One day, as Peter and John were going up into the Temple Courts for
the three o'clock Prayers, a man, who had been lame from his birth, was
being carried by. This man used to be set down every day at the gate of
the Temple called "the Beautiful Gate," to beg of those who went in.
Seeing Peter and John on the point of entering, he asked them to give
him something. Peter fixed his eyes on him, and so did John, and then
Peter said, 'Look at us.'
     The man was all attention, expecting to get something from them;
but Peter added, 'I have no gold or silver, but I give you what I have.
In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, get up and walk.' Grasping the
lame man by the right hand, Peter lifted him up. Instantly the man's
feet and ankles became strong, and, leaping up, he stood and began to
walk about, and then went with them into the Temple Courts, walking, and
leaping, and praising God. All the people saw him walking about and
praising God; and, when they recognised him as the man who used to sit
begging at the Beautiful Gate of the Temple, they were utterly
astonished and amazed at what had happened to him. While the man still
clung to Peter and John, the people all quickly gathered round them in
the Colonnade named after Solomon, in the greatest astonishment.
     On seeing this, Peter said to the people, 'People of Israel, why
are you surprised at this? And why do you stare at us, as though we, by
any power or piety of our own, had enabled this man to walk? The God of
Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the God of our ancestors, has done honour to
his servant Jesus -- him whom you gave up and disowned before Pilate,
when he had decided to set him free. You, I say, disowned the holy and
righteous one, and asked for the release of a murderer! The guide to
life you put to death! But God raised him from the dead -- and of that
we are ourselves witnesses. And it is by faith in the name of Jesus,
that this man, whom you all see and know, has -- by his name -- been
made strong. Yes, it is the faith inspired by Jesus that has made this
complete cure of the man, before the eyes of you all. And yet, my
friends, I know that you acted as you did from ignorance, and your
rulers also. But it was in this way that God fulfilled all that he had
long ago foretold, as to the sufferings of his Christ, by the lips of
all the prophets. Therefore, repent and turn so that your sins may be
wiped away; so that happier times may come from the Lord himself, and so
that he may send you, in Jesus, your long-appointed Christ. But heaven
must be his home, until the days of the Universal Restoration, of which
God has spoken by the lips of his holy prophets from the very first.
Moses himself said --

     "The Lord your God will raise up from among yourselves a prophet,
as he raised me. To him you will listen whenever he speaks to you. And
it will be that should anyone among the people not listen to that
prophet, he will be utterly destroyed."
 Yes, and all the prophets from Samuel onwards, and all their successors
who had a message to deliver, told of these days. You yourselves are the
heirs of the prophets, and heirs, too, of the covenant which God made
with your ancestors, when he said to Abraham --

     "In your descendants will all the nations of the earth be blessed."
 For you, first, God raised up his servant, and sent him to bless you,
by turning each one of you from his wicked ways.'  While Peter and John
were still speaking to the people, the chief priest, with the officer in
charge at the Temple and the Sadducees, came up to them, much annoyed
because they were teaching the people, and because, through Jesus, they
were preaching the resurrection from the dead. They arrested the
apostles and, as it was already evening, had them placed in custody
until the next day. Many, however, of those who had heard the apostles'
message became believers in Christ, the number of the men alone
amounting to about five thousand.

     The next day, a meeting of the leaders of the people, the elders,
and the teachers of the Law was held in Jerusalem. There were present
Annas the high priest, Caiaphas, John, Alexander, and all who were of
High-Priestly rank. They had Peter and John brought before them, and
questioned them.
    'By what power,' they asked, 'Or in whose name have men like you
done this thing?'
     Then, Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said, 'Leaders of the
people and elders, since we are on our trial today for a kind act done
to a helpless man, and are asked in what way the man here before you has
been cured, let me tell you all and all the people of Israel, that it is
by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified and whom God
raised from the dead -- it is, I say, by his name that this man stands
here before you lame no longer. Jesus is "the stone which, scorned by
you the builders, has yet become the corner stone." And salvation is in
him alone; for there is no other name in the whole world, given to
people, to which we must look for our salvation.'
     When the Council saw how boldly Peter and John spoke, and found
that they were uneducated men of humble station, they were surprised,
and realised that they had been companions of Jesus. But, when they
looked at the man who had been healed, standing there with them, they
had nothing to say. So they ordered them out of court, and then began
consulting together.
     'What are we to do to these men?' they asked one another. 'That a
remarkable sign has been given through them is obvious to everyone
living in Jerusalem, and we cannot deny it. But, to prevent this thing
from spreading further among the people, let us warn them not to speak
in this name any more to anyone whatever.'
     So they called the apostles in, and ordered them not to speak or
teach in the name of Jesus.
     But Peter and John replied, 'Whether it is right, in the sight of
God, to listen to you rather than to him -- judge for yourselves, for we
cannot help speaking of what we have seen and heard.' However, after
further warnings, the Council set them at liberty, not seeing any safe
way of punishing them, because of the people, for they were all praising
God for what had occurred; for the man who was the subject of this
miraculous cure was more than forty years old.

     After they had been set at liberty, the apostles went to their
friends and told them what the chief priests and the elders had said to
them. All who heard their story, moved by a common impulse, raised their
voices to God in prayer:

     'Sovereign Lord, it is you who has made the heavens, the earth, the
sea, and everything that is in them, and who, by the lips of our
ancestor, your servant David, who spoke under the influence of the Holy
Spirit, have said --
         "Why did the nations rage,
             and the peoples form vain designs?
         The kings of the earth set their array,
         and its rulers gathered together,
             against the Lord and against his Christ."
     There have indeed gathered together in this city against your holy
servant Jesus, whom you has consecrated the Christ, not Herod and
Pontius Pilate only, but the nations and the people of Israel besides --
yet only to do what you, by your power and of your own will, did long
ago destine to be done. Now, therefore, Lord, mark their threats, and
enable your servants, with all fearlessness, to tell your message, while
you stretch out your hand to heal, and cause signs and wonders to take
place through the name of your holy servant Jesus.'
 When their prayer was ended, the place in which they were assembled was
shaken; and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and began to tell
God's message fearlessly.

     The whole body of those who had become believers in Christ were of
one heart and mind. Not one of them claimed any of his goods as his own,
but everything was held for the common use. The apostles continued with
great power to bear their testimony to the resurrection of the Lord
Jesus, and God's blessing rested on them all abundantly. Nor was there
anyone in need among them, for all who were owners of land or houses
sold them, and brought the proceeds of the sales and laid them at the
apostles' feet; and then everyone received a share in proportion to his
wants. A Levite of Cyprian birth, named Joseph, (who had received from
the apostles the additional name of "Barnabas" -- which means "The
Consoler,") Sold a farm that belonged to him, and brought the money and
laid it at the apostles' feet.

     There was, however, a man named Ananias, who, with his wife
Sapphira, sold some property, and, with her connivance, kept back some
of the proceeds. He brought only a part and laid it at the apostles'
feet.
     'Ananias,' Peter exclaimed, 'how is it that Satan has so taken
possession of your heart that you have lied to the Holy Spirit, and kept
back a part of the money paid for the land? While it was unsold, was not
it your own? And after it was sold, was not the money at your own
disposal? How did you come to think of such a thing? You have lied, not
to people, but to God!'
     As Ananias heard these words, he fell down and expired; and
everyone who heard of it was appalled. The young men got up, and,
winding the body in a sheet, carried it out and buried it.
     After an interval of about three hours his wife came in, not
knowing what had happened. 'Is it true,' Peter asked, addressing her,
'that you sold your land for such a sum?'
     'Yes,' she answered, 'we did.' Then Peter said, 'How did you come
to agree to provoke the Spirit of the Lord? Listen! The footsteps of
those who have buried your husband are at the door; and they will carry
you out too.'
     Instantly Sapphira fell down at Peter's feet and expired. On coming
in, the young men found her dead; so they carried her out and buried her
by her husband's side. The whole church and all who heard of these
events were appalled.

     Many signs and wonders continued to occur among the people, through
the instrumentality of the apostles, whose custom it was to meet all
together in the Colonnade of Solomon; but of the rest no one ventured to
join them. On the other hand, the people were full of their praise, and
still larger numbers, both of men and women, as they became believers in
the Lord, were added to their number. The consequence was that people
would bring out their sick even into the streets, and lay them on
mattresses and mats, in the hope that, as Peter came by, at least his
shadow might fall on someone of them. Besides this, the inhabitants of
the towns round Jerusalem flocked into the city, bringing with them
their sick and those who were troubled by foul spirits; and they were
cured everyone.

     At this the high priest was roused to action, and he and all his
supporters (who formed the party of the Sadducees), moved by jealousy,
arrested the apostles, and had them placed in custody. An angel of the
Lord, however, opened the prison doors at night and led them out. 'Go,'
he said, 'and stand in the Temple Courts, and tell the people the whole
message of this new life.' When they heard this, they went at daybreak
into the Temple Courts, and began to teach. The high priest and his
party, on their arrival, summoned the High Council, including all the
leaders of the people among the Israelites, and sent to the jail to
fetch the apostles. But, when the officers got there, they did not find
them in the prison; so they returned and reported that, while they had
found the jail barred securely and the guards posted at the doors, yet,
on opening them, they had not found anyone inside. When the officer in
charge at the Temple and the chief priests heard their story, they were
perplexed about the apostles and as to what all this would lead to.
Presently, however, someone came and told them, that the men whom they
had put in prison were actually standing in the Temple Courts, teaching
the people. Then, the officer went with his men and fetched the apostles
-- without using violence, for they were afraid of being stoned by the
people -- and then brought them before the Council. The high priest
demanded an explanation from them.
     'We gave you strict orders,' he said, 'not to teach in this name.
Yet you have actually flooded Jerusalem with your teaching, and you want
to make us responsible for the death of this man.'
     To this Peter and the apostles replied, 'We must obey God rather
than people. The God of our ancestors raised Jesus, whom you put to
death by hanging him on a cross. It is this Jesus whom God has exalted
to his right hand, to be a guide and a Saviour, to give Israel
repentance and forgiveness of sins. And we are witness to the truth of
this, and so is the Holy Spirit -- the gift of God to those who obey
him.'
     The members of the Council became frantic with rage on hearing
this, and were for putting the apostles to death. But Gamaliel, a
Pharisee, who was a Doctor of the Law and who was held in universal
respect, rose in the Council, and directed that the men should be taken
out of court for a little while.
     He then said, 'People of Israel, take care as to what you intend to
do with these men. For not long ago Theudas appeared, professing to be
somebody, and was joined by a body of some four hundred men. But he was
killed; and all his followers scattered and dwindled away. After him,
Judas the Galilean appeared at the time of the census, and induced
people to follow him; yet he, too, perished and all his followers were
dispersed. And, in this present case, my advice to you is not to
interfere with these men, but to leave them alone, for, if their designs
and their work are merely of human origin, they will come to an end;
but, if they are of divine origin, you will be powerless to put an end
to them -- or else you may find yourselves fighting against God!'
     The Council followed his advice, and, calling the apostles in, had
them flogged, and then, after cautioning them not to speak in the name
of Jesus, set them free. But the apostles left the Council, rejoicing
that they had been thought worthy to suffer disgrace for that name; and
never for a single day, either in the Temple Courts or in private
houses, did they cease to teach, or to tell the good news of Jesus, the
Christ.

     About this time, when the number of the disciples was constantly
increasing, complaints were made by the Greek speaking Jews against the
Aramaic speaking Jews, that their widows were being overlooked in the
daily distribution. The Twelve, therefore, called together the general
body of the disciples and said to them, 'It is not well for us to see to
the distribution at the tables and neglect God's message. Therefore,
friends, look for seven men of reputation among yourselves, wise and
spiritually-minded men, and we will appoint them to attend to this
matter; while we, for our part, will devote ourselves to prayer, and to
the delivery of the message.'
     This proposal was unanimously agreed to; and the disciples chose
Stephen -- a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit -- and Philip,
Prochorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas, and Nicholas of Antioch, a former
convert to Judaism; and they brought these men to the apostles, who,
after praying, placed their hands on them.

     So God's message spread, and the number of the disciples continued
to increase rapidly in Jerusalem, and a large body of the priests
accepted the faith.

     Meanwhile Stephen, divinely helped and strengthened, was showing
great wonders and signs among the people. But some members of the
Synagogue of the Freed Slaves (as it was called), Cyrenians,
Alexandrians, and Visitors from Cilicia and Roman Asia, were roused to
action and began disputing with Stephen; yet they were quite unable to
withstand the wisdom and the inspiration with which he spoke. Then they
induced some men to assert that they had heard Stephen saying
blasphemous things against Moses, and against God; and they stirred up
the people, as well as the elders and the teachers of the Law, and set
on Stephen, and arrested him, and brought him before the High Council.
There they produced witnesses who gave false evidence.
     'This man,' they said, 'is incessantly saying things against this
holy place and the Law; indeed, we have heard him declare that this
Jesus of Nazareth will destroy this place, and change the customs handed
down to us by Moses.' The eyes of all the members of the Council were
riveted on Stephen, and they saw his face looking like the face of an
angel.
     Then the high priest asked, 'Is this true?' Stephen replied,
'Brothers and fathers, hear what I have to say. God, who manifests
himself in the glory, appeared to our ancestor Abraham when he was in
Mesopotamia, and before he settled in Haran, and said to him -- "Leave
your country and your people, and come into the country that I will show
you." And so Abraham left the country of the Chaldaeans and settled in
Haran; and from there, after his father's death, God caused him to
migrate into this country, in which you are now living. God did not at
that time give him any part of it, not even a foot of ground. But he
promised to give him possession of it and his descendants after him,
though at that time he had no child. God's words were these --
"Abraham's descendants will live in a foreign country, where they will
be enslaved and ill-treated for four hundred years. But I myself will
judge the nation, to which they will be enslaved," God said, "and after
that they will leave the country and worship me in this place." Then God
made with Abraham the covenant of circumcision; and under it Abraham
became the father of Isaac, and circumcised him when he was eight days
old; and Isaac became the father of Jacob; and Jacob of the Twelve
Patriarchs. The Patriarchs, out of jealousy, sold Joseph into slavery in
Egypt; but God was with him, and delivered him out of all his troubles,
and enabled him to win favour and show wisdom before Pharaoh, king of
Egypt, who appointed him Governor of Egypt and of his whole household.
Then a famine spread over the whole of Egypt and Canaan, causing great
distress, and our ancestors could find no food. Hearing, however, that
there was corn in Egypt, Jacob sent our ancestors there on their first
visit. In the course of their second visit, Joseph revealed himself to
his brothers, and his family became known to Pharaoh. Then Joseph sent
an urgent invitation to his father Jacob and to his relatives, seventy-
five persons in all; and so Jacob went down into Egypt. There he died,
and our ancestors also, and their bodies were removed to Shechem, and
laid in the tomb which Abraham had bought for a sum of money from the
sons of Hamor in Shechem. As the time drew near for the fulfilment of
the promise which God had made to Abraham, the people increased largely
in numbers in Egypt, until a new king, who knew nothing of Joseph, came
to the throne. This king acted deceitfully towards our people and ill-
treated our ancestors, making them abandon their own infants, so that
they should not be reared. It was just at this time that Moses was born.
He was an exceedingly beautiful child, and for three months was brought
up in his own father's house; and, when he was abandoned, the daughter
of Pharaoh found him and brought him up as her own son. So Moses was
educated in all the learning of the Egyptians, and proved his ability
both by his words and actions. When he was in his fortieth year, he
resolved to visit his fellow Israelites; and, seeing an Israelite ill-
treated, he defended him, and avenged the man, who was being wronged, by
striking down the Egyptian. He thought his own people would understand
that God was using him to save them; but they failed to do so. The next
day he again appeared on the scene, when some of them were fighting, and
tried to make peace between them. "Men," he said, "you are brothers; how
is it that you are ill-treating one another?" But the man who was ill-
treating his fellow workman pushed Moses aside saying -- "Who made you a
ruler and judge over us? Do you mean to make away with me as you did
yesterday with that Egyptian?" At these words Moses took to flight, and
became an exile in Midian; and there he had two sons born to him. Forty
years had passed when there appeared to him, in the desert of Mount
Sinai, an angel in a flame of fire in a bush. When Moses saw it, he was
astonished at the vision; but on his going nearer to look at it more
closely, the voice of the Lord was heard to say -- "I am the God of your
ancestors, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob." Moses trembled, and
did not dare to look. Then the Lord said to him -- "Take your sandals
off your feet, for the spot where you are standing is holy ground. I
have seen the oppression of my people who are in Egypt, and heard their
groans, and I have come down to deliver them. Come now and I will send
you into Egypt." This same Moses, whom they had disowned with the words
-- "Who made you a ruler and a judge?" was the man whom God sent to be
both a ruler and a deliverer, under the guidance of the angel that had
appeared to him in the bush. He it was who led them out, after he had
shown wonders and signs in Egypt, in the Red Sea, and in the desert
during forty years. This was the Moses who said to the people of Israel
-- "God will raise up for you, from among yourselves, a prophet, as he
raised up me." He, too, it was who was present at the assembly in the
desert, with the angel who talked to him on Mount Sinai, and with our
ancestors, and who received living truths to impart to you. Yet our
ancestors refused him obedience; more than that, they rejected him, and
in their hearts turned back to Egypt, while they said to Aaron -- "Make
us Gods who will lead the way for us, since, as for this Moses who has
brought us out of Egypt, we do not know what has become of him." That
was the time when they made the calf and offered sacrifice to their
idol, and held festivities in honour of their own handiwork! So God
turned from them and left them to the worship of the Starry Host, as is
written in the book of the prophets --

     "Did you offer victims and sacrifices to me, house of Israel,
         all those forty years in the desert?
     You took with you the tent where Moloch is worshipped
     and the star of the god Rephan --
         the images which you had made to worship.
             Therefore I will exile you beyond Babylon."
 Our ancestors had the tent where they worshipped God in the desert,
constructed, just as he who spoke to Moses had directed him to make it,
after the model which he had seen. This tent, which was handed down to
them, was brought into this country by our ancestors who accompanied
Joshua (at the conquest of the nations that God drove out before their
advance), and remained here until the time of David. David found favour
with God, and prayed that he might provide the God of Jacob with a place
to reside. But it was Solomon who built a house for God. Yet it is not
in buildings made by hands that the Most High dwells. As the prophet
says --

     "The heavens are a throne for me,
         and the earth a stool for my feet.
     What manner of house will you build me, asks the Lord,
         or what place is there where I may rest?
             Was it not my hand that made all these things?"
 Stubborn people, heathen in heart and ears, you are for ever resisting
the Holy Spirit; your ancestors did it, and you are doing it still.
Which of the prophets escaped persecution at their hands? They killed
those who foretold the coming of the righteous one; of whom you, in your
turn, have now become the betrayers and murderers -- you who received
the Law as transmitted by angels and yet failed to keep it.'
     As they listened to this, the Council grew frantic with rage, and
gnashed their teeth at Stephen. He, filled as he was with the Holy
Spirit, fixed his eyes intently on the heavens, and saw the glory of God
and Jesus standing at God's right hand.
     'Look,' he exclaimed, 'I see heaven open and the Son of Man
standing at God's right hand!' At this, with a loud shout, they stopped
their ears and all rushed on him, forced him outside the city, and began
to stone him, the witnesses laying their clothes at the feet of a young
man named Saul. And they stoned Stephen, while he cried to the Lord,
'Lord Jesus! Receive my spirit!' Falling on his knees, he called out
loudly, 'Lord! Do not charge them with this sin;' and with these words
he fell asleep.
     Saul approved of his being put to death.
    On that very day a great persecution broke out against the church
which was in Jerusalem; and its members, with the exception of the
apostles, were all scattered over the districts of Judea and Samaria.
Some religious men buried Stephen, with loud lamentations for him. But
Saul began to devastate the church; he entered house after house,
dragged out men and women alike, and threw them into prison.
     Now those who were scattered in different directions went from
place to place proclaiming the good news. Philip went down to the city
of Samaria, and there began to preach the Christ. The people, one and
all, listened attentively to what Philip told them, when they heard of,
and saw, the miracles which he was working. For there were many
instances of people with foul spirits, where the spirits, with loud
screams, came out of them; and many who were paralysed or lame were
cured, so that there was great rejoicing throughout that city. There was
staying in the city a man named Simon, who had been practicing magic
there and mystifying the Samaritan people, giving himself out to be some
great being. Everyone, high and low, paid attention to him. "This man,"
they used to say, "must be that power of God which people call 'The
Great Power.'" And they paid attention to him because they had for a
long time been mystified by his magic arts. However, when they came to
believe Philip, as he told them the good news about the kingdom of God
and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptised, both men and women.
Even Simon believed, and after his baptism attached himself to Philip,
and was in his turn mystified at seeing signs and great miracles
constantly occurring.
     When the apostles at Jerusalem heard that the Samaritans had
welcomed God's message, they sent Peter and John to them; and they, on
their arrival, prayed that the Samaritans might receive the Holy Spirit.
(As yet the Spirit had not descended on any of them; they had only been
baptised in the name of the Lord Jesus). Then Peter and John placed
their hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit.
     When Simon saw that it was through the placing of the apostles'
hands on them that the Spirit was given, he brought them a sum of money
and said, 'Give me also this power of yours, so that, if I place my
hands on anyone, he may receive the Holy Spirit.'
     'A curse on you and on your silver,' Peter exclaimed, 'for thinking
that God's free gift can be bought with money! You have no share or part
in our message, for your heart is not right with God. Therefore repent
of this wickedness of yours, and pray to the Lord, that, if possible,
you may be forgiven for such a thought; for I see that you have fallen
into the bitterness of envy and the fetters of sin.'
     'Pray to the Lord for me, all of you,' Simon answered, 'so that
none of the things you have spoken of may happen to me.'
     Peter and John, having borne their testimony and delivered the
Lord's message, returned to Jerusalem, telling the good news, as they
went, in many Samaritan villages.
     Meanwhile an angel of the Lord had said to Philip, 'Set out on a
journey southwards, along the road that runs down from Jerusalem to
Gaza.' (It is now deserted). So Philip set out on a journey; and on his
way he came on an official of high rank, in the service of Candace,
Queen of the Abyssinians. He was her treasurer, and had been to
Jerusalem to worship, and was now on his way home, sitting in his
carriage and reading the prophet Isaiah.
     The Spirit said to Philip, 'Go up to the carriage over there and
keep close to it.' So Philip ran up, and he heard the Abyssinian reading
the prophet Isaiah.
     'Do you understand what you are reading?' he asked. 'How can I,'
the other answered, 'unless someone will explain it to me?' and he
invited Philip to get up and sit by his side. The passage of scripture
which he was reading was this --

     "Like a sheep, he was led away to slaughter,
         and as a lamb is dumb in the hands of its shearer,
         so he refrains from opening his lips.
     He was humiliated and justice was denied him.
     Who will tell the story of his generation?
         For his life is cut off from earth."
 'Now,' said the Treasurer, addressing Philip, 'tell me, of whom is the
prophet speaking? Of himself, or of someone else?' Then Philip began,
and, taking this passage as his text, told him the good news about
Jesus.
     Presently, as they were going along the road, they came to some
water, and the Treasurer exclaimed, 'Look! Here is water; what is to
prevent my being baptised?' {  (8:37)  Some later manuscripts add:
Philip said, 'If you believe with your whole heart, you may.' And he
replied, 'I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.' } So he
ordered the carriage to stop, and they went down into the water -- both
Philip and the Treasurer -- and Philip baptised him. But, when they came
up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught Philip away, and the
Treasurer saw no more of him; for he continued his journey with a joyful
heart. But Philip was found at Ashdod, and, as he went on his way, he
told the good news in all the towns through which he passed, until he
came to Caesarea.

     Meanwhile Saul, still breathing murderous threats against the
disciples of the Lord, went to the high priest, and asked him to give
him letters to the Jewish congregations at Damascus, authorising him, if
he found there any supporters of the Way, whether men or women, to have
them put in chains and brought to Jerusalem.
     While on his journey, as he was nearing Damascus, suddenly a light
from the heavens flashed around him. He fell to the ground and heard a
voice saying to him -- 'Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?'
     'Who are you, Lord?' he asked.
     'I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting,' the voice answered; 'Yet
stand up and go into the city, and you will be told what you must do.'
     The men traveling with Saul were meanwhile standing speechless;
they heard the sound of the voice, but saw no one. When Saul got up from
the ground, though his eyes were open, he could see nothing. So his men
led him by the hand, and brought him into Damascus; and for three days
he was unable to see, and took nothing either to eat or to drink.

     Now there was at Damascus a disciple named Ananias, to whom, in a
vision, the Lord said, 'Ananias.'
     'Yes, Lord,' he answered. 'Go at once,' said the Lord, 'to the
Straight Street, and ask at Judas's house for a man named Saul, from
Tarsus. He is at this moment praying, and he has seen, in a vision, a
man named Ananias coming in and placing his hands on him, so that he may
recover his sight.'
     'Lord,' exclaimed Ananias, 'I have heard from many people about
this man -- how much harm he has done at Jerusalem to your people there.
And, here, too, he holds authority from the chief priests to put in
chains all those who invoke your name.' But the Lord said to him, 'Go,
for this man is my chosen instrument to uphold my name before the
Gentiles and their kings, and the people of Israel. I will myself show
him all that he has to suffer for my name.'
     So Ananias went, entered the house, and, placing his hands on Saul,
said, 'Saul, my brother, I have been sent by the Lord -- by Jesus, who
appeared to you on your way here -- so that you may recover your sight
and be filled with the Holy Spirit.' Instantly it seemed as if a film
fell from Saul's eyes, and his sight was restored. Then he got up and
was baptised, and, after he had taken food, he felt his strength return.

     Saul stayed for some days with the disciples who were at Damascus,
and at once began in the synagogues to proclaim Jesus as the Son of God.
All who heard him were amazed.
    'Is not this,' they asked, 'the man who worked havoc in Jerusalem
among those that invoke this name, and who had also come here for the
express purpose of having such persons put in chains and taken before
the chief priests?' Saul's influence, however, kept steadily increasing,
and he confounded the Jewish people who lived in Damascus by the proofs
that he gave that Jesus was the Christ.
     After some time some of them laid a plot to kill Saul, but it
became known to him. They even watched the gates day and night, to kill
him; but his disciples let him down by night through an opening in the
wall, lowering him in a basket.
     On his arrival in Jerusalem, Saul attempted to join the disciples,
but they were all afraid of him, as they did not believe that he was
really a disciple. Barnabas, however, taking him by the hand, brought
him to the apostles, and told them the whole story of how Saul on his
journey had seen the Lord, and how the Lord had talked to him, and how
in Damascus he had spoken out fearlessly in the name of Jesus. After
that, Saul remained in Jerusalem, in close contact with the apostles;
and he spoke fearlessly in the name of the Lord, talking and arguing
with the Jews of foreign birth, who, however, made attempts to kill him.
But, when the followers found this out, they took him down to Caesarea,
and sent him on his way to Tarsus.

     And so it came about that the church, throughout Judea, Galilee,
and Samaria, enjoyed peace and became firmly established; and, ordering
its life by respect for the Lord and the help of the Holy Spirit, it
increased in numbers.

     Peter, while traveling from place to place throughout the country,
went down to visit the people of Christ living at Lydda. There he found
a man named Aeneas, who had been bedridden for eight years with
paralysis. 'Aeneas,' Peter said to him, 'Jesus Christ cures you. Get up,
and make your bed.' Aeneas got up at once; and all the inhabitants of
Lydda and of the Plain of Sharon saw him, and came over to the Lord's
side.
     At Joppa there lived a disciple whose name was Tabitha, which is in
Greek "Dorcas" -- a Gazelle. Her life was spent in doing kind and
charitable actions. Just at that time she was taken ill, and died; and
they had washed her body and laid it out in an upstairs room. Joppa was
near Lydda, and the disciples, having heard that Peter was at Lydda,
sent two men with the request that he come to them without delay. Peter
returned with them at once. On his arrival, he was taken upstairs, and
all the widows came round him in tears, showing the coats and other
clothing which Dorcas had made while she was among them. But Peter sent
everybody out of the room, and knelt down and prayed. Then, turning to
the body, he said, 'Tabitha! Stand up.'
    She opened her eyes, and, seeing Peter, sat up. Giving her his hand,
Peter raised her up, and, calling in the widows and others of Christ's
people, presented her to them alive. This became known all through
Joppa, and numbers of people came to believe in the Lord. And Peter
stayed some days at Joppa with a tanner named Simon.

     At Caesarea there was a man named Cornelius, a centurion in the
regiment known as the "Italian Regiment," A religious man and one who
reverenced God, with all his household. He was liberal in his charities
to the people, and prayed to God constantly. One afternoon, about three
o'clock, he distinctly saw in a vision an angel from God come to him,
and call him by name. Cornelius fixed his eyes on him and, in great
alarm, said, 'What is it, Lord?'
    'Your prayers and your charities,' the angel answered, 'have been an
acceptable offering to God. And now, send messengers to Joppa and fetch
a man called Simon, who is also known as Peter. He is lodging with a
tanner named Simon, who has a house near the sea.'
     When the angel, who had spoken to him, had gone, Cornelius called
two servants and a religious soldier, who was one of his constant
attendants, and, after telling them the whole story, sent them to Joppa.
     On the next day, while these men were on their way, just as they
were nearing the town, Peter went up on the housetop about midday to
pray. He became hungry and wanted something to eat; but while it was
being prepared, he fell into a trance, and saw that the heavens were
open, and that something like a great sail was descending, let down by
its four corners towards the earth. In it were all kinds of quadrupeds,
reptiles, and birds. Then he was aware of a voice which said -- 'Stand
up, Peter, kill something, and eat.'
     'No, Lord, I cannot,' answered Peter, 'for I have never eaten
anything defiled and unclean.' Again he was aware of a voice which said
-- 'What God has pronounced clean, do not regard as defiled.' This
happened three times, and then suddenly it was all taken up into the
heavens.
     While Peter was still perplexed as to the meaning of the vision
that he had seen, the men sent by Cornelius, having enquired the way to
Simon's house, came up to the gate, and called out and asked if the
Simon, who was also known as Peter, was lodging there. Peter was still
pondering over the vision, when the Spirit said to him, 'There are two
men looking for you at this moment. Go down at once and do not hesitate
to go with them, for I have sent them.'
     Peter went down to the men and said, 'I am the person you are
looking for. What is your reason for coming?'
     The men replied, 'Our centurion, Cornelius, a pious man who
reverences God and is well spoken of by the whole Jewish nation, has
been instructed by a holy angel to send for you to his house, and to
listen to what you have to say.' So Peter invited them in and
entertained them.
     The next day he lost no time in setting out with them, accompanied
by some of the Lord's followers from Joppa; and the day following he
entered Caesarea. Cornelius was expecting them, and had invited his
relatives and intimate friends to meet them. So, when Peter entered the
city, Cornelius met him, and, throwing himself at Peter's feet, bowed to
the ground. Peter, however, lifted him up, saying as he did so, 'Stand
up, I am only human like yourself.'
     Talking with him as he went, Peter entered the house, where he
found a large gathering of people, to whom he said, 'You are doubtless
aware that it is forbidden for a Jew to be intimate with a foreigner, or
even to enter his house; and yet God has shown me that I ought not to
call anyone defiled or unclean. That was why I came, when I was sent
for, without raising any objection. And now I ask your reason for
sending for me.'
     'Just three days ago this very hour,' Cornelius said, 'I was in my
house, saying the Afternoon Prayers, when a man in dazzling clothing
suddenly stood before me. "Cornelius," he said, "your prayer has been
heard, and your charities have been accepted, by God. Therefore send to
Joppa, and invite the Simon, who is also known as Peter, to come here.
He is lodging in the house of Simon the tanner, near the sea."
Accordingly I sent to you at once, and you have been so good as to come.
And now we are all here in the presence of God, to listen to all that
you have been instructed by the Lord to say.' Then Peter began.
    'I see, beyond all doubt,' he said, 'that God does not show
partiality, but that in every nation he who reverences him and does what
is right is acceptable to him. God has sent his message to the
Israelites and told them, through Jesus Christ, the good news of peace
-- and Jesus is Lord of all! You yourselves know the story which spread
through all Judea, how, beginning from Galilee, after the baptism which
John proclaimed -- the story, I mean, of Jesus of Nazareth, and how God
consecrated him his Christ by enduing him with the Holy Spirit and with
power; and how he went about doing good and curing all who were under
the power of the devil, because God was with him. We are ourselves, too,
witnesses to all that he did in Judea and in Jerusalem; yet they put him
to death by hanging him on a cross! This Jesus God raised on the third
day, and enabled him to appear, not indeed to everyone, but to witnesses
chosen beforehand by God -- to us, who ate and drank with him after his
resurrection from the dead. Further, God charged us to proclaim to the
people, and solemnly affirm, that it is Jesus who has been appointed by
God judge of the living and the dead. To him it is that all the prophets
bear witness, when they say that everyone who believes in him receives
through his name forgiveness of sins.'
     Before Peter had finished saying these words, the Holy Spirit fell
on all who were listening to the message. Those converts from Judaism,
who had come with Peter, were amazed that the gift of the Holy Spirit
had been bestowed even on the Gentiles; for they heard them speaking in
different languages and extolling God. At this Peter asked, 'Can anyone
refuse the water for the baptism of these people, now that they have
received the Holy Spirit as we did ourselves?' And he directed that they
should be baptised in the name of Jesus Christ; after which they asked
him to stay there a few days longer.

     The apostles and the followers throughout Judea heard that even the
Gentiles had welcomed God's message. But, when Peter went up to
Jerusalem, those who were converts from Judaism began to attack him, on
the ground that he had visited people who were not circumcised, and had
taken meals with them. So Peter began to relate the facts to them as
they had occurred. 'I was in the town of Joppa,' he said, 'and was
praying; and, while in a trance, I saw a vision. There was something
like a great sail descending, let down by its four corners out of the
heavens; and it came right down to me. Looking intently at it, I began
to distinguish quadrupeds, wild beasts, reptiles, and birds; and I also
heard a voice saying to me -- "Stand up, Peter, kill something and eat."
"No, Lord, I cannot," I answered, "for nothing defiled or unclean has
ever passed my lips." Then a second time there came a voice from the
heavens. "What God has pronounced clean", it said, "you must not call
defiled." This happened three times, and then all was drawn up again
into the heavens. At that moment three men, who had been sent from
Caesarea to see me, came up to the house in which we were. The Spirit
told me to go with them without hesitation. These six companions also
went with me. And, when we came into the man's house, he told us how he
had seen the angel standing in his house, and how the angel had said to
him -- "Send to Joppa and fetch the Simon, who is also known as Peter;
for he will tell you truths, which will prove the means of salvation to
you and all your household." I had but just begun to speak,' continued
Peter, 'when the Holy Spirit fell on them, exactly as on us at the
first; and I recalled the saying of the Master -- "John baptised with
water, but you will be baptised with the Holy Spirit." Since then, God
had given them the very same gift as he gave us when we became believers
in Jesus Christ the Master -- who was I that I could thwart God?'
     On hearing this statement, they said no more, but broke out into
praise of God. 'So even to the Gentiles,' they exclaimed, 'God has
granted the repentance which leads to life!'

     Now those who had been scattered in different directions, in
consequence of the persecution that followed the death of Stephen, went
as far as Phoenicia, Cyprus, and Antioch, telling the message -- but
only to Jews. Some of them, however, who were men of Cyprus and Cyrene,
on coming to Antioch, addressed themselves also to the Jews of foreign
birth, telling them the good news about that Lord Jesus. The power of
the Lord was with them, so that a great number who had learned to
believe came over to the Lord's side. The news about them reached the
ears of the church at Jerusalem, and they sent Barnabas to Antioch. On
coming there he saw to his great joy these tokens of the loving kindness
of God, and encouraged them all to make up their minds to be faithful to
the Lord -- For Barnabas was a good man and full of the Holy Spirit and
of faith -- and a large number of people took their stand on the Lord's
side. Afterwards Barnabas left for Tarsus to look for Saul; and, when he
had found him, he brought him to Antioch. And so it came about that, for
a whole year, they attended the meetings of the church there, and taught
a large number of people; and it was in Antioch that the disciples were
first called "Christians."

     During this time, some prophets came to Antioch from Jerusalem. One
of them, named Agabus, came forward and, under the influence of the
Spirit, foretold a great famine that was to spread over all the world --
a famine which occurred in the reign of Claudius. So the disciples,
without exception, determined, in proportion to their means, to send
something to help the followers living in Judea. And this they did,
sending it to the church elders by Barnabas and Saul.

     It was at that time that King Herod began to ill-treat some of the
members of the church. He had James, the brother of John, beheaded; and,
when he saw that the Jews were pleased with this, he proceeded to arrest
Peter also. (This was during the Festival of the unleavened bread.)
After seizing Peter, Herod put him in prison, and entrusted him to the
keeping of four Guards of four soldiers each, intending, after the
Passover, to bring him up before the people. So Peter was kept in
prison, but meanwhile the prayers of the church were being earnestly
offered to God on his behalf. Just when Herod was intending to bring him
before the people, on that very night Peter was asleep between two
soldiers, chained to them both, while there were sentries in front of
the door, guarding the prison. Suddenly an angel of the Lord stood by
him, and a light shone in the cell. The angel struck Peter on the side,
and roused him with the words, 'Get up quickly.' The chains dropped from
his wrists, and then the angel said, 'Put on your belt and sandals.'
When Peter had done so, the angel added, 'Throw your cloak round you and
follow me.'
     Peter followed him out, not knowing that what was happening under
the angel's guidance was real, but thinking that he was seeing a vision.
Passing the first Guard, and then the second, they came to the iron gate
leading into the city, which opened to them of itself; and, when they
had passed through that, and had walked along one street, all at once
the angel left him.
     Then Peter came to himself and said, 'Now I know beyond all doubt
that the Lord has sent his angel, and has rescued me from Herod's hands
and from all that the Jewish people have been expecting.' As soon as he
realized what had happened, he went to the house of Mary, the mother of
John who was also known as Mark, where a number of people were gathered
together, praying. On his knocking at the door in the gate, a
maidservant, named Rhoda, came to answer it. She recognized Peter's
voice, but in her joy left the gate unopened, and ran in, and told them
that Peter was standing outside.
     'You are mad!' they exclaimed. But, when she persisted that it was
so, they said, 'It must be his spirit!'
     Meanwhile Peter went on knocking, and, when they opened the gate
and saw him, they were amazed. Peter signed to them with his hand to be
silent, and then told them how the Lord had brought him out of the
prison, adding, 'Tell James and the others all this.' Then he left the
house, and went away to another place.
     In the morning there was a great stir among the soldiers -- what
could have become of Peter! And, when Herod had made further search for
him and failed to find him, he closely questioned the Guard, and ordered
them away to execution. Then he went down from Judea to stay at
Caesarea.
     It happened that Herod was deeply offended with the people of Tyre
and Sidon, but they went in a body to him, and, having succeeded in
winning over Blastus, the Chamberlain, they begged Herod for a
reconciliation, because their country was dependent on the king's for
its food supply. On an appointed day Herod, wearing his state robes,
seated himself on his throne, and delivered an oration. The people kept
shouting, 'It is the voice of God, and not of a person!'
     Instantly an angel of the Lord struck him, because he did not give
God the glory; and he was attacked with worms, and died. Meanwhile the
Lord's message kept extending, and spreading far and wide.

     When Barnabas and Saul had carried out their mission, they returned
to Jerusalem, and took with them John, who was also known as Mark.

                     [The Church and the Gentiles]



*Acts of the Apostle Paul*

     Among the members of the church at Antioch there were several
prophets and teachers -- Barnabas, Simeon who was known by the name of
"Black", Lucius of Cyrene, Manaen, foster-brother of Prince Herod, and
Saul. While they were engaged in the worship of the Lord and were
fasting, the Holy Spirit said, 'Set apart for me Barnabas and Saul, for
the work to which I have called them.' Accordingly, after fasting and
prayer, they placed their hands on them and dismissed them.

     Barnabas and Saul, sent on this mission, as they were, by the Holy
Spirit, went down to Seleucia, and from there sailed to Cyprus. On
reaching Salamis, they began to tell the message of God in the Jewish
synagogues; and they had John with them as an assistant. After passing
through the whole island, they reached Paphos, where they found an
astrologer who pretended to be a prophet -- a Jew by birth, whose name
was Barjoshua. He was at the court of the Governor, Sergius Paulus, a
man of intelligence, who sent for Barnabas and Saul and asked to be told
God's message. But Elymas, the astrologer (for that is the meaning of
the word), opposed them, eager to divert the Governor's attention from
the faith. However, Saul (who is the same as Paul), full of the Holy
Spirit, fixed his eyes on him and said, 'You incarnation of deceit and
all fraud! You son of the devil! You opponent of all that is good! Will
you never cease to divert the straight paths of the Lord? Listen! The
hand of the Lord is on you even now, and you will be blind for a time
and unable to see the sun.' Immediately a mist and darkness fell on him,
and he went feeling about for someone to guide him. When the Governor
saw what had happened, he became a believer in Christ, being greatly
impressed by the teaching about the Lord.

     After this, Paul and his companions set sail from Paphos and went
to Perga in Pamphylia, where John left them and returned to Jerusalem.
The others went on from Perga and arrived at Antioch in Pisidia. There
they went into the synagogue on the Sabbath and took their seats. After
the reading of the Law and the prophets, the synagogue leader sent them
this message -- 'Friends, if you have any helpful words to address to
the people, now is the time to speak.' So Paul rose and, motioning with
his hand, said:
    'People of Israel and all here who worship God, hear what I have to
say. The God of this people Israel chose our ancestors, and during their
stay in Egypt increased the prosperity of the people, and then with
uplifted arm brought them out from that land. For about forty years he
bore with them in the desert; then, after destroying seven heathen
nations in Canaan, he allotted their land to this people -- For about
four hundred and fifty years. In later times he gave them Judges, of
whom the prophet Samuel was the last. And, when they demanded a king,
God gave them Saul the son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, who
reigned for forty years. After removing him, he raised David to the
throne, and bore this testimony to him -- "In David, the son of Jesse, I
have found a man after my own heart, who will carry out all my
purposes." It was from this man's descendants that God, in accordance
with his promise, gave Israel a Saviour -- Jesus; John having first
proclaimed, before the appearance of Jesus, a baptism on repentance for
all the people of Israel. As John was drawing towards the end of his
career, he said "What do you suppose that I am? I am not the Christ. But
there is 'one coming' after me, whose sandal I am not worthy to untie."
Brothers and sisters, descendants of Abraham, and all those among you
who worship God, it was to us that the message of this salvation was
sent. The people of Jerusalem and their leaders, failing to recognise
Jesus, and not understanding the utterances of the prophets that are
read every Sabbath, fulfilled them by condemning him. They found no
ground at all for putting him to death, and yet demanded his execution
from Pilate; and, after carrying out everything written about him, they
took Jesus down from the cross, and laid him in a tomb. But God raised
him from the dead; and he appeared for many days to those who had gone
up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, and who are now witnesses for him
to the people. We also have good news to tell you, about the promise
made to our ancestors -- That our children have had this promise
completely fulfilled to them by God, by his raising Jesus. That is just
what is said in the second Psalm --

     "You are my Son; this day I have become your Father."
 As to his raising Jesus from the dead, never again to return to
corruption, this is what is said --

     "I will give to you the sacred promises made to David;"
 And, therefore, in another Psalm it is said --

     "You will not give up the Holy One to undergo corruption."
 David, after obediently doing God's will in his own time, fell asleep
and was laid by the side of his ancestors, and did undergo corruption;
but Jesus, whom God raised from the dead, did not undergo corruption. I
would, therefore, like you to know, friends, that through Jesus
forgiveness of sins is being proclaimed to you, and that, in union with
him, everyone who believes in him is absolved from every sin from which
under the Law of Moses you could not be absolved. Beware, therefore,
that what is said in the prophets does not come true of you --

     "Look, you despisers, and wonder, and perish;
     for I am doing a deed in your days --
         a deed which, though told you in full, you will never
believe".'
 As Paul and Barnabas were leaving the synagogue, the people begged for
a repetition of this teaching on the next Sabbath. After the
congregation had dispersed, many of the Jews, and of the converts who
joined in their worship, followed Paul and Barnabas, who talked with
them and urged them to continue to rely on the loving kindness of God.
     On the following Sabbath, almost all the city gathered to hear
God's message. But the sight of the crowds of people filled the minds of
the Jews with jealousy, and they kept contradicting Paul's statements in
violent language. Then Paul and Barnabas spoke out fearlessly, and said:
    'It was necessary that the message of God should be told to you
first; but, since you reject it and reckon yourselves not worthy of the
eternal life -- we turn to the Gentiles! For this is the Lord's command
to us --

     "I have destined you for a light to the Gentiles,
     a means of salvation to the ends of the earth".'
 On hearing this, the Gentiles were glad and extolled God's message; and
all those who had been enrolled for eternal life became believers in
Christ; and the Lord's message was carried throughout that district. But
the Jews incited the women of high social standing who worshiped with
them, and the leading men of the town, and started a persecution against
Paul and Barnabas, and drove them out of their region. They, however,
shook the dust off their feet in protest, and went to Iconium, leaving
the disciples full of joy and of the Holy Spirit.

     The same thing occurred in Iconium, where Paul and Barnabas went
into the Jewish synagogue, and spoke in such a way that a great number
of both Jews and Greeks believed in Christ. But the Jews who refused to
believe stirred up the Gentiles, and poisoned their minds against the
Lord's followers. Therefore Paul and Barnabas spent a long time there,
and spoke out fearlessly, relying on the Lord, who confirmed the message
of his love by permitting signs and wonders to take place at their
hands. But the townspeople were divided, some siding with the Jews, some
with the apostles; and, when there was an attempt on the part of both
Gentiles and Jews, with their leaders, to resort to violence and to
stone them, the apostles heard of it, and took refuge in Lystra and
Derbe, towns in Lycaonia, and in the district round, and there they
continued to tell the good news.
     In the streets of Lystra there used to sit a man who had no power
in his feet; he had been lame from his birth, and had never walked. This
man was listening to Paul speaking, when Paul, looking intently at him,
and seeing that he had the faith to be healed, said loudly, 'Stand
upright on your feet.'
    The man leaped up, and began walking about, and the crowd, seeing
what Paul had done, called out in the Lycaonian language, 'The Gods have
come down to us in human form.' So they called Barnabas "Zeus," and Paul
"Hermes," because he took the lead in speaking; and the priest of Zeus-
beyond-the-Walls, accompanied by the crowd, brought bullocks and
garlands to the gates, with the intention of offering sacrifices. But,
when the apostles Barnabas and Paul heard of it, they tore their clothes
and rushed out into the crowd.
     'Friends, why are you doing this?' they shouted. 'We are only
people like yourselves, and we have come with the good news that you
should turn away from these follies to a living God, who made the
heavens, the earth, the sea, and everything that is in them. In bygone
times he permitted all the nations to go their own ways. Yet he has not
failed to give you, in the good he does, some revelation of himself --
sending you from heaven rain and fruitful seasons, and gladdening your
hearts with plenty and good cheer.' Even with this appeal they could
hardly restrain the people from offering sacrifice to them.
     Presently, however, there came some Jews from Antioch, and Iconium
who, after they had won over the people, stoned Paul, and dragged him
out of the town, thinking him to be dead. But, when the disciples had
gathered round him, he got up and went back into the town; the next day
he went with Barnabas to Derbe. After telling the good news throughout
that town, and making a number of converts, they returned to Lystra,
Iconium, and Antioch, reassuring the minds of the disciples, urging them
to remain true to the faith, and showing that it is only through many
troubles that we can enter the kingdom of God. They also appointed
elders for them in every church, and, after prayer and fasting,
commended them to the Lord in whom they had learned to believe. Paul and
Barnabas then went through Pisidia, and came into Pamphylia, and, after
telling the message at Perga, went down to Attaleia. From there they
sailed to Antioch -- the place where they had been committed to the
gracious care of God for the work which they had now finished. After
their arrival, they gathered the church together, and gave an account of
all that God had helped them to do, and especially how he had opened to
the Gentiles the door of faith; and at Antioch they stayed with the
disciples for a considerable time.

     But certain persons came down from Judea, and began to teach the
Lord's followers that, unless they were circumcised, in accordance with
the custom required by Moses, they could not be saved. This gave rise to
a serious dispute, and much discussion, between Paul and Barnabas and
these people, and it was therefore settled that Paul and Barnabas and
others of their number should go up to Jerusalem, to consult the
apostles and church elders about the matter under discussion.
     The church, therefore, sent them on their journey, and they made
their way through Phoenicia and Samaria, telling the story of the
conversion of the Gentiles, to the great joy of all the followers. On
their arrival at Jerusalem, they were welcomed by the church, as well as
by the apostles and the elders, and gave an account of all that God had
helped them to do. Some of the Pharisees' party, however, who had become
believers in Christ, came forward and declared that they were bound to
circumcise converts and to direct them to observe the Law of Moses. The
apostles and the church elders held a meeting to consider this question.
After much discussion, Peter rose and said:
    'You, my friends, know well that long ago God singled me out -- that
through my lips the Gentiles should hear the message of the good news,
and become believers in Christ. Now God, who reads all hearts, declared
his acceptance of the Gentiles, by giving them the Holy Spirit, just as
he did to us. He made no distinction between them and us, when he
purified their hearts by their faith. Why, then, do you now provoke God,
by putting on the necks of these disciples a yoke which neither our
ancestors nor we were able to bear? No, it is through the loving
kindness of the Lord Jesus that we, just as they do, believe that we
have been saved.'
     Every voice in the assembly was hushed, as they listened to
Barnabas and Paul, while they gave an account of all the signs and
wonders which God had shown among the Gentiles through them. After they
had finished speaking, James addressed the Council.
    'Friends,' he began, 'hear what I have to say. Simon has described
the manner in which God first visited the Gentiles, in order to take
from among them a people to bear his name. And that is in harmony with
the words of the prophets, where they say --

     "After this I will return;
     and I will rebuild the house of David which has fallen --
     its ruins I will rebuild,
         and will set it up once more;
     that so the rest of mankind may earnestly seek the Lord --
     even all the Gentiles on whom my name has been bestowed,
         says the Lord, as he does these things, known from long ago."
 In my judgment, therefore, we should not add to the difficulties of
those Gentiles who are turning to God, but we should write to them to
abstain from food that has been polluted by being sacrificed to idols,
from impurity, from eating the flesh of strangled animals, and from
blood. For in every town, for generations past, there have been those
who preach Moses, read as he is in the synagogues every Sabbath.'
     It was then decided by the apostles and the elders, with the assent
of the whole church, to choose some of their number, and send them to
Antioch with Paul and Barnabas. Those chosen were Judas (called
Barsabas) and Silas, who were leaders among the community. They were
bearers of the following letter --

    "The apostles, and the followers who are the church elders, send
their greetings to the followers of the Lord of Gentile birth in
Antioch, Syria, and Cilicia. As we had heard that some of our number had
upset you by their assertions, and unsettled your minds -- without
instructions from us -- We met and decided to choose certain men and
send them to you with our dear friends Barnabas and Paul, who have
risked their lives for the name of our Lord, Jesus Christ. We are
accordingly sending Judas and Silas, and they will tell you by word of
mouth what we are now writing. We have, therefore, decided, under the
guidance of the Holy Spirit, to lay no further burden on you beyond
these necessary conditions -- That you abstain from food offered to
idols, from blood, from eating the flesh of strangled animals, and from
impurity. If you guard yourselves against such things, it will be well
with you. Farewell."
 So the bearers of this letter were sent on their way, and went down to
Antioch. There they called a meeting of all the followers, and delivered
the letter, the reading of which caused great rejoicing by its
encouraging contents. Judas and Silas, who were themselves prophets,
further encouraged the them by many an address, and strengthened their
faith. After some stay, they were dismissed with kind farewells from the
followers, and returned to those who had sent them. {  (15:34)  Some
later manuscripts add: But Silas decided to stay. }
     Paul and Barnabas, however, remained in Antioch, where they taught
and, with the help of many others, told the good news of the Lord's
message. Some time after this, Paul said to Barnabas, 'Let us go back
and visit the Lord's followers in every town in which we have told the
Lord's message, and see how they are prospering.' Barnabas wished to
take with them John, whose other name was Mark; but Paul felt that they
ought not to take with them the man who had deserted them in Pamphylia,
and had not gone on with them to their work. This caused such unpleasant
feeling between them that they parted ways, Barnabas taking Mark and
sailing for Cyprus, while Paul chose Silas for his companion and, after
he had been committed by the followers to the gracious care of the Lord,
started on his journey and went through Syria and Cilicia, strengthening
the churches in the faith.
     Among other places Paul went to Derbe and Lystra. At the latter
place they found a disciple, named Timothy, whose mother was a Jewish
woman who was a believer, while his father was a Greek, and who was well
spoken of by the followers of the Lord in Lystra and Iconium. Wishing to
take this man with him on his journey, Paul caused him to be circumcised
out of consideration for the Jews in that region, for they all knew that
his father had been a Greek. As they traveled from town to town, they
gave the followers the decisions which had been reached by the apostles
and church elders at Jerusalem, for them to observe.
     So the churches grew stronger in the faith, and increased in
numbers from day to day.
     They next went through the Phrygian district of Galatia, but were
restrained by the Holy Spirit from delivering the message in Roman Asia.
When they reached the borders of Mysia, they attempted to go into
Bithynia, but the Spirit of Jesus did not permit them. Passing through
Mysia, they went down to Troas; and there one night Paul saw a vision. A
Macedonian was standing and appealing to him -- "Come over to Macedonia
and help us." So, immediately after Paul had seen the vision, we looked
for an opportunity to cross over to Macedonia, concluding that God had
summoned us to tell the good news to the people there.

     Accordingly we set sail from Troas, and ran before the wind to
Samothrace, reaching Neapolis the next day. From there we made our way
to Philippi, which is the principal city of that part of Macedonia, and
also a Roman Settlement.
    In that city we spent several days. On the Sabbath we went outside
the gate to the riverside, where we supposed there would be a place of
prayer; and we sat down and talked to the women who were gathered there.
Among them was a woman, named Lydia, belonging to Thyatira, a dealer in
purple cloth, who was accustomed to join in the worship of God. The Lord
touched this woman's heart, so that she gave attention to the message
delivered by Paul, and, when she and her household had been baptised,
she urged us to become her guests.
    'Since you have shown your conviction,' she said, 'that I really am
a believer in the Lord, come and stay in my house.' And she insisted on
our doing so.
     One day, as we were on our way to the place of prayer, we were met
by a girl possessed by a divining spirit, who made large profits for her
masters by fortune-telling. This girl followed Paul and the rest of us,
calling, 'These men are servants of the most high God, and they are
bringing you news of a way to salvation.' She had been doing this for
several days, when Paul, much vexed, turned and said to the spirit
within her, 'In the name of Jesus Christ I command you to leave her.'
That very moment the spirit left her.
     When her masters saw that there was no hope of further profit from
her, they seized Paul and Silas, dragged them into the public square to
the authorities, and took them before the Magistrates.
    'These men are causing a great disturbance in our town,' they
complained; 'They are Jews, and they are teaching customs which it is
not right for us, as Romans, to sanction or adopt.'
     The mob rose as one person against them, and the Magistrates
stripped them of their clothing and ordered them to be beaten with rods.
After beating them severely, the Magistrates put them in prison, with
orders to the jailer to keep them in safe custody. On receiving so
strict an order, the Governor put them into the inner cell, and secured
their feet in the stocks. About midnight, while Paul and Silas were
praying and singing hymns to God, and while the prisoners were listening
to them, suddenly there was an earthquake of such violence that the jail
was shaken to its foundations; all the doors flew open, and all the
prisoners' chains were loosened. Roused from his sleep, and seeing the
prison doors open, the Governor drew his sword intending to kill
himself, in the belief that the prisoners had escaped. But Paul called
our loudly, 'Do not harm yourself; we are all here.'
     Calling for a light, the Governor rushed in, and flung himself
trembling at the feet of Paul and Silas. Then he led them out, and said,
'What must I do to be saved?'
     'Believe in Jesus, our Lord,' they replied, 'and you will be saved,
you and your household too.' Then they spoke to him of God's message,
and to all his household as well. And that very hour of the night he
took them and washed their wounds, and he himself and everyone belonging
to him were baptised without delay. Afterwards he took them up to his
house and set before them something to eat, rejoicing that he, with all
his household, had come to believe in God.
     In the morning the Magistrates sent the guards with an order for
the men to be discharged. The jailer told Paul of his instructions. 'The
Magistrates have sent an order for your discharge,' he said, 'so you had
better leave the place at once and go quietly away.'
     But Paul's answer to them was, 'They have flogged us in public
without trial, though we are Roman citizens, and they have put us in
prison, and now they are for sending us out secretly! No, indeed! Let
them come and take us out themselves.' The guards reported his words to
the Magistrates, who, on hearing that Paul and Silas were Roman
citizens, were alarmed, and went to the prison, and did their best to
conciliate them. Then they took them out, and begged them to leave the
city. When Paul and Silas left the prison, they went to Lydia's house,
and, after they had seen the Lord's followers, and encouraged them, they
left the place.

     After passing through Amphipolis and Apollonia, Paul and Silas came
to Thessalonica. Here the Jews had a synagogue; and, following his usual
custom, Paul joined them, and for three Sabbaths addressed them, drawing
his arguments from the scriptures. He laid before them and explained
that the Christ must undergo suffering and rise from the dead; and 'It
is this man,' he declared, 'who is the Christ -- this Jesus about whom I
am telling you.'
     Some of the people were convinced, and threw in their lot with Paul
and Silas, as did also a large body of Greeks who were accustomed to
join in the Jewish services, and a great number of leading women. But
the Jewish leaders, becoming jealous, engaged some worthless fellows
from the streets, and, getting a mob together, kept the city in an
uproar. They attacked Jason's house, with the intention of bringing Paul
and Silas before the Popular Assembly; and, not finding them there, they
proceeded to drag Jason and some of the Lord's followers before the city
magistrates, shouting out,
     'These men, who have turned the world upside down, have now come
here, and have been harboured by Jason! They are all defying the decrees
of the Emperor. They say that someone else is king -- a man called
Jesus!'
     On hearing this, the people and the city magistrates were much
concerned; and, before letting them go, they took bail from Jason and
the others. That very night the followers sent Paul and Silas off to
Beroea; and on reaching that place, they went to the Jewish synagogue.
These Jews of Beroea were better disposed than those in Thessalonica,
for they welcomed the message with great readiness, and daily examined
the scriptures to see if what was said was true. As a consequence, many
of them became believers in Christ, besides a considerable number of
Greek women of position, and of men also. But, when the Jewish leaders
in Thessalonica found out that God's message had been delivered by Paul
at Beroea, they came there too, exciting and disturbing the minds of the
people. The followers immediately arranged for Paul to go away to the
coast, but both Silas and Timothy stayed behind in Beroea. The friends
who escorted Paul took him as far as Athens, and, after receiving a
message for Silas and Timothy to join him as quickly as possible, they
started on their return.

     While Paul was waiting for them at Athens, his heart was stirred at
seeing the whole city full of idols. So he argued in the synagogue with
the Jews and with those who joined in their worship, as well as daily in
the public Square with those who happened to be there. Among others,
some Epicurean and Stoic Philosophers joined issue with him. Some asked
'What is this prater wanting to make out?', while others said 'He seems
to be a preacher of foreign Deities.' (This was because he was telling
the good news about Jesus and the resurrection). So they laid hold of
him and took him to the Court of Areopagus.
    'May we hear,' they asked, 'what new teaching this is which you are
giving? For you are bringing some strange things to our notice, and we
should like to know what they mean.' (All Athenians and the foreigners
staying in the city found no time for anything else but telling, or
listening to, the last new thing.)
     So Paul took his stand in the middle of the Court, and said --
'People of Athens, on every hand I see signs of your being very devout.
For as I was going about, looking at your sacred shrines, I came upon an
altar with this inscription -- "To an Unknown God." What, therefore, you
worship in ignorance, that I am now proclaiming to you. The God who made
the world and all things that are in it -- he, Lord as he is of heaven
and earth, does not live in temples made by hands, neither do human
hands minister to his wants, as though he needed anything, since he
himself gives, to all, life, and breath, and all things. He made all
races of the earth's surface -- fixing a time for their rise and fall,
and the limits of their settlements -- That they might search for God,
if by any means they might feel their way to him and find him. And yet
he is not really far from any one of us; for in him we live and move and
are. To use the words of some of your own poets --

     "His offspring, too, are we."
 Therefore, as the offspring of God, we must not think that the Deity
has any resemblance to anything made of gold, or silver, or stone -- a
work of human art and imagination. True, God looked with indulgence on
the days of people's ignorance, but now he is announcing to everyone
everywhere the need for repentance, because he has fixed a day on which
he intends to judge the world with justice, by a man whom he has
appointed -- and of this he has given all people a pledge by raising
this man from the dead.'
     On hearing of a resurrection of the dead, some began jeering, but
others said that they wanted to hear what he had to say about that
another time. And so Paul left the Court. There were, however, some
people who joined him, and became believers in Christ. Among them were
Dionysius, a member of the Court of Areopagus, a woman named Damaris,
and several others.
     On leaving Athens, Paul next went to Corinth. There he met a Jew of
the name of Aquila, from Pontus, who, with his wife Priscilla, had
lately come from Italy, in consequence of the order which had been
issued by the Emperor Claudius for all Jews to leave Rome. Paul paid
them a visit, and, since their trade was the same as his, he stayed and
worked with them -- their trade was tent-making. Every Sabbath Paul gave
addresses in the synagogue, trying to convince both Jews and Greeks.
     But, when Silas and Timothy had come down from Macedonia, Paul
devoted himself entirely to delivering the message, earnestly
maintaining before the Jews that Jesus was the Christ. However, as they
set themselves against him and became abusive, Paul shook his clothes in
protest and said to them, 'Your blood be on your own heads. My
conscience is clear. From this time forward I will go to the Gentiles.'
     So he left, and went to the house of a certain Titius Justus, who
had been accustomed to join in the worship of God, and whose house was
next door to the synagogue. Crispus, the synagogue leader, came to
believe in the Lord, and so did all his household; and many of the
Corinthians, as they listened to Paul, became believers in Christ and
were baptised. One night the Lord said to Paul, in a vision, 'Have no
fear, but continue to speak, and refuse to be silenced; for I am with
you, and no one will do you harm, for I have many people in this city.'
So he settled there for a year and a half, and taught God's message
among the people.
     While Gallio was governor of Greece, some of the Jewish leaders
made a combined attack on Paul, and brought him before the Governor's
Bench, charging him with persuading people to worship God in a way
forbidden by the Law. Just as Paul was on the point of speaking, Gallio
said to them, 'If this were a case of misdemeanour or some serious
crime, there would be some reason for my listening patiently to you;
but, since it is a dispute about words, and names, and your own Law, you
must see to it yourselves. I do not choose to be a judge in such
matters.'
     Saying this, he drove them back from the Bench. Then they all set
on Sosthenes, the synagogue leader, and beat him in front of the Bench,
but Gallio did not trouble himself about any of these things.
     Paul remained there some time after this, and then took leave of
the followers, and sailed to Syria with Priscilla and Aquila, but not
before his head had been shaved at Cenchreae, because he was under a
vow. They put into Ephesus, and there Paul, leaving his companions, went
into the synagogue and addressed the Jews. When they asked him to
prolong his stay, he declined, saying however, as he took his leave, 'I
will come back again to you, please God,' and then set sail from
Ephesus. On reaching Caesarea, he went up to Jerusalem and exchanged
greetings with the church, and then went down to Antioch. After making
some stay in Antioch, he set out on a tour through the Phrygian district
of Galatia, strengthening the faith of all the disciples as he went.

     Meanwhile there had come to Ephesus an Alexandrian Jew, named
Apollos, an eloquent man, who was well-versed in the scriptures. He had
been well-instructed in the Way of the Lord, and with burning zeal he
spoke of, and taught carefully, the facts about Jesus, though he knew of
no baptism but John's. This man began to speak out fearlessly in the
synagogue; and when Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they took him home
and explained the Way of God to him more carefully still. When he wanted
to cross to Greece, the followers furthered his plans, and wrote to the
disciples there to welcome him. On his arrival he proved of great
assistance to those who had, through the loving kindness of God, become
believers in Christ, for he vigorously confuted the Jews, publicly
proving by the scriptures that Jesus was the Christ.
     While Apollos was at Corinth, Paul passed through the inland
districts of Roman Asia, and went to Ephesus. There he found some
disciples, of whom he asked, 'Did you, when you became believers in
Christ, receive the Holy Spirit?'
    'No,' they answered, 'we did not even hear that there was a Holy
Spirit.'
     'What then was your baptism?' Paul asked. 'John's baptism was a
baptism on repentance,' rejoined Paul, 'and John told the people
(speaking of the "one coming" after him) that they should believe in him
-- that is in Jesus.'
     On hearing this, they were baptised in the name of the Lord Jesus,
and, after Paul had placed his hands on them, the Holy Spirit descended
on them, and they began to speak in other languages and to preach. There
were about twelve of them in all.
     Paul went to the synagogue there, and for three months spoke out
fearlessly, giving addresses and trying to convince his hearers, about
the kingdom of God. Some of them, however, hardened their hearts and
refused to believe, denouncing the Way before the people. So Paul left
them and withdrew his disciples, and gave daily addresses in the
lecture-hall of Tyrannus. This went on for two years, so that all who
lived in Roman Asia, Jews and Greeks alike, heard the Lord's message.
     God did miracles of no ordinary kind by Paul's hands; so that
people would carry home to the sick handkerchiefs or aprons that had
touched his body, and their diseases would leave them and the wicked
spirits go out of them. An attempt was made by some itinerant Jews, who
were exorcists, to use the name of the Lord Jesus over those who had
wicked spirits in them.
    'I order you,' they would say, 'by the Jesus, whom Paul preaches.'
The seven sons of Sceva, a Jewish chief priest, were doing this; but the
wicked spirit answered them, 'Jesus I acknowledge, and Paul I know, but
you -- who are you?'
     Then the man, in whom this wicked spirit was, sprang on them,
mastered both of them, and so completely overpowered them, that they
fled out of the house, stripped of their clothes, and wounded. This
incident came to the knowledge of all the Jews and Greeks living at
Ephesus; they were all awe-struck, and the name of the Lord Jesus was
held in the highest honour. Many, too, of those who had become believers
in Christ came with a full confession of their practices; while a number
of people, who had practiced magic, collected their books and burnt them
publicly; and on reckoning up the price of these, they found it amounted
to fifty thousand silver coins. So irresistibly did the Lord's message
spread and prevail.

     Sometime after these events Paul resolved to go through Macedonia
and Greece, and then make his way to Jerusalem. 'And after I have been
there,' he said, 'I must visit Rome also.' So he sent to Macedonia two
of his helpers, Timothy and Erastus, while he himself stayed for some
time longer in Roman Asia.
     Just about that time a great disturbance arose about the Way. A
silversmith named Demetrius, who made silver models of the shrine of
Artemis, and so gave a great deal of work to the artisans, got these men
together, as well as the workmen engaged in similar occupations, and
said:
    'Men, you know that our prosperity depends on this work, and you see
and hear that not only at Ephesus, but in almost the whole of Roman
Asia, this Paul has convinced and won over great numbers of people, by
his assertion that those Gods which are made by hands are not Gods at
all. So that not only is this business of ours likely to fall into
discredit, but there is the further danger that the Temple of the great
Goddess Artemis will be thought nothing of, and that she herself will be
deprived of her splendour -- though all Roman Asia and the whole world
worship her.'
     When they heard this, the men were greatly enraged, and began
shouting -- 'Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!' The commotion spread
through the whole city, and the people rushed together into the
amphitheater, dragging with them Gaius and Aristarchus, two Macedonians
who were Paul's traveling companions. Paul wished to go into the
amphitheater and face the people, but the disciples would not let him,
while some of the chief religious officials of the province, who were
friendly to him, sent repeated entreaties to him not to trust himself
inside. Meanwhile some were shouting one thing and some another, for the
Assembly was all in confusion, most of those present not even knowing
why they had met. But some of the crowd prompted Alexander, whom several
of the Jewish leaders had pushed to the front, and he waved his hand to
show that he wanted to speak in their defence to the people. However,
when they recognised him as a Jew, one cry broke from them all, and they
continued shouting for two hours -- 'Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!'
     When the Recorder had succeeded in quieting the crowd, he said,
'People of Ephesus, who is there, I ask you, who needs to be told that
this city of Ephesus is the Warden of the Temple of the great Artemis,
and of the statue which fell down from Zeus? As these are undeniable
facts, you ought to keep calm and do nothing rash; for you have brought
these men here, though they are neither robbers of Temples nor
blasphemers of our Goddess. If, however, Demetrius and the artisans who
are acting with him have a charge to make against anyone, there are
court days and there are Magistrates; let both parties take legal
proceedings. But if you want anything more, it will have to be settled
in the regular Assembly. For I tell you that we are in danger of being
proceeded against for today's riot, there being nothing to account for
it; and in that case we will be at a loss to give any reason for this
disorderly gathering.'
     With these words he dismissed the Assembly.

     When the uproar had ceased, Paul sent for the disciples, and, with
encouraging words, said goodbye to them, and started on his journey to
Macedonia. After going through those districts and speaking many
encouraging words to the disciples, he went into Greece, where he stayed
three months. He was about to sail to Syria, when he learned that a plot
had been laid against him by several of the Jewish leaders; so he
decided to return by way of Macedonia. He was accompanied by Sopater the
son of Pyrrhus, of Beroea, Aristarchus and Secundus from Thessalonica,
Gaius of Derbe, and Timothy, as well as by Tychicus and Trophimus of
Roman Asia. These people went to Troas and waited for us there; while we
ourselves sailed from Philippi after the Passover, and joined them five
days later at Troas, where we stayed for a week.
     On the first day of the week, when we had met for the breaking of
bread, Paul, who was intending to leave the next day, began to address
those who were present, and prolonged his address until midnight. There
were a good many lamps in the upstairs room, where we had met; and a
young man named Eutychus, sitting at the window, was gradually overcome
with great drowsiness, as Paul continued his address. At last, quite
overpowered by his drowsiness, he fell from the third story to the
ground, and was picked up for dead. But Paul went down, threw himself on
him, and put his arms round him.
    'Do not be alarmed,' he said, 'he is still alive.' Then he went
upstairs; and, after breaking and partaking of the bread, he talked with
them at great length until daybreak, and then left. Meanwhile they had
taken the boy away alive, and were greatly comforted.
     We started first, went on board ship, and sailed for Assos,
intending to take Paul on board there. This was by his own arrangement,
as he intended to go by land himself. So, when he met us at Assos, we
took him on board and went on to Mitylene. The day after we had sailed
from there, we arrived off Chios, touched at Samos the following day,
and the next day reached Miletus; for Paul had decided to sail past
Ephesus, so as to avoid spending much time in Roman Asia. He was making
haste to reach Jerusalem, if possible, by the Festival at the close of
the Harvest.

     From Miletus, however, he sent to Ephesus and invited the church
elders to meet him; and, when they came, he said to them, 'You know well
the life that I always led among you from the very first day that I set
foot in Roman Asia, serving the Lord, as I did, in all humility, amid
the tears and trials which fell to my lot through the plots of some of
the Jewish leaders. I never shrank from telling you anything that could
be helpful to you, or from teaching you both in public and in private. I
earnestly pointed both Jews and Greeks to the repentance that leads to
God, and to faith in Jesus, our Lord. And now, under spiritual
constraint, I am here on my way to Jerusalem, not knowing what will
happen to me there, except that in town after town the Holy Spirit
plainly declares to me that imprisonment and troubles await me. But I
count my life of no value to myself, if only I may complete the course
marked out for me, and the task that was allotted me by the Lord Jesus
-- which was to declare the good news of the love of God. And now, I
tell you, I know that none of you will ever see my face again -- you
among whom I have gone about proclaiming the kingdom. Therefore I
declare to you this day, that my conscience is clear in regard to the
fate of any of you, for I have not shrunk from announcing the whole
purpose of God regarding you. Be watchful over yourselves, and over the
whole flock, of which the Holy Spirit has placed you in charge, to
shepherd the church of God, which he won for himself at the cost of his
life. I know that, after my departure, merciless wolves will get in
among you, who will not spare the flock; and from among yourselves, too,
people will arise, who will teach perversions of truth, so as to draw
away the disciples after them. Therefore, be on your guard, remembering
how for three years, night and day, I never ceased, even with tears, to
warn each one of you. And now I commend you to the Lord and to the
message of his love -- a message which has the power to build up your
characters, and to give you your place among all those who have become
Christ's people. I have never coveted anyone's gold or silver or
clothing. You, yourselves, know that these hands of mine provided not
only for my own wants, but for my companions also. I left nothing undone
to show you that, labouring as I laboured, you ought to help the weak,
and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how he said himself -- "It
is more blessed to give than to receive."' When Paul had finished
speaking, he knelt down and prayed with them all. All were in tears; and
throwing their arms round Paul's neck, they kissed him again and again,
grieving most of all over what he had said -- that they would never see
his face again. Then they escorted him to the ship.

     When we had torn ourselves away and had set sail, we ran before the
wind to Cos; the next day we came to Rhodes, and from there to Patara,
where we found a ship crossing to Phoenicia, and went on board and set
sail. After sighting Cyprus and leaving it on the left, we sailed to
Syria, and put into Tyre, where the ship was to discharge her cargo.
There we found the disciples and stayed a week with them. Speaking under
the influence of the Spirit, they warned Paul not to set foot in
Jerusalem. However, when we had come to the end of our visit, we went on
our way, all the disciples with their wives and children escorting us
out of the city. We knelt down on the beach, and prayed, and then said
goodbye to one another; after which we went on board, and they returned
home.
     After we had made the run from Tyre, we landed at Ptolemais, and
exchanged greetings with the followers there, and spent a day with them.
The next day we left, and reached Caesarea, where we went to the house
of Philip, the missionary, who was one of the Seven, and stayed with
him. He had four unmarried daughters, who had the gift of prophecy.
During our visit, which lasted several days, a prophet, named Agabus,
came down from Judea. He came to see us, and, taking Paul's belt, and
binding his own feet and hands with it, said, 'This is what the Holy
Spirit says -- "The man to whom this belt belongs will be bound like
this by the religious authorities in Jerusalem, and they will give him
up to the Gentiles".' When we heard that, we and the people of the place
began to entreat Paul not to go up to Jerusalem.
     It was then that Paul made the reply, 'Why are you weeping and
breaking my heart like this? For my part, I am ready not only to be
bound, but even to suffer death at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord
Jesus.' So, as he would not be persuaded, we said no more to him, only
adding -- 'The Lord's will be done.'

     At the end of our visit, we made our preparations, and started on
our way up to Jerusalem. Some of the disciples from Caesarea went with
us, and brought Mnason with them, a Cypriot disciple of long standing,
with whom we were to stay. On our arrival at Jerusalem, the followers of
the Lord there gave us a hearty welcome; and the next day Paul went with
us to see James, and all the church elders were present. After greeting
them, Paul related in detail all that God had done among the Gentiles
through his efforts; and, when they had heard it, they began praising
God, and said to Paul:
    'You see, brother, that those of our people who have become
believers in Christ may be numbered by tens of thousands, and they are
all naturally earnest in upholding the Jewish Law. Now they have heard
it said about you, that you teach all of our people in foreign countries
to forsake Moses, for you tell them not to circumcise their children or
even to observe Jewish customs. Well now, as they are certain to hear of
your arrival, do what we are going to suggest. We have four men here,
who have of their own accord put themselves under a vow. Join these men,
share their purification, and bear their expenses, so that they may
shave their heads; and then all will see that there is no truth in what
they have been told about you, but that, on the contrary, you yourself
rule your life in obedience to the Jewish Law. As to the Gentiles who
have become believers in Christ, we have sent our decision that they
should avoid food offered to idols, and blood, and the flesh of
strangled animals, and impurity.'
     Paul joined the men, and the next day shared their purification,
and went into the Temple, and gave notice of the expiration of the
period of purification when the usual offering should have been made on
behalf of each of them.

     But, just as the seven days were drawing to a close, some of the
Jewish people from Roman Asia caught sight of Paul in the Temple, and
caused great excitement among all the people present, by seizing Paul
and shouting, 'People of Israel! Help! This is the man who teaches
everyone everywhere against our people, our Law, and this place; and,
what is more, he has actually brought Greeks into the Temple and defiled
this sacred place.' (For they had previously seen Trophimus the Ephesian
in Paul's company in the city, and were under the belief that Paul had
taken him into the Temple.)
     The whole city was stirred, and the people quickly collected,
seized Paul, and dragged him out of the Temple, when the doors were
immediately shut. They were bent on killing him, when it was reported to
the officer commanding the garrison, that all Jerusalem was in
commotion. He instantly got together some officers and soldiers, and
charged down on the crowd, who, when they saw the commanding officer and
his soldiers, stopped beating Paul. Then he went up to Paul, arrested
him, ordered him to be doubly chained, and proceeded to inquire who he
was, and what he had been doing. Some of the crowd said one thing, and
some another; and, as he could get no definite reply because of the
uproar, he ordered Paul to be taken into the barracks. When Paul reached
the steps, he was actually being carried by the soldiers, owing to the
violence of the mob; for the people were following in a mass, shouting
out, 'Kill him!'
     Just as he was about to be taken into the Fort, Paul said to the
commanding officer, 'May I speak to you?'
     'Do you know Greek?' asked the commanding officer. 'Aren't you,
then, the Egyptian who some time ago raised an insurrection and led the
four thousand Bandits out into the wilderness?'
     'No,' said Paul, 'I am a Jew of Tarsus in Cilicia, a citizen of a
city of some note. I beg you to give me permission to speak to the
people.'
     The commanding officer gave his permission, and Paul, standing on
the steps, made signs with his hand to the people, and, when comparative
silence had been obtained, he said to them in Hebrew:  'Brothers and
fathers, listen to the defence which I am about to make.' When they
heard that he was speaking to them in Hebrew, they were still more
quiet; and Paul went on:
     'I am a Jew, from Tarsus in Cilicia, but I was brought up in this
city under the teaching of Gamaliel, and educated in accordance with the
strict system of our ancestral Law. I was as zealous in God's service as
any of you who are here today. In my persecution of this Way I did not
stop even at the taking of life. I put in chains, and imprisoned, men
and women alike -- And to that the high priest himself and all the
council of elders can testify. For I had letters of introduction from
them to our fellow Jews at Damascus, and I was on my way to that place,
to bring those whom I might find there prisoners to Jerusalem for
punishment. While I was still on my way, just as I was getting close to
Damascus, about midday, suddenly there flashed from the heavens a great
light all round me. I fell to the ground, and heard a voice saying to me
"Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?" "Who are you, Lord?" I
replied. Then the voice said "I am Jesus of Nazareth whom you are
persecuting." The men with me saw the light, but did not hear the
speaker's voice. Then I said "What am I to do, Lord?" "Get up and go
into Damascus," The Lord said to me, "and there you will be told all
that you have been appointed to do." In consequence of that dazzling
light I could not see, but my companions held me by the hand, until I
reached Damascus. There a man named Ananias, a strict observer of our
Law, well spoken of by all the Jewish inhabitants, came to see me.
Standing close to me, he said "Saul, my brother, recover your sight."
And then and there I recovered my sight and looked up at him. Then he
said "The God of our ancestors has appointed you to learn his will, and
to see the righteous one, and to hear words from his lips; for you will
be a witness for him to all the world of what you have just seen and
heard. And now why wait any longer, Be baptised at once, wash away your
sins, and invoke his name." After my return to Jerusalem, while I was
praying one day in the Temple, I fell into a trance, and saw Jesus
saying to me "Make haste and leave Jerusalem at once, because they will
not accept your testimony about me." "Lord," I answered, "these people
know that I used to imprison and scourge, in synagogue after synagogue,
those who believed in you; and, when the blood of your martyr, Stephen,
was being shed, I was myself standing by, approving of his death, and
took charge of the clothes of those who were murdering him." But Jesus
said to me "Go; for I will send you to the Gentiles far away".'
     Up to this point the people had been listening to Paul, but at
these words they called out, 'Kill him! A fellow like this ought not to
have been allowed to live!' As they were shouting, tearing off their
clothes, and throwing dust in the air, the commanding officer ordered
Paul to be taken into the Fort, and directed that he should be examined
under the lash so that he might find out the reason for their outcry
against him.
     But just as they had tied him up to be scourged, Paul said to the
centurion standing near, 'Is it legal for you to scourge a Roman
citizen, unconvicted?' On hearing this, the centurion went and reported
it to the commanding officer. 'Do you know what you are doing?' he said.
'This man is a Roman citizen.' So the commanding officer went up to Paul
and said, 'Tell me, are you a Roman citizen?'
     'Yes,' replied Paul. 'I had to pay a heavy price for my position as
citizen,' said the officer. 'I am one by birth,' rejoined Paul.
     The men who were to have examined Paul immediately drew back, and
the officer, finding that Paul was a Roman citizen, was alarmed at
having put him in chains.

     On the next day the commanding officer, wishing to find out the
real reason why Paul was denounced by the Jewish leaders, had his chains
taken off, and directed the chief priests and the whole of the High
Council to assemble, and then took Paul down and brought him before
them.  Paul fixed his eyes on the Council, and began:
    'Brothers, for my part, I have always ordered my life before God,
with a clear conscience, up to this very day.' At this, the high priest
Ananias ordered the men standing near to strike him on the mouth; Paul
turned to him and said:
    'God will strike you, you whitewashed wall! Are you sitting there to
try me in accordance with law, and yet, in defiance of law, order me to
be struck?' The people standing near said to Paul, 'Do you know that you
are insulting God's high priest?'
     'I did not know, brothers, that it was the high priest,' said Paul,
'for scripture says --

     "Of the ruler of your people you should speak no ill".'
 Noticing that some of those present were Sadducees and others
Pharisees, Paul called out in the Council, 'Brothers, I am a Pharisee
and a son of Pharisees. It is on the question of hope for the dead and
of their resurrection that I am on my trial.'
     As soon as he said this, a dispute arose between the Pharisees and
the Sadducees; and there was a sharp division of opinion among those
present. (For Sadducees say there is no such thing as a resurrection,
and that there is neither angel nor spirit, while Pharisees believe in
both.) So a great uproar ensued, and some of the Teachers of the Law
belonging to the Pharisees' party stood up and hotly protested, 'We find
nothing whatever wrong in this man. Suppose a spirit did speak to him,
or an angel...' The dispute was becoming so violent, that the commanding
officer, fearing that Paul would be torn in pieces between them, ordered
the Guard to go down and rescue him from them, and take him into the
Fort.
     That night the Lord came and stood by Paul, and said, 'Courage! You
have borne witness for me in Jerusalem and you must bear witness in Rome
also.' In the morning some Jewish men combined together, and took an
oath that they would not eat or drink until they had killed Paul. There
were more than forty in the plot; and they went to the chief priests and
the elders, and said, 'We have taken a solemn oath not to touch food
until we have killed Paul. So we want you now, with the consent of the
Council, to suggest to the commanding officer that he should bring Paul
down before you, as though you intended to go more fully into his case;
but, before he comes here, we will be ready to make away with him.'
     However, the son of Paul's sister, hearing of the plot, went to the
Fort, and on being admitted, told Paul about it. Paul called one of the
garrison centurion and asked him to take the young man to the commanding
officer, as he had something to tell him. The centurion went with him to
the commanding officer, and said, 'The prisoner Paul called me and asked
me to bring this young man to you, as he has something to tell you.'
     The commanding officer took the young man by the hand, and,
stepping aside, asked what it was he had to tell him. 'Some men have
agreed,' he answered, 'to ask you to bring Paul down before the Council
tomorrow, on the plea of your making further inquiry into his case. But
do not let them persuade you, for more than forty of them are lying in
wait for him, who have taken an oath that they will not eat or drink,
until they have made away with him; and they are at this very moment in
readiness, counting on your promise.' The commanding officer then
dismissed the young man, cautioning him not to mention to anybody that
he had given him that information. Then he called two Captains, and
ordered them to have two hundred soldiers ready to go to Caesarea, as
well as seventy troopers and two hundred lancers, by nine o'clock that
night, and to have horses ready for Paul to ride, so that they might
take him safely to Felix, the Governor. He also wrote a letter along
these lines:

     "Claudius Lysias sends his compliments to His Excellency Felix the
Governor. The man whom I send with this had been seized by some Jews,
and was on the point of being killed by them, when I came upon them with
the force under my command, and rescued him, as I learned that he was a
Roman citizen. Wanting to know exactly the ground of the charges they
made against him, I brought him before their Council, when I found that
their charges were connected with questions of their own Law, and that
there was nothing alleged involving either death or imprisonment.
Having, however, information of a plot against the man, which was about
to be put into execution, I am sending him to you at once, and I have
also directed his accusers to prosecute him before you."
 The soldiers, in accordance with their orders, took charge of Paul and
conducted him by night to Antipatris; and on the next day, leaving the
troopers to go on with him, they returned to the Fort. On arriving at
Caesarea, the troopers delivered the letter to the Governor, and brought
Paul before him. As soon as Felix had read the letter, he enquired to
what province Paul belonged, and, learning that he came from Cilicia, he
said, 'I will hear all you have to say as soon as your accusers have
arrived.' And he ordered Paul to be kept under guard in Herod's
Government house.

     Five days afterwards the high priest Ananias came down with some of
the elders and a barrister named Tertullus. They laid an information
with the Governor against Paul; and, when the hearing came on, Tertullus
began his speech for the prosecution. 'We owe it to your Excellency,' he
said, 'that we are enjoying profound peace, and we owe it to your
foresight that this nation is constantly securing reforms -- advantages
which we very gratefully accept at all times and places. But -- not to
be tedious -- I beg you, with your accustomed fairness, to listen to a
brief statement of our case. We have found this man a public pest; he is
one who stirs up disputes among our people all the world over, and is a
ringleader of the Nazarene heretics. He even attempted to desecrate the
Temple itself, but we caught him; {  (24:7)  Some later manuscripts add:
We wanted to judge him according to our law. But Lysias the commanding
officer came and took him out of our hands by force, ordering his
accusers to come before you. } and you will be able, by examining him on
all these points, to satisfy yourself as to the charges which we are
bringing against him.'
     The Jewish crowd also joined in the attack and bore out his
statements. On a sign from the Governor, Paul made this reply:
    'Knowing, as I do, for how many years you have acted as judge to
this nation, it is with confidence that I undertake my own defence. For
you can easily verify that it is not more than twelve days ago that I
went up to worship at Jerusalem, where my prosecutors never found me
holding discussions with anyone, or causing a crowd to collect -- either
in the Temple, or in the synagogues, or about the city; and they cannot
establish the charges which they are now making against me. This,
however, I do acknowledge to you, that it is as a believer in the Way
which they call heretical, that I worship the God of my ancestors. At
the same time, I believe everything that is in accordance with the Law
and that is written in the prophets; and I have a hope that rests in God
-- a hope which they also cherish -- that there will one day be a
resurrection of good and bad alike. This being so, I strive at all times
to keep my conscience clear before both God and people. After some
years' absence I had come to bring charitable gifts to my nation, and to
make offerings; and it was while engaged in this that they found me in
the Temple, after completing a period of purification, but not with any
crowd or disorder. There were, however, some Jews from Roman Asia who
ought to have been here before you, and to have made any charge that
they may have against me -- Or else let my opponents here say what they
found wrong in me when I was before the Council, except as to the one
sentence that I shouted out as I stood among them -- "It is about the
resurrection of the dead that I am on my trial before you today".'
     Felix, however, adjourned the case -- though he had a fairly
accurate knowledge of all that concerned the Way -- with the promise,
'When Lysias, the commanding officer, comes down, I will give my
decision in your case.' So he gave orders to the centurion in charge of
Paul to keep him in custody, but to relax the regulations, and not to
prevent any of his personal friends from attending to his wants.
     Some days later Felix came with his wife Drusilla, who was Jewish,
and, sending for Paul, listened to what he had to say about faith in
Christ Jesus. But, while Paul was speaking at length about
righteousness, self-control, and the coming judgment, Felix became
terrified, and interrupted him -- 'Go for the present, but, when I find
an opportunity, I will send for you again.' He was hoping, too, for a
bribe from Paul, and so he used to send for him frequently and talk with
him. But, after the lapse of two years, Felix was succeeded by Porcius
Festus; and, wishing to gain popularity with the Jewish leaders, he left
Paul a prisoner.

     Three days after Festus had arrived in his province, he left
Caesarea and went up to Jerusalem. There the chief priests and the
leading men among the Jews laid an information before him against Paul,
and asked a favour of him, to Paul's injury -- to have Paul brought to
Jerusalem. All the while they were plotting to make away with him on the
road. But Festus answered that Paul was in prison at Caesarea, and that
he himself would be leaving for that place shortly.
     'So let the influential men among you,' he said, 'go down with me,
and if there is anything amiss in the man, charge him formally with it.'
After staying among them some eight or ten days, Festus went down to
Caesarea. The next day he took his seat on the Bench, and ordered Paul
to be brought before him. On Paul's appearance, the Jewish leaders who
had come down from Jerusalem surrounded him, and made many serious
charges, which they failed to establish. Paul's answer to the charge was
-- "I have not committed any offence against the Jewish Law, or the
Temple, or the Emperor." But, as Festus wished to gain popularity with
the Jews, he interrupted Paul with the question, 'Are you willing to go
up to Jerusalem and be tried on these charges before me there?'
     'No,' replied Paul, 'I am standing at the Emperor's court, where I
ought to be tried. I have not wronged the Jews, as you yourself are well
aware. If, however, I am breaking the law and have committed any offence
deserving death, I do not ask to escape the penalty; but, if there is
nothing in the accusations of these people, no one has the power to give
me up to them. I appeal to the Emperor.'
     Festus, after conferring with his Council, answered, 'You have
appealed to the Emperor; to the Emperor you will go.'
     Some days later King Agrippa and Bernice came down to Caesarea, and
paid a visit of congratulation to Festus; and, as they were staying
there for several days, Festus laid Paul's case before the king. 'There
is a man here,' he said, 'left a prisoner by Felix, about whom, when I
came to Jerusalem, the Jewish chief priest and the elders laid an
information, demanding judgment against him. My answer to them was, that
it was not the practice of Romans to give up anyone to their accusers
until the accused had met them face to face, and had also had an
opportunity of answering the charges brought against them. So they met
here, and without loss of time I took my seat on the Bench the very next
day, and ordered the man to be brought before me. But, when his accusers
came forward, they brought no charge of wrongdoing such as I had
expected; but I found that there were certain questions in dispute
between them about their own religion, and about some dead man called
Jesus, whom Paul declared to be alive. And, as I was at a loss how to
enquire into questions of this kind, I asked Paul if he were willing to
go up to Jerusalem, and be put on trial there. Paul, however, appealed
to have his case reserved for the consideration of his August Majesty,
so I ordered him to be detained in custody, until I could send him to
the Emperor.'
     'I should like to hear this man myself,' Agrippa said to Festus.
     'You will hear him tomorrow,' Festus answered.
     So the next day, when Agrippa and Bernice had come in full state
and had entered the Audience Chamber, with the superior officers and the
principal people of the city, by the order of Festus Paul was brought
before them. Then Festus said, 'King Agrippa, and all here present, you
see before you the man about whom the whole Jewish people have applied
to me, both at Jerusalem and here, loudly asserting that he ought not to
be allowed to live. I found, however, that he had not done anything
deserving death; so, as he had himself appealed to his August Majesty, I
decided to send him. But I have nothing definite to write about him to
my Imperial Master; and for that reason I have brought him before you
all, and especially before you, King Agrippa, that, after examining him,
I may have something to write. For it seems to me absurd to send a
prisoner, without at the same time stating the charges made against
him.'
     Turning to Paul, Agrippa said, 'You are at liberty to speak for
yourself.' Then Paul stretched out his hand and began his defence. 'I
have been congratulating myself, King Agrippa,' he said, 'that it is
before you that I have to make my defence today, with regard to all the
charges brought against me by my own people, especially as you are so
well-versed in all the customs and questions of the Jewish world. I beg
you therefore to give me a patient hearing. My life, then, from youth
upwards, was passed, from the very first, among my own nation, and in
Jerusalem, and is within the knowledge of all Jews; and they have always
known -- if they choose to give evidence -- that, in accordance with the
very strictest form of our religion, I lived a true Pharisee. Even now,
it is because of my hope in the promise given by God to our ancestors
that I stand here on my trial -- A promise which our twelve tribes, by
earnest service night and day, hope to see fulfilled. It is for this
hope, your Majesty, that I am accused -- and by Jews themselves! Why do
you all hold it incredible that God should raise the dead? I myself, it
is true, once thought it my duty to oppose in every way the name of
Jesus of Nazareth; and I actually did so at Jerusalem. Acting on the
authority of the chief priests, I myself threw many of the people of
Christ into prison, and, when it was proposed to put them to death, I
gave my vote for it. Time after time, in every synagogue, I tried by
punishments to force them to blaspheme. So frantic was I against them,
that I pursued them even to towns beyond our borders. It was while I was
traveling to Damascus on an errand of this kind, entrusted with full
powers by the chief priests, that at midday, your Majesty, I saw right
in my path, coming from the heavens, a light brighter than the glare of
the sun, which shone all round me and those traveling with me. We all
fell to the ground, and then I heard a voice saying to me in Hebrew --
"Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me? By kicking against the goad you
are punishing yourself." "Who are you, Lord?" I asked. And the Lord
said, "I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting; but get up and stand
upright; for I have appeared to you in order to appoint you a servant
and a witness of those revelations of me which you have already had, and
of those in which I will yet appear to you, since I am choosing you out
from your own people and from the Gentiles, to whom I now send you, to
open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the
power of Satan to God; so that they may receive pardon for their sins,
and a place among those who have become God's people, by faith in me."
After that, King Agrippa, I did not fail to obey the heavenly vision; on
the contrary, first to those at Damascus and Jerusalem, and then through
the whole of Judea, and to the Gentiles as well, I began to preach
repentance and conversion to God, and a life befitting that repentance.
This is why some men seized me in the Temple, and made attempts on my
life. However I have received help from God to this very day, and so
stand here, and bear my testimony to high and low alike -- without
adding a word to what the prophets, as well as Moses, declared should
happen -- That the Christ must suffer, and that, by rising from the
dead, he was destined to be the first to bring news of light, not only
to our nation, but also to the Gentiles.'
     While Paul was making this defence, Festus called out loudly, 'You
are mad, Paul; your great learning is driving you mad.'
     'I am not mad, your Excellency,' he replied. 'On the contrary, the
statements that I am making are true and sober. Indeed, the king knows
about these matters, so I speak before him without constraint. I am sure
that there is nothing whatever of what I have been telling him that has
escaped his attention; for all this has not been done in a corner. King
Agrippa, do you believe the prophets? I know you do.'
     But Agrippa said to Paul, 'You are soon trying to make a Christian
of me!'
     'Whether it is soon or late,' answered Paul, 'I pray to God that
not only you, but all who are listening to me, might today become just
what I am myself -- except for these chains!' Then the king rose, with
the Governor and Bernice and those who had been sitting with them, and,
after retiring, discussed the case among themselves. 'There is nothing,'
they said, 'deserving death or imprisonment in this man's conduct'; and,
speaking to Festus, Agrippa added, 'The man might have been discharged,
if he had not appealed to the Emperor.'

     As it was decided that we were to sail to Italy, Paul and some
other prisoners were put in charge of a centurion of the Augustan Guard,
named Julius. We went on board a ship from Adramyttium, which was on the
point of sailing to the ports along the coast of Roman Asia, and put to
sea. Aristarchus, a Macedonian from Thessalonica, went with us. The next
day we put in to Sidon, where Julius treated Paul in a friendly manner,
and allowed him to go to see his friends and receive their hospitality.
Putting to sea again, we sailed under the lee of Cyprus, because the
wind was against us; and, after crossing the sea of Cilicia and
Pamphylia, we reached Myra in Lycia. There the Roman officer found an
Alexandrian ship on her way to Italy, and put us on board of her. For
several days our progress was slow, and it was only with difficulty that
we arrived off Cnidus. As the wind was still unfavourable when we came
off Cape Salmone, we sailed under the lee of Crete, and with difficulty,
by keeping close in shore, we reached a place called "Fair Havens," near
which was the town of Lasea.
     This had taken a considerable time, and sailing was already
dangerous, for the Fast was already over; and so Paul gave this warning.
'My friends,' he said, 'I see that this voyage will be attended with
injury and much damage, not only to the cargo and the ship, but to our
own lives also.'
     The Roman officer, however, was more influenced by the captain and
the owner than by what was said by Paul. And, as the harbour was not a
suitable one to winter in, the majority were in favour of continuing the
voyage, in hope of being able to reach Phoenix, and winter there.
Phoenix was a Cretan harbour, open to the north-east and south-east. So,
when a light wind sprang up from the south, thinking that they had found
their opportunity, they weighed anchor and kept along the coast of
Crete, close in shore. But shortly afterwards a hurricane came down on
us off the land -- a north-easter, as it is called. The ship was caught
by it and was unable to keep her head to the wind, so we had to give way
and let her drive before it. Running under the lee of a small island
called Cauda, we only just managed to secure the ship's boat, and, after
hoisting it on board, the men frapped the ship. But, afraid of being
driven on to the Syrtis Sands, they lowered the yard, and then drifted.
So violently were we tossed about by the storm, that the next day they
began throwing the cargo overboard, and, on the following day, threw out
the ship's tackle with their own hands. As neither sun nor stars were
visible for several days, and, as the gale still continued severe, all
hope of our being saved was at last abandoned.
     It was then, when they had gone a long time without food, that Paul
came forward, and said, 'My friends, you should have listened to me, and
not have sailed from Crete and so incurred this injury and damage. Yet,
even as things are, I beg you not to lose courage, for there will not be
a single life lost among you -- only the ship. For last night an angel
of the God to whom I belong, and whom I serve, stood by me, and said --
"Have no fear, Paul; you must appear before the Emperor, and God himself
has given you the lives of all your fellow voyagers." Therefore,
courage, my friends! For I believe God, that everything will happen
exactly as I have been told. We will, however, have to be driven on some
island.'
     It was now the fourteenth night of the storm, and we were drifting
about in the Adriatic Sea, when, about midnight, the sailors began to
suspect that they were drawing near land. So they took soundings, and
found twenty fathoms of water. After waiting a little, they took
soundings again, and found fifteen fathoms. Then, as they were afraid of
our being driven on some rocky coast, they let go four anchors from the
stern, and longed for daylight. The sailors wanted to leave the ship,
and had lowered the boat, on pretence of running out anchors from the
bows, when Paul said to the Roman officer and his men, 'Unless the
sailors remain on board, you cannot be saved.' So the soldiers cut the
ropes which held the boat, and let her drift away. In the interval
before daybreak Paul kept urging them all to take something to eat.
    'It is a fortnight today,' he said, 'that, owing to your anxiety,
you have gone without food, taking nothing. So I beg you to take
something to eat; your safety depends on it, for not one of you will
lose even a hair of his head.' With these words he took some bread, and,
after saying the thanksgiving to God before them all, broke it in
pieces, and began to eat; and the men all felt cheered and had something
to eat themselves. There were about seventy-six of us on board, all
told. After satisfying their hunger, they further lightened the ship by
throwing the grain into the sea. When daylight came, they could not make
out what land it was, but, observing a creek in which there was a beach,
they consulted as to whether they could run the ship safely into it.
Then they cast off, and abandoned the anchors, and at the same time
unlashed the gear of the steering oars, hoisted the foresail to the
wind, and made for the beach. They got, however, into a kind of channel,
and there ran the ship aground. The bows stuck fast and could not be
moved, while the stern began breaking up under the strain. The advice of
the soldiers was that the prisoners should be killed, so that none of
them could swim away and make their escape. But the Roman officer,
anxious to save Paul, prevented their carrying out their intention, and
ordered that those who could swim should be the first to jump into the
sea and try to reach the shore; and that the rest should follow, some on
planks, and others on different pieces of the ship. In these various
ways everyone managed to get safely ashore.

     When we were all safe, we found that the island was called Malta.
The island's people showed us marked kindness, for they lit a fire and
took us all under shelter, because it had come on to rain and was cold.
Paul had gathered a quantity of dry sticks and laid them on the fire,
when a poisonous snake, driven out by the heat, fastened on his hand.
When the islanders saw the creature hanging from his hand, they said to
one another, 'Evidently this man is a murderer, for though he has been
saved from the sea, Justice has not allowed him to live.' However, Paul
shook the creature off into the fire and took no harm. The islanders
were expecting inflammation to set in, or that he would suddenly fall
dead; but, after waiting for a long time, and seeing that there was
nothing amiss with him, they changed their minds and said that he was a
God.
     In that region there was an estate belonging to the Governor of the
island, whose name was Publius. He took us up to his house, and for
three days entertained us most courteously. It happened that the father
of Publius was lying ill of fever and dysentery. So Paul went to see
him; and, after praying, he placed his hands on him and cured him. After
this, all the people in the island who had any illness came to Paul, and
were cured. They also presented us with many gifts, and when we set sail
they put supplies of necessaries on board.

     After three months, we set sail in a ship that had wintered in the
island. She was an Alexandrian vessel, and had the Twin sons of Zeus for
her figure-head. We put in at Syracuse and stayed there three days, and
from there we worked to windward and so got to Rhegium. A day later a
south wind sprang up and took us to Puteoli in two days. There we found
some of the Lord's followers, and were urged to stay a week with them;
after which we went on to Rome. The followers there had heard about us,
and came out as far as the Market of Appius and the Three Taverns to
meet us. At sight of them Paul thanked God and was much cheered. On our
reaching Rome, Paul was allowed to live by himself, except for the
soldier who was in charge of him.

     Three days after our arrival, Paul invited the leading Jews to meet
him; and, when they came, he said, 'Brothers, although I had done
nothing hostile to the interests of our nation or to our ancestral
customs, yet I was sent from Jerusalem as a prisoner, and handed over to
the Romans. The Romans, when they had examined me, were ready to release
me, because there was nothing in my conduct deserving death. But, as the
Jewish leaders opposed my release, I was compelled to appeal to the
Emperor -- not, indeed, that I had any charge to make against my own
nation. This, then, is my reason for urging you to come to see me and
talk with me; because it is for the sake of the hope of Israel that I am
here in chains.'
     'We,' was their reply, 'have not had any letter about you from
Judea, nor have any of our fellow Jews come and reported or said
anything bad about you. But we will be glad to hear from you what your
views are, for, with regard to this sect, we are well aware that it is
spoken against on all sides.'
     They then fixed a day with him, and came to the place where he was
staying, in even larger numbers, when Paul proceeded to lay the subject
before them. He bore his testimony to the kingdom of God, and tried to
convince them about Jesus, by arguments drawn from the Law of Moses and
from the prophets -- speaking from morning until evening. Some were
inclined to accept what he said; others, however, rejected it. So, as
they disagreed among themselves, they began to disperse, Paul adding
only --
    'True, indeed, was the declaration made by the Holy Spirit, through
the prophet Isaiah to your ancestors --

     Go to this nation and say:
         You will hear with your ears without ever understanding,
             and, though you have eyes, you will see without ever
perceiving.
         For the mind of this nation has grown dense,
             and their ears are dull of hearing,
             their eyes also have they closed;
         otherwise some day they might see with their eyes,
         and with their ears they might hear,
         and in their mind they might understand, and might turn --
             and I might heal them.
 Understand, then, that this salvation of God was sent for the Gentiles;
and they will listen.' {  (28:29)  Some later manuscripts add: After he
said these things the Jews left, all the while engaging in a heated
debate among themselves. }
     For two whole years Paul stayed in a house which he rented for
himself, welcoming all who came to see him, proclaiming the kingdom of
God, and teaching about the Lord Jesus Christ, with perfect
fearlessness, unhindered.

                          PAUL'S LETTER TO THE
                                 ROMANS


*Introduction*

     From Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, who has been called to become
an apostle, and has been set apart to tell God's good news. This good
news God promised long ago through his prophets in the sacred
scriptures, concerning his Son, Jesus Christ, our Lord; who, as to his
human nature, was descended from David, but, as to the spirit of
holiness within him, was miraculously designated Son of God by his
resurrection from the dead. Through him we received the gift of the
apostolic office, to win submission to the faith among all nations for
the glory of his name. And among these nations are you -- you who have
been called to belong to Jesus Christ.
     To all in Rome who are dear to God and have been called to become
Christ's people, may God, our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ bless
you and give you peace.

     First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, because the
report of your faith is spreading throughout the world. God, to whom I
offer the worship of my soul as I tell the goodness of his Son, is my
witness how constantly I mention you when I pray, asking that, if he be
willing, I may some day at last find the way open to visit you. For I
long to see you, in order to impart to you some spiritual gift and so
give you fresh strength -- or rather that both you and I may find
encouragement in each other's faith. I want you to know, my friends,
that I have many times intended coming to see you -- but until now I
have been prevented -- that I might find among you some fruit of my
labours, as I have already among the other nations.

*Faith the Ground of Acceptance*

     I have a duty to both the Greek and the barbarian, to both the
cultured and the ignorant. And so, for my part, I am ready to tell the
good news to you also who are in Rome.
     For I am not ashamed of the good news; it is the power of God which
brings salvation to everyone who believes, to the Jew first, but also to
the Greek. For in it there is a revelation of the divine righteousness
resulting from faith and leading on to faith; as scripture says --
"Through faith the righteous will find life."
     So, too, there is a revelation from heaven of the divine wrath
against every form of ungodliness and wickedness on the part of those
people who, by their wicked lives, are stifling the truth. This is so,
because what can be known about God is plain to them; for God himself
has made it plain. For ever since the creation of the universe God's
invisible attributes -- his everlasting power and divinity -- are to be
seen and studied in his works, so that people have no excuse; because,
although they learned to know God, yet they did not offer him as God
either praise or thanksgiving. Their speculations about him proved
futile, and their undiscerning minds were darkened. Professing to be
wise, they showed themselves fools; and they transformed the glory of
the immortal God into the likeness of mortal humans, and of birds, and
beasts, and reptiles.
     Therefore God abandoned them to impurity, letting them follow the
cravings of their hearts, until they dishonoured their own bodies; for
they had substituted a lie for the truth about God, and had reverenced
and worshiped created things more than the Creator, who is to be praised
for ever. Amen. That, I say, is why God abandoned them to degrading
passions. Even the women among them perverted the natural use of their
bodies to the unnatural; while the men, disregarding that for which
women were intended by nature, were consumed with passion for one
another. Men indulged in vile practices with men, and incurred in their
own persons the inevitable penalty for their perverseness.
     Then, as they would not keep God before their minds, God abandoned
them to depraved thoughts, so that they did all kinds of shameful
things. They revelled in every form of wickedness, evil, greed, vice.
Their lives were full of envy, murder, quarrelling, treachery, malice.
They became back-biters, slanderers, impious, insolent, boastful. They
devised new sins. They disobeyed their parents. They were undiscerning,
untrustworthy, without natural affection or pity. Well aware of God's
decree, that those who do such things deserve to die, not only are they
guilty of them themselves, but they even applaud those who do them.
     Therefore you have nothing to say in your own defence, whoever you
are who set yourself up as a judge. In judging others you condemn
yourself, for you who set yourself up as a judge do the very same
things. And we know that God's judgment falls unerringly on those who do
them. You who judge those that do such things and yet are yourself
guilty of them -- do you suppose that you of all people will escape
God's judgment? Or do you think lightly of his abundant kindness,
patience, and forbearance, not realising that his kindness is meant to
lead you to repentance? Hard-hearted and impenitent as you are, you are
storing up for yourself wrath on the day of wrath, when God's justice as
a judge will be revealed; for he will give to everyone what their
actions deserve. To those who, by perseverance in doing good, aim at
glory, honour, and all that is imperishable, he will give immortal life;
while as to those who are factious, and disobedient to truth but
obedient to evil, wrath and anger, distress and despair, will fall on
every human being who persists in wrongdoing -- on the Jew first, but
also on the Greek. But there will be glory, honour, and peace for
everyone who does right -- for the Jew first, but also for the Greek,
since God shows no partiality. All who, when they sin, are without Law
will also perish without Law; while all who, when they sin, are under
Law, will be judged as being under Law. It is not those who hear the
words of a Law that are righteous before God, but it is those who obey
it that will be pronounced righteous. When Gentiles, who have no Law, do
instinctively what the Law requires, they, though they have no Law, are
a Law to themselves; for they show the demands of the Law written on
their hearts; their consciences corroborating it, while in their
thoughts they argue either in self-accusation or, it may be, in self-
defence -- on the day when God passes judgment on people's inmost lives,
as the good news that I tell declares that he will do through Christ
Jesus.
     But, perhaps, you bear the name of "Jew," and are relying on Law,
and boast of belonging to God, and understand his will, and, having been
carefully instructed from the Law, have learned to appreciate the finer
moral distinctions. Perhaps you are confident that you are a guide to
the blind, a light to those who are in the dark, an instructor of the
unintelligent, and a teacher of the childish, because in the Law you
possess the outline of all knowledge and truth. Why, then, you teacher
of others, don't you teach yourself? Do you preach against stealing, and
yet steal? Do you forbid adultery, and yet commit adultery? Do you
loathe idols, and yet plunder temples? Boasting, as you do, of your Law,
do you dishonour God by breaking the Law? For, as scripture says -- "The
Gentiles insult God's name because of you"! Circumcision has its value,
if you are obeying the Law. But, if you are a breaker of the Law, your
circumcision is no better than uncircumcision. If, then, an
uncircumcised man pays regard to the requirements of the Law, won't he,
although not circumcised, be regarded by God as if he were? Indeed, the
person who, owing to his birth, remains uncircumcised, and yet
scrupulously obeys the Law, will condemn you, who, for all your written
Law and your circumcision, are yet a breaker of the Law. For a man who
is only a Jew outwardly is not a real Jew; nor is outward bodily
circumcision real circumcision. The real Jew is the person who is a Jew
in soul; and the real circumcision is the circumcision of the heart, a
spiritual and not a literal thing. Such a person wins praise from God,
though not from people.
     What is the advantage, then, of being a Jew? Or what is the good of
circumcision? Great in every way. First of all, because the Jews were
entrusted with God's utterances. What follows then? Some, no doubt,
showed a want of faith; but will their want of faith make God break
faith? Heaven forbid! God must prove true, though everyone prove a liar!
As scripture says of God -- "That you may be pronounced righteous in
what you say, and gain your cause when people would judge you."
     But what if our wrongdoing makes God's righteousness all the
clearer? Will God be wrong in inflicting punishment? (I can but speak as
a person.) Heaven forbid! Otherwise how can God judge the world?
     But, if my falsehood redounds to the glory of God, by making his
truthfulness more apparent, why am I like others, still condemned as a
sinner? Why should we not say -- as some people slanderously assert that
we do say -- "Let us do evil that good may come"? The condemnation of
such people is indeed just!
     What follows, then? Are we Jews in any way superior to others? Not
at all. Our indictment against both Jews and Greeks was that all alike
were in subjection to sin. As scripture says --

     "There is not even one who is righteous,
         not one who understands,
         not one who is searching for God!
     They have all gone astray;
         they have one and all become depraved;
             there is no one who is doing good -- no, not one!"
     "Their throats are like opened graves;
         they deceive with their tongues."
     "The venom of snakes lies behind their lips,"
         "And their mouths are full of bitter curses."
     "Swift are their feet to shed blood.
     Distress and trouble dog their steps,
         and the path of peace they do not know."
             "The fear of God is not before their eyes."


     Now we know that everything said in the Law is addressed to those
who are under its authority, in order that every mouth may be closed,
and to bring the whole world under God's judgment. For no human being
will be pronounced righteous before God as the result of obedience to
Law; for it is Law that shows what sin is.
     But now, quite apart from Law, the divine righteousness stands
revealed, and to it the Law and the prophets bear witness -- the divine
righteousness which is bestowed, through faith in Jesus Christ, on all,
without distinction, who believe in him. For all have sinned, and all
fall short of God's glorious ideal, but, in his loving kindness, are
being freely pronounced righteous through the deliverance found in
Christ Jesus. For God set him before the world, to be, by the shedding
of his blood, a means of reconciliation through faith. And this God did
to prove his righteousness, and because, in his forbearance, he had
passed over the sins that people had previously committed; as a proof, I
repeat, at the present time, of his own righteousness, that he might be
righteous in our eyes, and might pronounce righteous the person who
takes their stand on faith in Jesus.
     What, then, becomes of our boasting? It is excluded. By what sort
of Law? A Law requiring obedience? No, a Law requiring faith.
     For we conclude that a person is pronounced righteous on the ground
of faith, quite apart from obedience to Law. Or can it be that God is
the God only of the Jews? Isn't he also the God of the Gentiles? Yes, of
the Gentiles also, since there is only one God, and he will pronounce
those who are circumcised righteous as the result of faith, and also
those who are uncircumcised on their showing the same faith.
     Do we, then, use this faith to abolish Law? Heaven forbid! No, we
establish Law.
     What then, it may be asked, are we to say about Abraham, the
ancestor of our nation? If he was pronounced righteous as the result of
obedience, then he has something to boast of. Yes, but not before God.
For what are the words of scripture? "Abraham had faith in God, and his
faith was regarded by God as righteousness." Now wages are regarded as
due to the person who works, not as a favour, but as a debt; while, as
for the person who does not rely on their obedience, but has faith in
him who can pronounce the godless righteous, their faith is regarded by
God as righteousness.
     In precisely the same way David speaks of the blessing pronounced
on the person who is regarded by God as righteous apart from actions --
"Blessed are those whose wrongdoings have been forgiven and over whose
sins a veil has been drawn! Blessed the man whom the Lord will never
regard as sinful!" Is this blessing, then, pronounced on the circumcised
only or on the uncircumcised as well? We say that -- "Abraham's faith
was regarded by God as righteousness." Under what circumstances, then,
did this take place? After his circumcision or before it? Not after, but
before. And it was as a sign of this that he received the rite of
circumcision -- to show the righteousness due to the faith of an
uncircumcised man -- in order that he might be the father of all who
have faith in God even when uncircumcised, so that they also may be
regarded by God as righteous; as well as father of the circumcised -- to
those who are not only circumcised, but who also follow our father
Abraham in that faith which he had while still uncircumcised. For the
promise that he should inherit the world did not come to Abraham or his
descendants through Law, but through the righteousness due to faith. If
those who take their stand on Law are to inherit the world, then faith
is robbed of its meaning and the promise comes to nothing! Law entails
punishment; but, where no Law exists, no breach of it is possible. That
is why everything is made to depend on faith: so that everything may be
God's gift, and in order that the fulfilment of the promise may be made
certain for all Abraham's descendants -- not only for those who take
their stand on the Law, but also for those who take their stand on the
faith of Abraham. (He is the father of us all; as scripture says -- "I
have made you the father of many nations.") And this they do in the
sight of that God in whom Abraham had faith, and who gives life to the
dead, and speaks of what does not yet exist as if it did. With no ground
for hope, Abraham, sustained by hope, put faith in God; in order that,
in fulfilment of the words -- "So many will your descendants be," he
might become "the father of many nations." Though he was nearly a
hundred years old, yet his faith did not fail him, even when he thought
of his own body, then utterly worn out, and remembered that Sarah was
past bearing children. He was not led by want of faith to doubt God's
promise. On the contrary, his faith gave him strength; and he praised
God, in the firm conviction that what God has promised he is also able
to carry out. And therefore his faith "was regarded as righteousness."
Now these words -- "it was regarded as righteousness" -- were not
written with reference to Abraham only; but also with reference to us.
Our faith, too, will be regarded by God in the same light, if we have
faith in him who raised Jesus, our Lord, from the dead; for Jesus was
given up to death to atone for our offences, and was raised to life that
we might be pronounced righteous.
     Therefore, having been pronounced righteous as the result of faith,
let us enjoy peace with God through Jesus Christ, our Lord. It is
through him that, by reason of our faith, we have obtained admission to
that place in God's favour in which we now stand. So let us exult in our
hope of attaining God's glorious ideal. And not only that, but let us
also exult in our troubles; for we know that trouble develops endurance,
and endurance strength of character, and strength of character hope, and
that hope never disappoints. For the love of God has filled our hearts
through the Holy Spirit which was given us; seeing that, while we were
still powerless, Christ, in God's good time, died on behalf of the
godless. Even for an upright person scarcely anyone will die. For a
really good person perhaps someone might even dare to die. But God puts
his love for us beyond all doubt by the fact that Christ died on our
behalf while we were still sinners. Much more, then, now that we have
been pronounced righteous by virtue of the shedding of his blood, will
we be saved through him from the wrath of God. For if, when we were
God's enemies, we were reconciled to him through the death of his Son,
much more, now that we have become reconciled, will we be saved by
virtue of Christ's life. And not only that, but we exult in God, through
Jesus Christ, our Lord, through whom we have now obtained this
reconciliation.
     Therefore, just as sin came into the world through one man, and
through sin came death; so, also, death spread to all humanity, because
every person has sinned. Even before the time of the Law there was sin
in the world; but sin cannot be charged against someone where no Law
exists. Yet, from Adam to Moses, death reigned even over those whose sin
was not a breach of a law, as Adam's was. And Adam foreshadows the one
to come. But there is a contrast between Adam's offence and God's
gracious gift. For, if by reason of the offence of the one man the whole
human race died, far more were the loving kindness of God, and the gift
given in the loving kindness of the one man, Jesus Christ, lavished on
the whole human race. There is a contrast, too, between the gift and the
results of the one man's sin. The judgment, which followed on the one
man's sin, resulted in condemnation, but God's gracious gift, which
followed on many offences, resulted in a decree of righteousness. For
if, by reason of the offence of the one man, death reigned through that
one man, far more will those, on whom God's loving kindness and his gift
of righteousness are lavished, find life, and reign through the one man,
Jesus Christ. Briefly then, just as a single offence resulted for all
humanity in condemnation, so, too, a single decree of righteousness
resulted for all humanity in that declaration of righteousness which
brings life. For, as through the disobedience of the one man the whole
human race was rendered sinful, so, too, through the obedience of the
one, the whole human race will be rendered righteous. Law was introduced
in order that offences might be multiplied. But, where sins were
multiplied, the loving kindness of God was lavished the more, in order
that, just as sin had reigned in the realm of death, so, too, might
loving-kindness reign through righteousness, and result in eternal life,
through Jesus Christ, our Lord.

*Difficulties arising from this Teaching*

     What are we to say, then? Are we to continue to sin, in order that
God's loving kindness may be multiplied? Heaven forbid! We became dead
to sin, so how can we go on living in it? Or can it be that you do not
know that all of us, who were baptised into union with Christ Jesus, in
our baptism shared his death? Consequently, through sharing his death in
our baptism, we were buried with him; so that, just as Christ was raised
from the dead by a manifestation of the Father's power, so we also may
live a new life. If we have become united with him by the act symbolic
of his death, surely we will also become united with him by the act
symbolic of his resurrection. We recognise the truth that our old self
was crucified with Christ, in order that the body, the stronghold of
sin, might be rendered powerless, so that we should no longer be slaves
to sin. For the man who has so died has been pronounced righteous and
released from sin. And our belief is, that, as we have shared Christ's
death, we will also share his life. We know, indeed, that Christ, having
once risen from the dead, will not die again. Death has power over him
no longer. For the death that he died was a death to sin, once and for
all. But the life that he now lives, he lives for God. So let it be with
you -- regard yourselves as dead to sin, but as living for God, through
union with Christ Jesus. Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal
bodies and compel you to obey its cravings. Do not offer any part of
your bodies to sin, in the cause of unrighteousness, but once for all
offer yourselves to God (as those who, though once dead, now have life),
and devote every part of your bodies to the cause of righteousness. For
sin will not lord it over you. You are living under the reign, not of
Law, but of love.
     What follows, then? Are we to sin because we are living under the
reign of love and not of Law? Heaven forbid! Surely you know that when
you offer yourselves as servants, to obey anyone, you are the servants
of the person whom you obey, whether the service be a service to sin
which leads to death, or a service to duty which leads to righteousness.
God be thanked that, though you were once servants of sin, yet you
learned to give hearty obedience to that form of doctrine under which
you were placed. Set free from the control of sin, you became servants
to righteousness. I can but speak as people do because of the weakness
of your earthly nature. Once you offered every part of your bodies to
the service of impurity, and of wickedness, which leads to further
wickedness. Now, in the same way, offer them to the service of
righteousness, which leads to holiness. While you were still servants of
sin, you were free as regards righteousness. But what were the fruits
that you reaped from those things of which you are now ashamed? For the
end of such things is death. But now that you have been set free from
the control of sin, and have become servants to God, the fruit that you
reap is an ever increasing holiness, and the end eternal life. The wages
of sin are death, but the gift of God is eternal life, through union
with Christ Jesus, our Lord.
     Surely, friends, you know (for I am speaking to people who know
what Law means) that Law has power over a person only as long as they
lives. For example, by law a married woman is bound to her husband while
he is living; but, if her husband dies, she is set free from the law
that bound her to him. If, then, during her husband's lifetime, she
unites herself to another man, she will be called an adulteress; but, if
her husband dies, the law has no further hold on her, nor, if she unites
herself to another man, is she an adulteress. And so with you, my
friends; as far as the Law was concerned, you underwent death in the
crucified body of the Christ, so that you might be united to another, to
him who was raised from the dead, in order that our lives might bear
fruit for God. When we were living merely earthly lives, our sinful
passions, aroused by the Law, were active in every part of our bodies,
with the result that our lives bore fruit for death. But now we are set
free from the Law, because we are dead to that which once kept us under
restraint; and so we serve under new, spiritual conditions, and not
under old, written regulations.
     What are we to say, then? That Law and sin are the same thing?
Heaven forbid! On the contrary, I should not have learned what sin is,
had not it been for Law. If the Law did not say "You must not covet," I
should not know what it is to covet. But sin took advantage of the
commandment to arouse in me every form of covetousness, for where there
is no consciousness of Law sin shows no sign of life. There was a time
when I myself, unconscious of Law, was alive; but when the commandment
was brought home to me, sin sprang into life, while I died! The
commandment that should have meant life I found to result in death! Sin
took advantage of the commandment to deceive me, and used it to bring
about my death. And so the Law is holy, and each commandment is also
holy, and just, and good. Did, then, a thing, which in itself was good,
involve death in my case? Heaven forbid! It was sin that involved death;
so that, by its use of what I regarded as good to bring about my death,
its true nature might appear; and in this way the commandment showed how
intensely sinful sin is. We know that the Law is spiritual, but I am
earthly -- sold into slavery to sin. I do not understand my own actions.
For I am so far from habitually doing what I want to do, that I find
myself doing the thing that I hate. But when I do what I want not to do,
I am admitting that the Law is right. This being so, the action is no
longer my own, but is done by the sin which is within me. I know that
there is nothing good in me -- I mean in my earthly nature. For,
although it is easy for me to want to do right, to act rightly is not
easy. I fail to do the good thing that I want to do, but the bad thing
that I want not to do -- that I habitually do. But, when I do the thing
that I want not to do, the action is no longer my own, but is done by
the sin which is within me. This, then, is the law that I find -- when I
want to do right, wrong presents itself! At heart I delight in the Law
of God; but throughout my body I see a different law, one which is in
conflict with the law accepted by my reason, and which endeavours to
make me a prisoner to that law of sin which exists throughout my body.
Miserable man that I am! Who will deliver me from the body that is
bringing me to this death? Thank God, there is deliverance through Jesus
Christ, our Lord! Well then, for myself, with my reason I serve the Law
of God, but with my earthly nature the Law of sin.
     There is, therefore, now no condemnation for those who are in union
with Christ Jesus; for through your union with Christ Jesus, the Law of
the life-giving Spirit has set you free from the Law of sin and death.
What Law could not do, in so far as our earthly nature weakened its
action, God did, by sending his own Son, with a nature resembling our
sinful nature, to atone for sin. He condemned sin in that earthly
nature, so that the requirements of the Law might be satisfied in us who
live now in obedience, not to our earthly nature, but to the Spirit.
They who follow their earthly nature are earthly-minded, while they who
follow the Spirit are spiritually minded. To be earthly-minded means
death, to be spiritually minded means life and peace; because to be
earthly-minded is to be an enemy to God, for such a mind does not submit
to the Law of God, nor indeed can it do so. They who are earthly cannot
please God. You, however, are not earthly but spiritual, since the
Spirit of God lives within you. Unless a person has the Spirit of
Christ, they do not belong to Christ; but, if Christ is within you,
then, though the body is dead as a consequence of sin, the spirit is
life as a consequence of righteousness. And, if the Spirit of him who
raised Jesus from the dead lives within you, he who raised Christ Jesus
from the dead will give life even to your mortal bodies, through his
Spirit living within you.
     So then, friends, we owe nothing to our earthly nature, that we
should live in obedience to it. If you live in obedience to your earthly
nature, you will inevitably die; but if, by the power of the Spirit, you
put an end to the evil habits of the body, you will live. All who are
guided by the Spirit of God are children of God. For you did not receive
the spirit of a slave, to fill you once more with fear, but the spirit
of a child by adoption, which leads us to cry "Abba, our Father." The
Spirit himself unites with our spirits in bearing witness to our being
God's children, and if children, then heirs -- heirs of God, and joint
heirs with Christ, since we share Christ's sufferings in order that we
may also share his glory.
     I do not count the sufferings of our present life worthy of mention
when compared with the glory that is to be revealed and bestowed on us.
All nature awaits with eager expectation the appearing of the sons of
God. For nature was made subject to imperfection -- not by its own
choice, but owing to him who made it so -- yet not without the hope that
some day nature, also, will be set free from enslavement to decay, and
will attain to the freedom which will mark the glory of the children of
God. We know, indeed, that all nature alike has been groaning in the
pains of labour to this very hour. And not nature only; but we ourselves
also, though we have already a first gift of the Spirit -- we ourselves
are inwardly groaning, while we eagerly await our full adoption as sons
-- the redemption of our bodies. By our hope we were saved. But the
thing hoped for is no longer an object of hope when it is before our
eyes; for who hopes for what is before his eyes? But when we hope for
what is not before our eyes, then we wait for it with patience.
     So, also, the Spirit supports us in our weakness. We do not even
know how to pray as we should; but the Spirit himself pleads for us in
sighs that can find no utterance. Yet he who searches all our hearts
knows what the Spirit's meaning is, because the pleadings of the Spirit
for Christ's people are in accordance with his will. But we do know that
God causes all things to work together for the good of those who love
him -- those who have received the call in accordance with his purpose.
For those whom God chose from the first he also destined from the first
to be transformed into likeness to his Son, so that his Son might be the
eldest among many brothers and sisters. And those whom God destined for
this he also called; and those whom he called he also pronounced
righteous; and those whom he pronounced righteous he also brought to
glory.
     What are we to say, then, in the light of all this?

     If God is on our side, who can there be against us?
     God did not withhold his own Son, but gave him up on behalf of us
all; will he not, then, with him, freely give us all things?
     Who will bring a charge against any of God's people? He who
pronounces them righteous is God!
     Who is there to condemn them? He who died for us is Christ Jesus!
-- or, rather, it was he who was raised from the dead, and who is now at
God's right hand and is even pleading on our behalf!
     Who is there to separate us from the love of the Christ? Will
trouble, or difficulty, or persecution, or hunger, or nakedness, or
danger, or the sword?
     Scripture says -- "For your sake we are being killed all the day
long, We are regarded as sheep to be slaughtered." Yet amid all these
things we more than conquer through him who loved us! For I am persuaded
that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor archangels, nor the
present, nor the future, nor any powers, nor height, nor depth, nor any
other created thing, will be able to separate us from the love of God
revealed in Christ Jesus, our Lord!

*Gentiles and Jews*

     I am speaking the truth as one in union with Christ; it is no lie;
and my conscience, enlightened by the Holy Spirit, bears me out when I
say that there is a great weight of sorrow on me and that my heart is
never free from pain. I could wish that I were myself accursed and
severed from the Christ, for the sake of my people -- my own flesh and
blood. For they are Israelites, and theirs are the adoption as children,
the visible presence, the covenants, the revealed Law, the Temple
worship, and the promises. They are descended from the patriarchs, and,
as far as his human nature was concerned, from them came the Christ --
he who is supreme over all things, God for ever blessed. Amen.
     Not that God's Word has failed. For it is not all who are descended
from Israel who are true Israelites; nor, because they are Abraham's
descendants, are they all his children; but -- "It is Isaac's children
who will be called your descendants." This means that it is not the
children born in the course of nature who are God's children, but it is
the children born in fulfilment of the promise who are to be regarded as
Abraham's descendants. For these words are the words of a promise --
"About this time I will come, and Sarah will have a son." Nor is that
all. There is also the case of Rebecca, when she was about to bear
children to our ancestor Isaac. For in order that the purpose of God,
working through selection, might not fail -- a selection depending, not
on obedience, but on his call -- Rebecca was told, before her children
were born and before they had done anything either right or wrong, that
the elder would be a servant to the younger. The words of scripture are
-- "I loved Jacob, but I hated Esau."
     What are we to say, then? Is God guilty of injustice? Heaven
forbid! For his words to Moses are -- "I will take pity on whom I take
pity, and be merciful to whom I am merciful." So, then, all depends, not
on human wishes or human efforts, but on God's mercy. In scripture,
again, it is said to Pharaoh -- "It was for this purpose that I raised
you to the throne, to show my power by my dealings with you, and to make
my name known throughout the world." So, then, where God wills, he takes
pity, and where he wills, he hardens the heart. Perhaps you will say to
me -- "How can anyone still be blamed? For who withstands his purpose?"
I might rather ask "Who are you who are arguing with God?" Does a thing
which a person has moulded say to the person who has moulded it "Why did
you make me like this?" Has not the potter absolute power over their
clay, so that out of the same lump they make one thing for better, and
another for common, use? And what if God, intending to reveal his
displeasure and make his power known, bore most patiently with the
objects of his displeasure, though they were fit only to be destroyed,
so as to make known his surpassing glory in dealing with the objects of
his mercy, whom he prepared beforehand for glory, and whom he called --
even us -- not only from among the Jews but from among the Gentiles
also! This, indeed, is what he says in the book of Hosea -- "Those who
were not my people, I will call my people, and those who were unloved I
will love. And in the place where it was said to them -- 'You are not my
people', they will be called sons of the living God." And Isaiah cries
aloud over Israel -- "Though the sons of Israel are like the sand of the
sea in number, only a remnant of them will escape! For the Lord will
execute his sentence on the world, fully and without delay." It is as
Isaiah foretold -- "Had not the Lord of Hosts spared some few of our
people to us, we should have become like Sodom and been made to resemble
Gomorrah."
     What are we to say, then? Why, that Gentiles, who were not in
search of righteousness, secured it -- a righteousness which was the
result of faith; while Israel, which was in search of a Law which would
ensure righteousness, failed to discover one. And why? Because they
looked to obedience, and not to faith, to secure it. They stumbled over
the stumbling-block. As scripture says -- "See, I place a stumbling-
block in Zion -- a rock which will prove a hindrance; and he who
believes in him will have no cause for shame."
     My friends, my heart's desire and prayer to God for my people is
for their salvation. I can testify that they are zealous for the honour
of God; but they are not guided by true insight, for, in their ignorance
of the divine righteousness, and in their eagerness to set up a
righteousness of their own, they refused to accept with submission the
divine righteousness. For Christ has brought Law to an end, so that
righteousness may be obtained by everyone who believes in him. For Moses
writes that, as for the righteousness which results from Law, those who
practice it will find life through it. But the righteousness which
results from faith finds expression in these words: "Do not say to
yourself 'Who will go up into heaven?'" (which means to bring Christ
down) "or 'Who will go down into the depths below?'" (which means to
bring Christ up from the dead). No, but what does it say? "The message
is near you, on your lips and in your heart" (which means "The message
of faith" which we proclaim). For, if with your lips you acknowledge the
truth of the message that JESUS IS LORD, and believe in your heart that
God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For with their hearts
people believe and so attain to righteousness, while with their lips
they make their profession of faith and so find salvation. As the
passage of scripture says -- "No one who believes in him will have any
cause for shame." For no distinction is made between the Jew and the
Greek, for all have the same Lord, and he is bountiful to all who invoke
him. For everyone who invokes the name of the Lord will be saved. But
how, it may be asked, are they to invoke one in whom they have not
learned to believe? And how are they to believe in one whose words they
have not heard? And how are they to hear his words unless someone
proclaims him? And how is anyone to proclaim him unless they are sent as
his messengers? As scripture says -- "How beautiful are the feet of
those who bring good news!"
     Still, it may be said, everyone did not give heed to the good news.
No, for Isaiah asks -- "Lord, who has believed our teaching?" And so we
gather, faith is a result of teaching, and the teaching comes in the
message of Christ. But I ask "Is it possible that people have never
heard?" No, indeed, for -- "Their voices spread through all the earth,
and their message to the ends of the world." But again I ask "Did not
the people of Israel understand?" First there is Moses, who says -- "I,
the Lord, will stir you to rivalry with a nation which is no nation;
against an undiscerning nation I will arouse your anger." And Isaiah
says boldly -- "I was found by those who were not seeking me; I made
myself known to those who were not inquiring of me." But of the people
of Israel he says -- "All day long I have stretched out my hands to a
people who disobey and contradict."
     I ask, then, "Has God rejected his people?" Heaven forbid! For I
myself am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham, of the tribe of
Benjamin. God has not rejected his people, whom he chose from the first.
Have you forgotten the words of scripture in the story of Elijah -- how
he appeals to God against Israel? "Lord, they have killed your prophets,
they have pulled down your altars, and I only am left; and now they are
eager to take my life." But what was the divine response? "I have kept
for myself seven thousand who have never bowed the knee to Baal." And so
in our own time, too, there is to be found a remnant of our nation
selected by God in love. But if in love, then it is not as a result of
obedience. Otherwise love would cease to be love. What follows from
this? Why, that Israel as a nation failed to secure what it was seeking,
while those whom God selected did secure it. The rest grew callous; as
scripture says -- "God has given them a deadness of mind -- eyes that
are not to see and ears that are not to hear -- and it is so to this
very day." David, too, says -- "May their feasts prove a snare and a
trap to them -- a hindrance and a retribution; may their eyes be
darkened, so that they cannot see; and do you always make their backs to
bend." I ask then -- "Was their stumbling to result in their fall?"
Heaven forbid! On the contrary, through their falling away salvation has
reached the Gentiles, to stir the rivalry of Israel. And, if their
falling away has enriched the world, and their failure has enriched the
Gentiles, how much more will result from their full restoration!
     But I am speaking to you who were Gentiles. Being myself an apostle
to the Gentiles, I exalt my office, in the hope that I may stir my
countrymen to rivalry, and so save some of them. For, if their being
cast aside has meant the reconciliation of the world, what will their
reception mean, but life from the dead? If the first handful of dough is
holy, so is the whole mass, and if the root is holy, so are the
branches. Some, however, of the branches were broken off, and you, who
were only a wild olive, were grafted in among them, and came to share
with them the root which is the source of the richness of the cultivated
olive. Yet do not exult over the other branches. But, if you do exult
over them, remember that you do not support the root, but that the root
supports you. But branches, you will say, were broken off, so that I
might be grafted in. True, it was because of their want of faith that
they were broken off, and it is because of your faith that you are
standing. Do not think too highly of yourself, but beware. For, if God
did not spare the natural branches, neither will he spare you. See,
then, both the goodness and the severity of God -- his severity towards
those who fell, and his goodness towards you, provided that you continue
to confide in that goodness; otherwise you, also, will be cut off. And
they, too, if they do not continue in their unbelief, will be grafted
in; for God has it in his power to graft them in again. If you were cut
off from your natural stock -- a wild olive -- and were grafted,
contrary to the course of nature, on a good olive, much more will they
-- the natural branches -- be grafted back into their parent tree.
     My friends, so that you don't think too highly of yourselves, I
want you to recognise the truth, hitherto hidden, that the callousness
which has come over Israel is only partial, and will continue only until
the whole Gentile world has been gathered in. And then all Israel will
be saved. As scripture says -- "From Zion will come the Deliverer; he
will banish ungodliness from Jacob. And they will see the fulfilment of
my covenant, when I have taken away their sins." From the standpoint of
the good news, the Jews are God's enemies for your sake; but from the
standpoint of God's selection, they are dear to him for the sake of the
patriarchs. For God never regrets his gifts or his call. Just as you at
one time were disobedient to him, but have now found mercy in the day of
their disobedience; so, too, they have now become disobedient in your
day of mercy, in order that they also in their turn may now find mercy.
For God has given all alike over to disobedience, that to all alike he
may show mercy. Oh! The unfathomable wisdom and knowledge of God! How
inscrutable are his judgments, how untraceable his ways! Yes -- ho has
ever comprehended the mind of the Lord? Who has ever become his
counsellor? Or who has first given to him, so that he may claim a
reward? For all things are from him, through him, and for him. And to
him be all glory for ever and ever! Amen.

*Advice on Daily Life*

     I entreat you, then, friends, by the mercies of God, to offer your
bodies as a living and holy sacrifice, acceptable to God, for this is
your rational worship. Do not conform to the fashion of this world; but
be transformed by the complete change that has come over your minds, so
that you may discern what God's will is -- all that is good, acceptable,
and perfect.
     In fulfilment of the charge with which I have been entrusted, I
tell every one of you not to think more highly of themselves than they
ought to think, but to think until they learn to think soberly -- in
accordance with the measure of faith that God has allotted to each. For,
just as in the human body there is a union of many parts, and each part
has its own function, so we, by our union in Christ, many though we are,
form but one body, and individually we are related one to another as its
parts. Since our gifts differ in accordance with the particular charge
entrusted to us, if our gift is to preach, let our preaching correspond
to our faith; if it is to minister to others, let us devote ourselves to
our ministry; the teacher to their teaching, the counselor to their
counsel. Let the person who gives in charity do so with a generous
heart; let the person who is in authority exercise due diligence; let
the person who shows kindness do so in a cheerful spirit. Let your love
be sincere. Hate the wrong; cling to the right. In the love of the
community of the Lord's followers, be affectionate to one another; in
showing respect, set an example of deference to one another; never
flagging in zeal; fervent in spirit; serving the Master; rejoicing in
your hope; steadfast under persecution; persevering in prayer; relieving
the wants of Christ's people; devoted to hospitality. Bless your
persecutors -- bless and never curse. Rejoice with those who are
rejoicing, and weep with those who are weeping. Let the same spirit of
sympathy animate you all, not a spirit of pride; enjoy the company of
ordinary people. Do not think too highly of yourselves. Never return
injury for injury. Aim at doing what everyone will recognise as
honourable. If it is possible, as far as rests with you, live peaceably
with everyone. Never avenge yourselves, dear friends, but make way for
the wrath of God; for scripture declares -- "'It is for me to avenge, I
will requite,' says the Lord." Rather -- "If your enemy is hungry, feed
him; if he is thirsty, give him to drink. By doing this you will heap
coals of fire on his head." Never be conquered by evil, but conquer evil
with good.
     Let everyone obey the supreme authorities. For no authority exists
except by the will of God, and the existing authorities have been
appointed by God. Therefore the one who sets themself against the
authorities is resisting God's appointment, and those who resist will
bring a judgment on themselves. A good action has nothing to fear from
rulers; a bad action has. Do you want to have no reason to fear the
authorities? Then do what is good, and you will win their praise. For
they are God's servants appointed for your good. But, if you do what is
wrong, you may well be afraid; for the sword they carry is not without
meaning! They are God's servants to inflict his punishments on those who
do wrong. You are bound, therefore, to obey, not only through fear of
God's punishments, but also as a matter of conscience. This, too, is the
reason for your paying taxes; for the officials are God's officers,
devoting themselves to this special work. In all cases pay what is due
from you -- tribute where tribute is due, taxes where taxes are due,
respect where respect is due, and honour where honour is due.
     Owe nothing to anyone except love; for they who love their
neighbour have satisfied the Law. The commandments, "You must not commit
adultery, you must not kill, you must not steal, you must not covet,"
and whatever other commandment there is, are all summed up in the words
-- "You must love your neighbour as you love yourself." Love never
wrongs a neighbour. Therefore love fully satisfies the Law. This I say,
because you know the crisis that we have reached, for the time has
already come for you to rouse yourselves from sleep; our salvation is
nearer now than when we accepted the faith.
     The night is almost gone; the day is near. Therefore let us be done
with the deeds of darkness, and arm ourselves with the weapons of light.
Being in the light of day, let us live becomingly, not in revelry and
drunkenness, not in lust and licentiousness, not in quarrelling and
jealousy. No! Arm yourselves with the spirit of the Lord Jesus Christ,
and spend no thought on your earthly nature, to satisfy its cravings.
     As for those whose faith is weak, always receive them as friends,
but not for the purpose of passing judgment on their scruples. One
person's faith permits them to eat food of all kinds, while another
whose faith is weak eats only vegetable food. The person who eats meat
must not despise the person who abstains from it; nor must the person
who abstains from eating meat pass judgment on the one who eats it, for
God himself has received them. Who are you, that you should pass
judgment on the servant of another? Their standing or falling concerns
their own master. And stand they will, for their Master can enable them
to stand. Again, one person considers some days to be more sacred than
others, while another considers all days to be alike. Everyone ought to
be fully convinced in their own mind. The person who observes a day,
observes it to the Master's honour. They, again, who eat meat eat it to
the Master's honour, for they give thanks to God; while the person who
abstains from it abstains from it to the Master's honour, and also gives
thanks to God. There is not one of us whose life concerns ourselves
alone, and not one of us whose death concerns ourself alone; for, if we
live, our life is for the Master, and, if we die, our death is for the
Master. Whether, then, we live or die we belong to the Master. The
purpose for which Christ died and came back to life was this -- that he
might be Lord over both the dead and the living. I would ask the one
"Why do you judge other followers of the Lord?" And I would ask the
other "Why do you despise them?" For we will all stand before the court
of God. For scripture says -- "'As surely as I live,' says the Lord,
'every knee will bend before me and every tongue will praise God.'" So,
then, each one of us will have to render account of himself to God.
     Let us, then, cease to judge one another. Rather let this be your
resolve -- never to place a stumbling-block or an obstacle in the way of
a fellow follower of the Lord. Through my union with the Lord Jesus, I
know and am persuaded that nothing is defiling in itself. A thing is
"defiling" only to the person who holds it to be so. If, for the sake of
what you eat, you wound your fellow follower's feelings, your life has
ceased to be ruled by love. Do not, by what you eat, ruin someone for
whom Christ died! Do not let what is right for you become a matter of
reproach. For the kingdom of God does not consist of eating and
drinking, but of righteousness and peace and gladness through the
presence of the Holy Spirit. The person who serves the Christ in this
way pleases God, and wins the approval of their fellows. Therefore our
efforts should be directed towards all that makes for peace and the
mutual building up of character. Do not undo God's work for the sake of
what you eat. Though everything is "clean," yet, if a person eats so as
to put a stumbling-block in the way of others, they do wrong. The right
course is to abstain from meat or wine or, indeed, anything that is a
stumbling-block to your fellow follower of the Lord. As for yourself --
keep this conviction of yours to yourself, as in the presence of God.
Happy the person who never has to condemn themselves in regard to
something they think right! The person, however, who has misgivings
stands condemned if they still eat, because their doing so is not the
result of faith. And anything not done as the result of faith is a sin.
     We, the strong, ought to take on our own shoulders the weaknesses
of those who are not strong, and not merely to please ourselves. Let
each of us please our neighbour for our neighbour's good, to help in the
building up of their character. Even the Christ did not please himself!
On the contrary, as scripture says of him -- "The reproaches of those
who were reproaching you fell upon me." Whatever was written in the
scriptures in days gone by was written for our instruction, so that,
through patient endurance, and through the encouragement drawn from the
scriptures, we might hold fast to our hope. And may God, the giver of
this patience and this encouragement, grant you to be united in sympathy
in Christ, so that with one heart and one voice you may praise the God
and Father of Jesus Christ, our Lord. Therefore always receive one
another as friends, just as the Christ himself received us, to the glory
of God. For I tell you that Christ, in vindication of God's
truthfulness, has become a minister of the covenant of circumcision, so
that he may fulfil the promises made to our ancestors, and that the
Gentiles also may praise God for his mercy. As scripture says --
"Therefore will I make acknowledgment to you among the Gentiles and sing
in honour of your name." And again it says -- "Rejoice, you Gentiles,
with God's people." And yet again -- "Praise the Lord, all you Gentiles,
and let all Peoples sing his praises." Again, Isaiah says -- "There will
be a Scion of the house of Jesse, One who is to arise to rule the
Gentiles; on him will the Gentiles rest their hopes." May God, who
inspires our hope, grant you perfect happiness and peace in your faith,
until you are filled with this hope by the power of the Holy Spirit.
     I am persuaded, my friends -- yes, I Paul, with regard to you --
that you are yourselves full of kindness, furnished with all Christian
learning, and well able to give advice to one another. But in parts of
this letter I have expressed myself somewhat boldly -- by way of
refreshing your memories -- because of the charge with which God has
entrusted me, that I should be an assistant of Christ Jesus to go to the
Gentiles -- that I should act as a priest of God's good news, so that
the offering up of the Gentiles may be an acceptable sacrifice,
consecrated by the Holy Spirit. It is, then, through my union with
Christ Jesus that I have a proud confidence in my work for God. For I
will not dare to speak of anything but what Christ has done through me
to win the obedience of the Gentiles -- by my words and actions, through
the power displayed in signs and marvels, and through the power of the
Holy Spirit. And so, starting from Jerusalem and going as far as
Illyria, I have told in full the good news of the Christ; yet always
with the ambition to tell the good news where Christ's name had not
previously been heard, so as to avoid building on another's foundations.
But as scripture says -- "They to whom he had never been proclaimed will
see; and they who have never heard will understand!"

*Conclusion*

     That is why I have so often been prevented from coming to you. But
now there are no further openings for me in these parts, and I have for
several years been longing to come to you whenever I may be going to
Spain. For my hope is to visit you on my journey, and then to be sent on
my way by you, after I have first partly satisfied myself by seeing
something of you. Just now, however, I am on my way to Jerusalem, to
take help to Christ's people there. For Macedonia and Greece have been
glad to make a collection for the poor among Christ's people at
Jerusalem. Yes, they were glad to do so; and indeed it is a duty which
they owe to them. For the Gentile converts who have shared their
spiritual blessings are in duty bound to minister to them in the things
of this world. When I have settled this matter, and have secured for the
poor at Jerusalem the enjoyment of these benefits, I will go, by way of
you, to Spain. And I know that, when I come to you, it will be with a
full measure of blessing from Christ.
     I beg you, then, friends, by Jesus Christ, our Lord, and by the
love inspired by the Spirit, to join me in earnest prayer to God on my
behalf. Pray that I may be rescued from those in Judea who reject the
faith, and that the help which I am taking to Jerusalem may prove
acceptable to Christ's people; so that, God willing, I may be able to
come to you with a joyful heart, and enjoy some rest among you. May God,
the giver of peace, be with you all. Amen.
     I commend to your care our sister, Phoebe, who is a minister of the
church at Cenchreae; and I ask you to give her a Christian welcome --
one worthy of Christ's people -- and to aid her in any matter in which
she may need your assistance. She has proved herself a staunch friend
and protector and to many others.
     Give my greeting to Prisca and Aquila, my fellow workers in the
cause of Christ Jesus, who risked their own lives to save mine. It is
not I alone who thank them, but all the churches among the Gentiles
thank them also. Give my greeting, also, to the church that meets at
their house, as well as to my dear friend Epaenetus, one of the first in
Roman Asia to believe in Christ; to Mary, who worked hard for you; to
Andronicus and Junia, fellow Jews and once my fellow prisoners, who are
people of note among the apostles, and who became Christians before I
did; to my dear Christian friend Ampliatus; to Urban, our fellow worker
in the cause of Christ, and to my dear friend Stachys; to that tried and
true Christian Apelles; to the household of Aristobulus; to my
countryman Herodion; to the Christians in the household of Narcissus; to
Tryphaena and Tryphosa, who have worked hard for the Master; to my dear
friend Persis, for she has done much hard work for the Master; to that
eminent Christian, Rufus, and to his mother, who has been a mother to me
also; to Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermes, Patrobas, Hermas, and our friends
with them; also to Philologus and Julia, Nereus and his sister, and
Olympas, and to all Christ's people who are with them. Greet one another
with a sacred kiss. All the churches of the Christ send you greetings.
     I beg you, friends, to be on your guard against people who, by
disregarding the teaching which you received, cause divisions and create
difficulties; dissociate yourselves from them. For such persons are not
serving Christ, our Master, but are slaves to their own appetites; and,
by their smooth words and flattery, they deceive simple-minded people.
Everyone has heard of your ready obedience. It is true that I am very
happy about you, but I want you to be well versed in all that is good,
and innocent of all that is bad. And God, the giver of peace, will
before long crush Satan under your feet.
     May the blessing of Jesus, our Lord, be with you.
     Timothy, my fellow worker, sends you his greetings, and Lucius,
Jason, and Sosipater, my countrymen, send theirs.
     I Tertius, who am writing this letter, send you my Christian
greeting.
     My host Gaius, who extends his hospitality to the whole church,
sends you his greeting; and Erastus, the city treasurer, and Quartus,
our dear friend, add theirs. {  (16:24)  Some later manuscripts add: The
grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen. }
     Now to him who is able to strengthen you, as promised in the good
news entrusted to me and in the proclamation of Jesus Christ, in
accordance with the revelation of that hidden purpose, which in past
ages was kept secret but now has been revealed and, in obedience to the
command of the immortal God, made known through the writings of the
prophets to all nations, to secure submission to the faith -- to him, I
say, the wise and only God, be ascribed, through Jesus Christ, all glory
for ever and ever. Amen.

                       PAUL'S FIRST LETTER TO THE
                              CORINTHIANS


*Introduction*

     To the church of God in Corinth, to those who have been consecrated
by union with Christ Jesus and called to become his people, and also to
all, wherever they may be, who invoke the name of our Lord Jesus Christ
-- their Master and ours, from Paul, who has been called to be an
apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and from Sosthenes, our
fellow follower of the Lord.
     May God, our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ bless you and give
you peace.

     I always thank God for you. I thank him for the blessing bestowed
on you in Christ Jesus. For through union with him you were enriched in
every way -- in your power to preach, and in your knowledge of the
truth; and so became yourselves a confirmation of my testimony to the
Christ. There is no gift in which you are deficient, while waiting for
our Lord Jesus Christ to be revealed. And God himself will strengthen
you to the end, so that at the day of our Lord Jesus Christ you may be
found blameless. God will not fail you, and it is he who called you into
communion with his Son, Jesus Christ, our Lord.

*The State of the Church at Corinth*

     But I appeal to you, my friends, by the name of our Lord Jesus
Christ, to agree in what you profess, and not to allow divisions to
exist among you, but to be united -- of one mind and of one opinion. For
I have been informed, my friends, by the members of Chloe's household,
that party feeling exists among you. I mean this: that every one of you
says either "I follow Paul," or "I Apollos," or "I Cephas," or "I
Christ." You have torn the Christ in pieces! Was it Paul who was
crucified for you? Or were you baptised in the name of Paul? I am
thankful that I did not baptise any of you except Crispus and Gaius, so
that no one can say that you were baptised in my name. I baptised also
the household of Stephanas. I do not know that I baptised anyone else.
My mission from Christ was not to baptise, but to tell the good news;
not, however, in the language of philosophy, in case the cross of the
Christ should be robbed of its meaning.

     The message of the cross is indeed mere folly to those who are on
the path to ruin, but to us who are on the path of salvation it is the
power of God. For scripture says --

     "I will bring the philosophy of the philosophers to naught, and the
shrewdness of the shrewd I will bring to nothing."
 Where is the philosopher? Where the teacher of the Law? Where the
disputant of today? Has not God shown the world's philosophy to be
folly? For since the world, in God's wisdom, did not by its philosophy
learn to know God, God saw fit, by the "folly" of our proclamation, to
save those who believe in Christ! While Jews ask for miraculous signs,
and Greeks study philosophy, we are proclaiming Christ crucified! -- to
the Jews an obstacle, to the Gentiles mere folly, but to those who have
received the call, whether Jews or Greeks, Christ, the power of God and
the wisdom of God! For God's "folly" is wiser than people, and God's
"weakness" is stronger than people.
     Look at the facts of your call, friends. There are not many among
you who are wise, as people reckon wisdom, not many who are influential,
not many who are high-born; but God chose what the world counts foolish
to put its wise to shame, and God chose what the world counts weak to
put its strong to shame, and God chose what the world counts poor and
insignificant -- things that to it are unreal -- to bring its
"realities" to nothing, so that in his presence no one should boast. But
you, by your union with Christ Jesus, belong to God; and Christ, by
God's will, became not only our wisdom, but also our righteousness,
holiness, and deliverance, so that -- in the words of scripture --

     "Whoever boasts should boast of the Lord!"
     For my own part, friends, when I came to you, it was with no
display of eloquence or philosophy that I came to tell the hidden
purpose of God; for I had determined that, while with you, I would
forget everything except Jesus Christ -- and him crucified! Indeed, when
I came among you, I was weak, and full of fears, and in great anxiety.
My message and my proclamation were not delivered in the persuasive
language of philosophy, but were accompanied by the manifestation of
spiritual power, so that your faith should be based, not on the human
wisdom, but on the power of God.
     Yet there is a philosophy that we teach to those whose faith is
matured, but it is not the philosophy of today, or of the leaders of
today -- whose downfall is at hand. No, it is a divine philosophy that
we teach, one concerned with the hidden purpose of God -- that long
hidden philosophy which God, before time began, destined for our glory.
This philosophy is clearly not known to any of the leaders of today,
since, had they known it, they would never have crucified our glorious
Lord! It is what scripture speaks of as --

     "What eye never saw, nor ear ever heard,
     what never entered people's minds --
         all these things God has prepared for those who love him."
 Yet to us God revealed it through his Spirit; for the Spirit fathoms
all things, even the inmost depths of God's being. For what person is
there who knows what a person is, except the person's own spirit within
them? So, also, no one comprehends what God is, except the Spirit of
God. And as for us, it is not the spirit of the world that we have
received, but the Spirit that comes from God, so that we may realize the
blessings given to us by him. And we speak of these gifts, not in
language taught by human philosophy, but in language taught by the
Spirit, explaining spiritual things in spiritual words. The merely
intellectual person rejects the teaching of the Spirit of God; for to
them it is mere folly; they cannot grasp it, because it is to be
understood only by spiritual insight. But the person with spiritual
insight is able to understand everything, although they themselves are
understood by no one. For who has so comprehended the mind of the Lord
as to be able to instruct him? We, however, have the mind of Christ.
     But I, my friends, could not speak to you as people with spiritual
insight, but only as worldly-minded -- mere infants in the faith of
Christ. I fed you with milk, not with solid food, for you were not then
able to take it.
     No, and even now you are not able; you are still worldly. While
there exist among you jealousy and party feeling, is it not true that
you are worldly, and are acting merely as other people do? When one says
"I follow Paul," and another "I follow Apollos," aren't you like other
people? What, I ask, is Apollos? Or what is Paul? Servants through whom
you were led to accept the faith; and that only as the Lord helped each
of you. I planted, and Apollos watered, but it was God who caused the
growth. Therefore neither the one who plants, nor the one who waters,
counts for anything, but only God who causes the growth. In this the
person who plants and the person who waters are one; yet each will
receive their own reward in proportion to their own labour. For we are
God's fellow workers; you are God's harvest field, God's building.
     In fulfilment of the charge which God had entrusted to me, I laid
the foundation like a skilful master; but someone else is now building
on it. Let everyone take care how they build; for no one can lay any
other foundation than the one already laid -- Jesus Christ. Whatever is
used by those who build on this foundation, whether gold, silver, costly
stones, wood, hay, or straw, the quality of each man's work will become
known, for the day will make it plain; because that day is to be ushered
in with fire, and the fire itself will test the quality of every man's
work. If anyone's work, which they have built on that foundation, still
remains, they will gain a reward. If anyone's work is burnt up, they
will suffer loss; though they themselves will escape, but only as one
who has passed through fire.
     Don't you know that you are God's Temple, and that God's Spirit has
his home in you? If any one destroys the Temple of God, God will destroy
them; for the Temple of God is sacred, and so also are you.

     Let no one deceive himself. If any one among you imagines that, as
regards this world, they are wise, they should become a "fool," that
they may become wise. For in God's sight this world's wisdom is folly.
Scripture tells of --

     "One who catches the wise in their own craftiness,"
 And it says again --

     "The Lord sees how fruitless are the deliberations of the wise."
 Therefore let no one boast about people; for all things are yours --
whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or
the present, or the future -- all things are yours! But you are Christ's
and Christ is God's.
     Let people look on us as Christ's servants, and as stewards of the
hidden truths of God. Now what we look for in stewards is that they
should be trustworthy. But it weighs very little with me that I am
judged by you or by any human tribunal. No, I do not even judge myself;
for, though I am conscious of nothing against myself, that does not
prove me innocent. It is the Lord who is my judge. Therefore do not pass
judgment before the time, but wait until the Lord comes. He will throw
light on what is now dark and obscure, and will reveal the motives in
people's minds; and then everyone will receive due praise from God.
     All this, friends, I have, for your sakes, applied to Apollos and
myself, so that, from our example, you may learn to observe the precept
-- "Keep to what is written," that none of you may speak boastfully of
one teacher to the disparagement of another. For who makes any one of
you superior to others? And what have you that was not given you? But if
you received it as a gift, why do you boast as if you had not? Are you
all so soon satisfied? Are you so soon rich? Have you begun to reign
without us? Would indeed that you had, so that we also might reign with
you! For, as it seems to me, God has exhibited us, the apostles, last of
all, as people doomed to death. We are made a spectacle to the universe,
both to angels and to people! We, for Christ's sake, are fools, but you,
by your union with Christ, are people of discernment. We are weak, but
you are strong. You are honoured, but we are despised. To this very hour
we go hungry, thirsty, and naked; we are beaten; we are homeless; we
work hard, toiling with our own hands. We meet abuse with blessings, we
meet persecution with endurance, we meet slander with gentle appeals. We
have been treated as the scum of the earth, the vilest of the vile, to
this very hour.
     It is with no wish to shame you that I am writing like this; but to
warn you as my own dear children. Though you may have thousands of
instructors in the faith of Christ, yet you have not many fathers. It
was I who, through union with Christ Jesus, became your father by means
of the good news. Therefore I entreat you -- Follow my example. This is
my reason for sending Timothy to you. He is my own dear faithful child
in the Master's service, and he will remind you of my methods of
teaching the faith of Christ Jesus -- methods which I follow everywhere
in every church.
     Some, I hear, are puffed up with pride, thinking that I am not
coming to you. But come to you I will, and that soon, if it please the
Lord; and then I will find out, not what words these people use who are
so puffed up, but what power they possess; for the kingdom of God is
based, not on words, but on power. What do you wish? Am I to come to you
with a rod, or in a loving and gentle spirit?
     There is a wide-spread report respecting a case of immorality among
you, and that, too, of a kind that does not occur even among the
Gentiles -- a man, I hear, is living with his father's wife! Instead of
grieving over it and taking steps for the expulsion of the man who has
done this thing, is it possible that you are still puffed up? For I
myself, though absent in body, have been present with you in spirit, and
in the name of our Lord Jesus I have already passed judgment, just as if
I had been present, on the man who has acted in this way. I have decided
-- having been present in spirit at your meetings, when the power of the
Lord Jesus was with us -- to deliver such a man as this over to Satan,
that what is sensual in him may be destroyed, so that his spirit may be
saved at the day of the Lord. Your boasting is unseemly. Don't you know
that even a little yeast leavens all the dough? Get rid entirely of the
old leaven, so that you may be like new dough -- free from leaven, as in
truth you are. For our passover lamb is already sacrificed -- Christ
himself; therefore let us keep our festival, not with the leaven of
former days, nor with the leaven of vice and wickedness, but with the
unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.
     I told you, in my letter, not to associate with immoral people --
not, of course, meaning people of the world who are in immoral, or who
are covetous and grasping, or who worship idols; for then you would have
to leave the world altogether. But, as things are, I say that you are
not to associate with anyone who, although a follower of Christ in name,
is immoral, or covetous, or an idolater, or abusive, or a drunkard, or
grasping -- no, not even to sit down to eat with such people. What have
I to do with judging those outside the church? Is it not for you to
judge those who are within the church, while God judges those who are
outside? Put away the wicked from among you.

     Can it be that, when one of you has a dispute with another, they
dare to have their case tried before the heathen, instead of before
Christ's people? Don't you know that Christ's people will try the world?
And if the world is to be tried by you, are you unfit to try the most
trivial cases? Don't you know that we are to try angels -- to say
nothing of the affairs of this life? Why, then, if you have cases
relating to the affairs of this life, do you set to try them those who
carry no weight with the church? To your shame I ask it. Can it be that
there is not one among you wise enough to decide between two of their
fellow followers? Must a follower sue a fellow follower? In front of
unbelievers? To begin with, it is undoubtedly a loss to you to have
lawsuits with one another. Why not rather let yourselves be wronged? Why
not rather let yourselves be cheated? Instead of this, you wrong and
cheat others yourselves -- yes, even other followers! Don't you know
that wrongdoers will have no share in God's kingdom? Do not be deceived.
No one who is immoral, or an idolater, or an adulterer, or licentious,
or a sexual pervert, or a thief, or covetous, or a drunkard, or abusive,
or grasping, will have any share in God's kingdom. Such some of you used
to be; but you washed yourselves clean. You became Christ's people! You
were pronounced righteous through the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, and
through the Spirit of our God!

     Everything is allowable for me! Yes, but everything is not
profitable. Everything is allowable for me! Yes, but for my part, I will
not let myself be enslaved by anything. Food exists for the stomach, and
the stomach for food; but God will put an end to both the one and the
other. The body, however, exists, not for immorality, but for the Lord,
and the Lord for the body; and, as God has raised the Lord, so he will
raise us up also by the exercise of his power. Don't you know that your
bodies are Christ's members? Am I, then, to take the members that belong
to the Christ and make them the members of a prostitute? Heaven forbid!
Or don't you know that a man who unites himself with a prostitute is one
with her in body (for "the two," it is said, "will become one"); while a
man who is united with the Lord is one with him in spirit? Shun all
immorality. Every other sin that people commit is something outside the
body; but an immoral person sins against their own body. Again, don't
you know that your body is a shrine of the Holy Spirit that is within
you -- the Spirit which you have from God? Moreover, you are not your
own masters; you were bought, and the price was paid. Therefore, honour
God in your bodies.

*Answers to Questions Asked by the Church at Corinth*

     With reference to the subjects about which you wrote to me: It is
good for a man to remain single. But, owing to the prevalence of
immorality, I advise every man to have his own wife, and every woman her
husband. A husband should give his wife her due, and a wife her husband.
It is not the wife, but the husband, who exercises power over her body;
and so, too, it is not the husband, but the wife, who exercises power
over his body. Do not deprive each other of what is due -- unless it is
only for a time and by mutual consent, so that your minds may be free
for prayer until you again live as man and wife -- otherwise Satan might
take advantage of your want of self-control and tempt you. I say this,
however, as a concession, not as a command. I should wish everyone to be
just what I am myself. But everyone has his own gift from God -- one in
one way, and one in another.

     My advice, then, to those who are not married, and to widows, is
this: It would be good for them to remain as I am myself. But, if they
cannot control themselves, they should marry, for it is better to marry
than to be consumed with passion. To those who are married my direction
is -- yet it is not mine, but the Master's -- that a woman is not to
leave her husband (If she has done so, she should remain as she is, or
else be reconciled to her husband) and also that a man is not to divorce
his wife. To all others I say -- I, not the Master -- If a follower of
the Lord is married to a woman, who is an unbeliever but willing to live
with him, he should not divorce her; and a woman who is married to a
man, who is an unbeliever but willing to live with her, should not
divorce her husband. For, through his wife, the husband who is an
unbeliever has become associated with Christ's people; and the wife who
is an unbeliever has become associated with Christ's people through the
Lord's follower whom she has married. Otherwise your children would be
"defiled," but, as it is, they belong to Christ's people. However, if
the unbeliever wishes to be separated, let them be so. Under such
circumstances neither is bound; God has called you to live in peace. How
can you tell, wife, whether you may not save your husband? And how can
you tell, husband, whether you may not save your wife?
     In any case, a person should continue to live in the condition
which the Lord has allotted to them, and in which they were when God
called them. This is the rule that I lay down in every church. Was a man
already circumcised when he was called? Then he should not efface his
circumcision. Has a man been called when uncircumcised? Then he should
not be circumcised. Circumcision is nothing; the want of it is nothing;
but to keep the commands of God is everything. Let everyone remain in
that condition of life in which they were when the call came to them.
Were you a slave when you were called? Do not let that trouble you. No,
even if you are able to gain your freedom, still do your best. For the
person who was a slave when they were called to the master's service is
the Master's freedman; so, too, the person who was free when called is
Christ's slave. You were bought, and the price was paid. Do not let
yourselves become slaves to people. Friends, let everyone remain in the
condition in which they were when they were called, in close communion
with God.

     With regard to unmarried women, I have no command from the Master
to give you, but I tell you my opinion, and the Master in his mercy has
made me worthy to be trusted. I think, then, that, in view of the time
of suffering that has now come upon us, what I have already said is best
-- that a man should remain as he is. Are you married to a wife? Then do
not seek to be separated. Are you separated from a wife? Then do not
seek for a wife. Still, if you should marry, that is not wrong; nor, if
a young woman marries, is that wrong. But those who marry will have much
trouble to bear, and my wish is to spare you. What I mean, friends, is
this -- the time is short. Meanwhile, let those who have wives live as
if they had none, those who are weeping as if not weeping, those who are
rejoicing as if not rejoicing, those who buy as if not possessing, and
those who use the good things of the world as using them sparingly; for
this world as we see it is passing away. I want you to be free from
anxiety. The unmarried man is anxious about the Master's cause, desiring
to please him; while the married man is anxious about worldly matters,
desiring to please his wife; and so his interests are divided. Again,
the unmarried woman, whether she is old or young, is anxious about the
Master's cause, striving to be pure both in body and in spirit, while
the married woman is anxious about worldly matters, desiring to please
her husband. I say this for your own benefit, not with any intention of
putting a halter round your necks, but in order to secure for the Master
seemly and constant devotion, free from all distraction.
     If, however, a father thinks that he is not acting fairly by his
unmarried daughter, when she is past her youth, and if under these
circumstances her marriage ought to take place, he should act as he
thinks right. He is doing nothing wrong -- let the marriage take place.
On the other hand, a father, who has definitely made up his mind, and is
under no compulsion, but is free to carry out his own wishes, and who
has come to the decision, in his own mind, to keep his unmarried
daughter at home will be doing right. In short, the one who consents to
his daughter's marriage is doing right, and yet the other will be doing
better.
     A wife is bound to her husband as long as he lives; but, if the
husband should pass to his rest, the widow is free to marry anyone she
wishes, provided he is a believer. Yet she will be happier if she
remains as she is -- in my opinion, for I think that I also have the
Spirit of God.

     With reference to food that has been offered in sacrifice to idols
-- We are aware that all of us have knowledge! Knowledge breeds conceit,
while love builds up character. If someone thinks that they know
anything, they have not yet reached that knowledge which they ought to
have reached. On the other hand, if a person loves God, they are known
by God. With reference, then, to eating food that has been offered to
idols -- we are aware that an idol is nothing in the world, and that
there is no God but one. Even supposing that there are so-called "gods"
either in heaven or on earth -- and there are many such "gods" and
"lords" -- Yet for us there is only one God, the Father, from whom all
things come (and for him we live), and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through
whom all things come (and through him we live). Still, it is not
everyone that has this knowledge. Some people, because of their
association with idols, continued down to the present time, eat the food
as food offered to an idol; and their consciences, while still weak, are
dulled. What we eat, however, will not bring us nearer to God. We lose
nothing by not eating this food, and we gain nothing by eating it. But
take care that this right of yours does not become in any way a
stumbling-block to the weak. For if someone should see you who possess
this knowledge, feasting in an idol's temple, will not their conscience,
if they are weak, become so hardened that they, too, will eat food
offered to idols? And so, through this knowledge of yours, the weak
person is ruined -- someone for whose sake Christ died! In this way, by
sinning against your fellow followers of the Lord and injuring their
consciences, while still weak, you sin against Christ. Therefore, if
what I eat makes a follower of the Lord fall, rather than make them
fall, I will never eat meat again.

     Am I not free? Am I not an apostle? Have I not seen our Lord Jesus?
Aren't you yourselves my work achieved in union with the Lord? If I am
not an apostle to others, yet at least I am to you; for you are the seal
that stamps me as an apostle in union with the Lord. The defence that I
make to my critics is this: Haven't we a right to food and drink?
Haven't we a right to take a wife with us, if she is a Christian, as the
other apostles and the Master's brothers and Cephas all do? Or is it
only Barnabas and I who have no right to give up working for our bread?
Does anyone ever serve as a soldier at his own expense? Does anyone
plant a vineyard and not eat its produce? Or does anyone look after a
herd and not drink the milk? Am I, in all this, speaking only from the
human standpoint? Does not the Law also say the same? For in the Law of
Moses it is said --

     "You should not muzzle an ox while it is treading out the grain."

 Is it the bullocks that God is thinking of? Or is not is said entirely
for our sakes? Surely it was written for our sakes, for the ploughman
ought not to plough, nor the thrasher to thrash, without expecting a
share of the grain. Since we, then, sowed spiritual seed for you, is it
too much that we should reap from you an earthly harvest? If others
share in this right over you, don't we even more? Still we did not avail
ourselves of this right. No, we endure anything rather than impede the
progress of the good news of the Christ. Don't you know that those who
do the work of the Temple live on what comes from the Temple, and that
those who serve at the altar share the offerings with the altar? So,
too, the Master has appointed that those who tell the good news should
get their living from the good news. I, however, have not availed myself
of any of these rights. I am not saying this to secure such an
arrangement for myself; indeed, I would far rather die -- Nobody will
make my boast a vain one! If I proclaim the good news, I have nothing to
boast of, for I am compelled to do so. Woe is me if I do not share it!
If I do this work willingly, I have a reward; but, if unwillingly, I
have been charged to perform a duty. What is my reward, then? To present
the good news free of all cost, and so make but a sparing use of the
rights which it gives me.
     Although I was entirely free, yet, to win as many converts as
possible, I made myself everyone's slave. To the Jews I became like a
Jew, to win Jews. To those who are subject to Law I became like a man
subject to Law -- though I was not myself subject to Law -- to win those
who are subject to Law. To those who have no Law I became like a man who
has no Law -- not that I am free from God's Law; no, for I am under
Christ's Law -- to win those who have no law. To the weak I became weak,
to win the weak. I have become all things to all people, so as at all
costs to save some. And I do everything for the sake of the good news,
so that with them I may share in its blessings.
     Don't you know that on a racecourse, though all run, yet only one
wins the prize? Run in such a way that you may win. Every athlete
exercises self-restraint in everything; they, indeed, for a crown that
fades, we for one that is unfading. I, therefore, do not run aimlessly.
I do not box like a man hitting the air. No, I bruise my body and make
it my slave, so that I, who have called others to the contest, will not
myself be rejected.

     I want you to bear in mind, friends, that all our ancestors were
beneath the cloud, and all passed through the sea; that in the cloud and
in the sea they all underwent baptism as followers of Moses; and that
they all ate the same supernatural food, and all drank the same
supernatural water, for they used to drink from a supernatural rock
which followed them, and that rock was the Christ. Yet with most of them
God was displeased; for they were struck down in the desert. Now these
things happened as warnings to us, to teach us not to long for evil
things as our ancestors longed. Do not become idolaters, as some of them
became. Scripture says --

     "The people sat down to eat and drink, and stood up to dance."
 Nor let us act immorally, as some of them acted, with the result that
twenty-three thousand of them fell dead in a single day. Nor let us try
the patience of the Lord too far, as some of them tried it, with the
result that they were, one after another, destroyed by snakes. And do
not murmur, as some of them murmured, and so were destroyed by the angel
of death. These things happened to them by way of warning, and were
recorded to serve as a caution to us, in whose days the close of the
ages has come.
     Therefore let the person who thinks that they stand take care that
they do not fall. No temptation has come upon you that is not common to
all humanity. God will not fail you, and he will not allow you to be
tempted beyond your strength; but, when he sends the temptation, he will
also provide the way of escape, so that you may have strength to endure.

     Therefore, my dear friends, shun the worship of idols. I speak to
you as man of discernment; form your own judgment about what I am
saying. In the cup of blessing which we bless, is not there a sharing in
the blood of the Christ? And in the bread which we break, is not there a
sharing in the body of the Christ? The bread is one, and we, though
many, are one body; for we all partake of that one bread. Look at the
people of Israel. Do not those who eat the sacrifices share with the
altar? What do I mean? That an offering made to an idol, or the idol
itself, is anything? No; what I say is that the sacrifices offered by
the Gentiles are offered to demons and to a being who is no God, and I
do not want you to share with demons. You cannot drink both the cup of
the Lord and the cup of demons. You cannot partake at the table of the
Lord and at the table of demons. Or are we to rouse the jealousy of the
Lord? Are we stronger than he?
     Everything is allowable! Yes, but everything is not profitable.
Everything is allowable! Yes, but everything does not build up
character. A person must not study their own interests, but the
interests of others.
     Eat anything that is sold in the market, without making inquiries
to satisfy your scruples; for the earth, with all that is in it, belongs
to the Lord. If an unbeliever invites you to his house and you consent
to go, eat anything that is put before you, without making inquiries to
satisfy your scruples. But, if anyone should say to you "This has been
offered in sacrifice to an idol," then, for the sake of the speaker and
his scruples, do not eat it. I do not say your scruples, but his. For
why should the freedom that I claim be condemned by the scruples of
another? If, for my part, I take the food thankfully, why should I be
abused for eating that for which I give thanks?
     Whether, then, you eat or drink or whatever you do, do everything
to the honour of God. Do not cause offence either to Jews or Greeks or
to the church of God; for I, also, try to please everybody in
everything, not seeking my own advantage, but do what is best for
others, so that they may be saved.  Imitate me, as I myself imitate
Christ.

     I praise you, indeed, because you never forget me, and are keeping
my injunctions in mind, exactly as I laid them on you. But I am anxious
that you should understand that the Christ is the head of every man,
that man is the head of woman, and that God is the head of the Christ.
Any man who keeps his head covered, when praying or preaching in public,
dishonours him who is his head; while any woman, who prays or preaches
in public bare-headed, dishonours him who is her head; for that is to
make herself like one of the shameless women who shave their heads.
Indeed, if a woman does not keep her head covered, she may as well cut
her hair short. But, since to cut her hair short, or shave it off, marks
her as one of the shameless women, she should keep her head covered. A
man ought not to have his head covered, for he has been from the
beginning the likeness of God and the reflection of his glory, but woman
is the reflection of man's glory. For it was not man who was taken from
woman, but woman who was taken from man. Besides, man was not created
for the sake of woman, but woman for the sake of man. And, therefore, a
woman ought to wear on her head a symbol of her subjection, because of
the presence of the angels. Still, when in union with the Lord, woman is
not independent of man, or man of woman; for just as woman came from
man, so man comes by means of woman; and all things come from God. Judge
for yourselves. Is it fitting that a woman should pray to God in public
with her head uncovered? Does not nature herself teach us that, while
for a man to wear his hair long is degrading to him, a woman's long hair
is her glory? Her hair has been given her to serve as a covering. If,
however, anyone still thinks it right to contest the point -- well, we
have no such custom, nor have the churches of God.

     In giving directions on the next subject, I cannot praise you;
because your meetings do more harm than good. To begin with, I am told
that when you meet together as a church there are divisions among you.
In part I believe this, indeed, there must be parties among you, so that
the people of real worth become known. When you meet together, as I
understand, it is not possible to eat the Lord's Supper; for, as you
eat, each of you tries to secure his own supper first, with the result
that one has too little to eat, and another has too much to drink! Have
you no houses in which you can eat and drink? Or are you trying to show
your contempt for the church of God, and to humiliate the poor? What can
I say to you? Should I praise you? In this matter I cannot praise you.
For I myself received from the Lord the account which I have in turn
given to you -- how the Lord Jesus, on the very night of his betrayal,
took some bread, and, after saying the thanksgiving, broke it and said
'This is my own body given on your behalf. Do this in memory of me.' And
in the same way with the cup, after supper, saying 'This cup is the new
covenant made by my blood. Do this, whenever you drink it, in memory of
me.' For whenever you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the
Lord's death -- until he comes. Therefore, whoever eats the bread, or
drinks the Lord's cup, in an irreverent spirit, will have to answer for
an offence against the Lord's body and blood. Let everyone look into
their own heart, and only then eat of the bread and drink from the cup.
For the person who eats and drinks brings a judgment on themselves by
their eating and drinking, when they do not discern the body. That is
why so many among you are weak and ill, and why some are sleeping. But,
if we judged ourselves rightly, we should not be judged. Yet, in being
judged by the Lord, we are undergoing discipline, so that we may not
have judgment passed on us with the rest of the world. Therefore, my
friends, when you meet together to eat the Supper, wait for one another.
If anyone is hungry, they should eat at home, so that your meetings may
not bring a judgment on you. The other details I will settle when I
come.

     In the next place, friends, I do not want you to be ignorant about
spiritual gifts. You know that there was a time when you were Gentiles,
going astray after idols that could not speak, just as you happened to
be led. Therefore I tell you plainly that no one who speaks under the
influence of the Spirit of God says "JESUS IS ACCURSED," and that no one
can say "JESUS IS LORD," except under the influence of the Holy Spirit.
Gifts differ, but the Spirit is the same; ways of serving differ, yet
the Master is the same; results differ, yet the God who brings about
every result is in every case the same. To each of us there is given
spiritual illumination for the general good. To one is given the power
to speak with wisdom through the Spirit; to another the power to speak
with knowledge, due to the same Spirit; to another faith by the same
Spirit; to another power to cure diseases by the one Spirit; to another
supernatural powers; to another the gift of preaching; to another the
gift of distinguishing between true and false inspiration; to another
varieties of the gift of "tongues"; to another the power to interpret
"tongues." All these result from one and the same Spirit, who
distributes his gifts to each individually as he wills.
     For just as the human body is one whole, and yet has many parts,
and all its parts, many though they are, form but one body, so it is
with the Christ; for it was by one Spirit that we were all baptised to
form one body, whether Jews or Greeks, slaves or free, and were all
imbued with one Spirit. The human body, I repeat, consists not of one
part, but of many. If the foot says "Since I am not a hand, I do not
belong to the body," it does not because of that cease to belong to the
body. Or if the ear says "Since I am not an eye, I do not belong to the
body," it does not because of that cease to belong to the body. If all
the body were an eye, where would the hearing be? If it were all
hearing, where would the sense of smell be? But in fact God has placed
each individual part just where he thought fit in the body. If, however,
they all made up only one part, where would the body be? But in fact,
although it has many parts, there is only one body. The eye cannot say
to the hand "I do not need you," nor, again, the head to the feet "I do
not need you." No! Those parts of the body that seem naturally the
weaker are indispensable; and those parts which we deem less honourable
we surround with special honour; and our ungraceful parts receive a
special grace which our graceful parts do not require. Yes, God has so
constructed the body -- by giving a special honour to the part that
lacks it -- As to secure that there should be no disunion in the body,
but that the parts should show the same care for one another. If one
part suffers, all the others suffer with it, and if one part has honour
done to it, all the others share its joy. Together you are the body of
Christ, and individually its parts. In the church God has appointed,
first, apostles, secondly preachers, thirdly teachers; then he has given
supernatural powers, then power to cure diseases, aptness for helping
others, capacity to govern, varieties of the gift of "tongues." Can
everyone be an apostle? Can everyone be a preacher? Can everyone be a
teacher? Can everyone have supernatural powers? Can everyone have power
to cure diseases? Can everyone speak in "tongues"? Can everyone
interpret them? Strive for the greater gifts.

    Yet I can still show you a way beyond all comparison the best.
Though I speak in the "tongues" of people, or even of angels, yet have
not love, I have become mere echoing brass, or a clanging cymbal! Even
though I have the gift of preaching, and fathom all hidden truths and
all the depths of knowledge; even though I have such faith as might move
mountains, yet have not love, I am nothing! Even though I dole my
substance to the poor, even though I sacrifice my body in order to
boast, yet have not love, it avails me nothing! Love is long-suffering,
and kind; love is never envious, never boastful, never conceited, never
behaves unbecomingly; love is never self-seeking, never provoked, never
reckons up her wrongs; love never rejoices at evil, but rejoices in the
triumph of truth; love bears with all things, ever trustful, ever
hopeful, ever patient. Love never fails. But, whether it be the gift of
preaching, it will end; whether it be the gift of "tongues," it will
cease; whether it be knowledge, it, too, will vanish. For our knowledge
is incomplete, and our preaching is incomplete, but, when the perfect
has come, that which is incomplete will end. When I was a child, I
talked as a child, I felt as a child, I reasoned as a child; now that I
am a man, I have done with childish ways. As yet we see, in a mirror,
dimly, but then -- face to face! As yet my knowledge is incomplete, but
then I will know in full, as I have been fully known. Meanwhile faith,
hope, and love endure -- these three, but the greatest of these is love.
Seek this love earnestly, and strive for spiritual gifts, above all for
the gift of preaching. The person who, when speaking, uses the gift of
"tongues" is speaking, not to people, but to God, for no one understands
them; yet in spirit they are speaking of hidden truths. But those who
preach are speaking to their fellow men and women words that will build
up faith, and give them comfort and encouragement. Those who, when
speaking, use the gift of "tongues" builds up their own faith, while
those who preach build up the faith of the church. Now I want you all to
speak in "tongues," but much more I wish that you should preach. A
preacher is worth more than one who speaks in "tongues," unless they
interprets their words, so that the faith of the church may be built up.
This being so, friends, what good will I do you, if I come to you and
speak in "tongues," unless my words convey some revelation, or
knowledge, or take the form of preaching or teaching? Even with
inanimate things, such as a flute or a harp, though they produce sounds,
yet unless the notes are quite distinct, how can the tune played on the
flute or the harp be recognised? If the bugle sounds a doubtful call,
who will prepare for battle? And so with you; unless, in using the gift
of "tongues," you utter intelligible words, how can what you say be
understood? You will be speaking to the winds! There are, for instance,
a certain number of different languages in the world, and not one of
them fails to convey meaning. If, however, I do not happen to know the
language, I will be a foreigner to those who speak it, and they will be
foreigners to me. And so with you; since you are striving for spiritual
gifts, be eager to excel in such as will build up the faith of the
church. Therefore anyone who, when speaking, uses the gift of "tongues"
should pray for ability to interpret them. If, when praying, I use the
gift of "tongues," my spirit indeed prays, but my mind is a blank. What,
then, is my conclusion? Simply this -- I will pray with my spirit, but
with my mind as well; I will sing with my spirit, but with my mind as
well. If you bless God with your spirit only, how can people in the
congregation who are without your gift say "Amen" to your thanksgiving?
They do not know what you are saying! Your thanksgiving may be
excellent, but the other is not helped by it. Thank God, I use the gift
of "tongues" more than any of you. But at a meeting of the church I
would rather speak five words with my mind, and so teach others, than
ten thousand words when using the gift of "tongues."
     My friends, do not show yourselves children in understanding. In
wickedness be infants, but in understanding show yourselves adults. It
is said in the Law --

     "In strange tongues and by the lips of strangers will I speak to
this people, but even then they will not listen to me, says the Lord."
 Therefore the gift of the "tongues" is intended as a sign, not for
those who believe in Christ, but for those who do not, while the gift of
preaching is intended as a sign, not for those who do not believe in
Christ, but for those who do. So, when the whole church meets, if all
present use the gift of "tongues," and some people who are without the
gift, or who are unbelievers, come in, will not they say that you are
mad? While, if all those present use the gift of preaching, and an
unbeliever, or someone without the gift, comes in, they are convinced of
their sinfulness by them all, they are called to account by them all;
the secrets of their heart are revealed, and then, throwing themselves
on their face, they will worship God, and declare "God is indeed among
you!"
     What do I suggest, then, friends? Whenever you meet for worship,
each of you comes, either with a hymn, or a lesson, or a revelation, or
the gift of "tongues," or the interpretation of them; let everything be
directed to the building up of faith. If any of you use the gift of
"tongues," not more than two, or at the most three, should do so -- each
speaking in his turn -- and someone should interpret them. If there is
no one able to interpret what is said, they should remain silent at the
meeting of the church, and speak to themselves and to God. Of preachers
two or three should speak, and the rest should weigh well what is said.
But, if some revelation is made to another person as he sits there, the
first speaker should stop. For you can all preach in turn, so that all
may learn some lesson and all receive encouragement. (The spirit that
moves the preachers is within the preachers' control; for God is not a
God of disorder, but of peace.) This custom prevails in all the churches
of Christ's people.

     At the meetings of the church married women should remain silent,
for they are not allowed to speak in public; they should take a
subordinate place, as the Law itself directs. If they want information
on any point, they should ask their husbands about it at home; for it is
unbecoming for a married woman to speak at a meeting of the church.
What! Did God's message to the world originate with you? Or did it find
its way to none but you?
     If anyone thinks that he has the gift of preaching or any other
spiritual gift, he should recognise that what I am now saying to you is
a command from the Lord. Anyone who ignores it may be ignored.
Therefore, my friends, strive for the gift of preaching, and yet do not
forbid speaking in "tongues." Let everything be done in a proper and
orderly manner.

*The Apostle's Teaching as to the Resurrection of the Dead*

     Next, friends, I would like to remind you of the good news which I
told you, and which you received -- the good news on which you have
taken your stand, and by means of which you are being saved. I would
like to remind you of the words that I used in telling it to you, since
you are still holding fast to it, and since it was not in vain that you
became believers in Christ. For at the very beginning of my teaching I
gave you the account which I had myself received -- that Christ died for
our sins (as the scriptures had foretold), that he was buried, that on
the third day he was raised (as the scriptures had foretold), and that
he appeared to Cephas, and then to the Twelve. After that, he appeared
to more than five hundred of his followers at one time, most of whom are
still alive, though some have gone to their rest. After that, he
appeared to James, and then to all the apostles. Last of all, he
appeared even to me, who am, as it were, a miscarried baby -- born
untimely. For I am the least of the apostles, I who am unworthy of the
name of "apostle," because I persecuted the church of God. But it is
through the love of God that I am what I am, and the love that he showed
me has not been wasted. No, I have toiled harder than any of them, and
yet it was not I, but the love of God working with me. Whether, then, it
was I or whether it was they, this we proclaim, and this you believed.

     Now, if it is proclaimed of Christ that he has been raised from the
dead, how is it that some of you say that there is no such thing as a
resurrection of the dead? But, if there is no such thing as a
resurrection of the dead, then even Christ has not been raised; and, if
Christ has not been raised, then our proclamation is without meaning,
and our faith without meaning also! Yes, and we are being proved to have
borne false testimony about God; for we testified of God that he raised
the Christ, whom he did not raise, if, indeed, the dead do not rise!
For, if the dead do not rise, then even Christ himself has not been
raised, and, if Christ has not been raised, your faith is folly -- your
sins are on you still! Yes, and they, who have passed to their rest in
union with Christ, perished! If all that we have done has been to place
our hope in Christ for this life, then we of all people are the most to
be pitied.
     But, in truth, Christ has been raised from the dead, the first-
fruits of those who are at rest. For, since through a man there is
death, so, too, through a man there is a resurrection of the dead. For,
as through union with Adam all die, so through union with the Christ
will all be made to live. But each in their proper order -- Christ the
first-fruits; afterwards, at his coming, those who belong to the Christ.
Then will come the end -- when he surrenders the kingdom to his God and
Father, having overthrown all other rule and all other authority and
power. For he must reign until God "has put all his enemies under his
feet." The last enemy to be overthrown is death; for God has placed all
things under Christ's feet. (But, when it is said that all things have
been placed under Christ, it is plain that God is excepted who placed
everything under him.) And, when everything has been placed under him,
the Son will place himself under God who placed everything under him, so
that God may be all in all! Again, what good will they be doing who are
baptised on behalf of the dead? If it is true that the dead do not rise,
why are people baptised on their behalf? Why, too, do we risk our lives
every hour? Daily I face death -- I swear it, friends, by the pride in
you that I feel through my union with Christ Jesus, our Lord. If with
only human hopes I had fought in the arena at Ephesus, what should I
have gained by it? If the dead do not rise, then let us eat and drink,
for tomorrow we will die! Do not be deceived.

     "Good character is marred by evil company."
 Wake up to a righteous life, and cease to sin. There are some who have
no true knowledge of God. I speak in this way to shame you.

     Someone, however, may ask "How do the dead rise? And in what body
will they come?" You foolish person! The seed you yourself sow does not
come to life, unless it dies! And when you sow, you sow not the body
that will be, but a mere grain -- perhaps of wheat, or something else.
God gives it the body that he pleases -- to each seed its special body.
All forms of life are not the same; there is one for people, another for
beasts, another for birds, and another for fish. There are heavenly
bodies, and earthly bodies; but the beauty of the heavenly bodies is not
the beauty of the earthly. There is a beauty of the sun, and a beauty of
the moon, and a beauty of the stars; for even star differs from star in
beauty. It is the same with the resurrection of the dead. Sown a mortal
body, it rises immortal; sown disfigured, it rises beautiful; sown weak,
it rises strong; sown a human body, it rises a spiritual body. As surely
as there is a human body, there is also a spiritual body. That is what
is meant by the words -- "Adam, the first man, became a human being";
the last Adam became a life-giving spirit. That which comes first is not
the spiritual, but the human; afterwards comes the spiritual; the first
man was from the dust of the earth; the second man from heaven. Those
who are of the dust are like him who came from the dust; and those who
are of heaven are like him who came from heaven. And as we have borne
the likeness of him who came from the dust, so let us bear the likeness
of him who came from heaven. This I say, friends -- Flesh and blood can
have no share in the kingdom of God, nor can the perishable share the
imperishable. Listen, I will tell you God's hidden purpose! We will not
all have passed to our rest, but we will all be transformed -- in a
moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet-call; for the
trumpet will sound, and the dead will rise immortal, and we, also, will
be transformed. For this perishable body of ours must put on an
imperishable form, and this dying body a deathless form. And, when this
dying body has put on its deathless form, then indeed will the words of
scripture come true --

     "death has been swallowed up in victory! Where, Death, is your
victory? Where, death, is your sting?"
 It is sin that gives death its sting, and it is the Law that gives sin
its power. But thanks be to God, who gives us the victory, through Jesus
Christ, our Lord. Therefore, my dear friends, stand firm, unshaken,
always diligent in the Lord's work, for you know that, in union with
him, your toil is not in vain.

*Conclusion*

     With reference to the collection for Christ's people, I want you to
follow the instructions that I gave to the churches in Galatia. On the
first day of every week each of you should put by what he can afford, so
that no collections need be made after I have come. On my arrival, I
will send any persons, whom you may authorise by letter, to carry your
gift to Jerusalem; and, if it appears to be worth while for me to go
also, they will go with me.
     I will come to you as soon as I have been through Macedonia -- for
I am going through Macedonia -- And I will probably make some stay with
you or, perhaps, remain for the winter, so that you may yourselves send
me on my way, wherever I may be going. I do not propose to pay you a
visit in passing now, for I hope to stay with you for some time, if the
Lord permits. I intend, however, staying at Ephesus until the Festival
at the close of the Harvest; for a great opening for active work has
presented itself, and there are many opponents.
     If Timothy comes, take care that he has no cause for feeling
anxious while he is with you. He is doing the Master's work no less than
I am. No one, therefore, should slight him. See him safely on his way to
me, for I am expecting him with some of our friends.
     As for our friend Apollos, I have often urged him to go to you with
the others. He has, however, been very unwilling to do so as yet; but he
will go as soon as he finds a good opportunity.
     Be watchful; stand firm in your faith; be brave; be strong. Let
everything you do be done in a loving spirit.
     I have another request to make of you, friends. You remember
Stephanas and his household, and that they were the first-fruits
gathered in from Greece, and set themselves to serve Christ's people. I
want you, on your part, to show deference to such people as these, as
well as to every fellow labourer and earnest worker. I am glad Stephanas
and Fortunatus and Achaicus have come, for they have made up for your
absence; they have cheered my heart, and your hearts also. Recognise the
worth of such people as these.

     The churches in Roman Asia send you their greetings. Aquila and
Prisca and the church that meets at their house send you many Christian
greetings. All of the Lord's followers send you greetings. Greet one
another with a sacred kiss.
     I, Paul, add this greeting in my own handwriting. Accursed be
anyone who has no love for the Lord. THE LORD IS COMING. May the
blessing of the Lord Jesus be with you. My love to all of you who are in
union with Christ Jesus.

                      PAUL'S SECOND LETTER TO THE
                              CORINTHIANS


*Introduction*

     To the church of God in Corinth, and to all Christ's people
throughout Greece, from Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus, by the will of
God, and from Timothy, who is also a follower. May God, our Father, and
the Lord Jesus Christ bless you and give you peace.

     Blessed is the God and Father of Jesus Christ our Lord, the all-
merciful Father, the God ever ready to console, who consoles us in all
our troubles, so that we may be able to console those who are in any
trouble with the consolation that we ourselves receive from him. It is
true that we have our full share of the sufferings of the Christ, but
through the Christ we have also our full share of consolation. If we
meet with trouble, it is for the sake of your consolation and salvation;
and, if we find consolation, it is for the sake of the consolation that
you will experience when you are called to endure the sufferings that we
ourselves are enduring; and our hope for you remains unshaken. We know
that, as you are sharing our sufferings, you will also share our
consolation. We want you, friends, to know that, in the troubles which
befell us in Roman Asia, we were burdened altogether beyond our
strength, so much so that we even despaired of life. Indeed, we had the
presentiment that we must die, so that we might rely, not on ourselves,
but on God who raises the dead. And from so imminent a death God
delivered us, and will deliver us again; for in him we have placed our
hopes of future deliverance, while you, also, help us by your prayers.
And then many lips will give thanks on our behalf for the blessing
granted us in answer to many prayers.

*The Apostle's Relations with his Converts*

     Indeed, our main ground for satisfaction is this -- Our conscience
tells us that our conduct in the world, and still more in our relations
with you, was marked by a purity of motive and a sincerity that were
inspired by God, and was based, not on worldly policy, but on the help
of God. We never write anything to you other than what you will
acknowledge to the very end -- And, indeed, you have already partly
acknowledged it about us -- that you have a right to be proud of us, as
we will be proud of you, on the day of our Lord Jesus.

     With this conviction in my mind, I planned to come to see you
first, so that your pleasure might be doubled -- To visit you both on my
way to Macedonia, and to come to you again on my return from Macedonia,
and then to get you to send me on my way into Judea. As this was my
plan, where, pray, did I show any fickleness of purpose? Or do you think
that my plans are formed on mere impulse, so that in the same breath I
say "Yes" and "No"? As God is true, the message that we brought you does
not waver between "Yes" and "No"! The Son of God, Christ Jesus, whom we
-- Silas, Timothy, and I -- proclaimed among you, never wavered between
"Yes" and "No." With him it has always been "Yes." For, many as were the
promises of God, in Christ is the "Yes" that fulfils them. Therefore,
through Christ again, let the "Amen" rise, through us, to the glory of
God. God who brings us, with you, into close union with Christ, and who
consecrated us, also set his seal on us, and gave us his Spirit in our
hearts as a pledge of future blessings.
     But, as my life will answer for it, I call God to witness that it
was to spare you that I deferred my visit to Corinth. I do not mean that
we are to dictate to you with regard to your faith; on the contrary, we
work with you for your true happiness; indeed, it is through your faith
that you are standing firm.  For my own sake, as well, I decided not to
pay you another painful visit. If it is I who cause you pain, why, who
is there to cheer me, except the person whom I am paining? So I wrote as
I did because I was afraid that if I had come, I should have been pained
by those who ought to have made me glad; for I felt sure that it was
true of you all that my joy was in every case yours also. I wrote to you
in sore trouble and distress of heart and with many tears, not to give
you pain, but to let you see how intense a love I have for you.
     Now whoever has caused the pain has not so much pained me, as he
has, to some extent -- not to be too severe -- pained every one of you.
The man to whom I refer has been sufficiently punished by the penalty
inflicted by the majority of you; so that now you must take the opposite
course, and forgive and encourage him, or else he may be overwhelmed by
the intensity of his pain. So I entreat you to assure him of your love.
I had this further object, also, in what I wrote -- to find out whether
you might be relied on to be obedient in everything. Anyone you forgive,
I forgive them, too. Indeed, for my part, whatever I have forgiven (if I
have had to forgive anything), I have forgiven for your sakes, in the
presence of Christ, so as to prevent Satan from taking advantage of us;
for we are not ignorant of his devices.
     When I went to the district round Troas to tell the good news of
the Christ, even though there was an opening for serving the Master, I
could get no peace of mind because I failed to find Titus, my friend; so
I took leave of the people there, and went on to Macedonia. All thanks
to God, who, through our union with the Christ, leads us in one
continual triumph, and uses us to spread the sweet perfume of the
knowledge of him in every place. For we are the fragrance of Christ
ascending to God -- both among those who are in the path of salvation
and among those who are in the path to ruin. To the latter we are a
stench which arises from death and tells of death; to the former a
fragrance which arises from life and tells of life. But who is equal to
such a task? Unlike many people, we are not in the habit of making
profit out of God's message; but in all sincerity, and bearing God's
commission, we speak before him in union with Christ.

     Are we beginning to commend ourselves again? Or are we like some
who need letters of commendation to you, or from you? You yourselves are
our letter -- a letter written on our hearts, and one which everybody
can read and understand. All can see that you are a letter from Christ
delivered by us, a letter written, not with ink, but with the Spirit of
the living God, not on tablets of stone, but on tablets of human hearts.

*The Ministry of the Apostles*

     This, then, is the confidence in regard to God that we have gained
through the Christ. I do not mean that we are fit to form any judgment
by ourselves, as if on our own authority; our fitness comes from God,
who himself made us fit to be assistants of a new covenant, of which the
substance is, not a written Law, but a Spirit. For the written Law means
death, but the Spirit gives life.
     If the system of religion which involved death, embodied in a
written Law and engraved on stones, began amid such glory, that the
Israelites were unable to gaze at the face of Moses because of its
glory, though it was but a passing glory, will not the religion that
confers the Spirit have still greater glory? For, if there was a glory
in the religion that involved condemnation, far greater is the glory of
the religion that confers righteousness! Indeed, that which then had
glory has lost its glory, because of the glory which surpasses it. And,
if that which was to pass away was attended with glory, far more will
that which is to endure be surrounded with glory!
     With such a hope as this, we speak with all plainness; unlike
Moses, who covered his face with a veil, to prevent the Israelites from
gazing at the disappearance of what was passing away. But their minds
were slow to learn. Indeed, to this very day, at the public reading of
the old covenant, the same veil remains; only for those who are in union
with Christ does it pass away. But, even to this day, whenever Moses is
read, a veil lies on their hearts. Yet, whenever someone turns to the
Lord, the veil is removed. And the Lord is the Spirit, and, where the
Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom. And all of us, with faces from
which the veil is lifted, seeing, as if reflected in a mirror, the glory
of the Lord, are being transformed into his likeness, from glory to
glory, as it is given by the Lord, the Spirit.
     Therefore, since it is by God's mercy that we are engaged in this
ministry, we do not lose heart. No, we have renounced the secrecy
prompted by shame, refusing to adopt crafty ways, or to tamper with
God's message, and commending ourselves to everyone's conscience, in the
sight of God, by our exhibition of the truth. And, even if the good news
that we bring is veiled, it is veiled only in the case of those who are
on the path to ruin -- people whose minds have been blinded by the God
of this age, unbelievers as they are, so that the light from the good
news of the glory of the Christ, who is the incarnation of God, should
not shine for them. (For it is not ourselves that we proclaim, but
Christ Jesus, as Lord, and ourselves as your servants for Jesus' sake.)
Indeed, the same God who said "Out of darkness light will shine," has
shone in on our hearts, so that we should bring out into the light the
knowledge of the glory of God, seen in the face of Christ.

     This treasure we have in these earthen vessels, so that its all-
prevailing power may be seen to come from God, and not to be our own.
Though hard pressed on every side, we are never hemmed in; though
perplexed, never driven to despair; though pursued, never abandoned;
though struck down, never killed! We always bear on our bodies the marks
of the death that Jesus died, so that the life also of Jesus may be
exhibited in our bodies. Indeed, we who still live are continually being
given over to death for Jesus' sake, so that the life also of Jesus may
be exhibited in our mortal nature. And so, while death is at work within
us, life is at work within you. But, in the same spirit of faith as that
expressed in the words -- "I believed, and therefore I spoke," we, also
believe, and therefore speak. For we know that he who raised the Lord
Jesus will raise us also with him, and will bring us, with you, into his
presence. For all this is for your sakes, so that the loving kindness of
God, spreading from heart to heart, may cause yet more hearts to
overflow with thanksgiving, to his glory.
     Therefore, as I said, we do not lose heart. No, even though
outwardly we are wasting away, yet inwardly we are being renewed day by
day. The light burden of our momentary trouble is preparing for us a
weight of imperishable glory, beyond all measure. We, all the while,
gaze not on what is seen, but on what is unseen. For what is seen is
transient, but what is unseen is imperishable.  For we know that if our
tent -- that earthly body which is now our home -- is taken down, we
have a house of God's building, a home not made by hands, imperishable,
in heaven. Even while in our present body we sigh, longing to put over
it our heavenly house, sure that, when we have put it on, we will never
be found naked. For we who are in this tent sigh under our burden,
unwilling to take it off, yet wishing to put our heavenly body over it,
so that all that is mortal may be absorbed in life. And he who has
prepared us for this change is God, who has also given us his Spirit as
a pledge.
     Therefore we are always confident, knowing that, while our home is
in the body, we are absent from our home with the Lord. For we guide our
lives by faith, and not by what we see. And in this confidence we would
gladly leave our home in the body, and make our home with the Lord.
Therefore, whether in our home or absent from our home, our one ambition
is to please him. For at the court of the Christ we must all appear in
our true characters, so that each may reap the results of the life which
he has lived in the body, in accordance with his actions -- whether good
or worthless.

     Therefore, because we know the fear inspired by the Lord, it is
true that we are trying to win people over, but our motives are plain to
God; and I hope that in your inmost hearts they are plain to you also.
We are not 'commending ourselves' again to you, but rather are giving
you cause for pride in us, so that you may have an answer ready for
those who pride themselves on appearances and not on character. For, if
we were 'beside ourselves,' it was in God's service! If we are not in
our senses, it is in yours! It is the love of the Christ which compels
us, when we reflect that, as one died for all, therefore all died; and
that he died for all, so that the living should no longer live for
themselves, but for him who died and rose for them.
     For ourselves, then, from this time forward, we refuse to regard
anyone from the world's standpoint. Even if we once thought of Christ
from the standpoint of the world, yet now we do so no longer. Therefore,
if anyone is in union with Christ, he is a new being! His old life has
passed away; a new life has begun! But all this is the work of God, who
reconciled us to himself through Christ, and gave us the ministry of
reconciliation -- To proclaim that God, in Christ, was reconciling the
world to himself, not reckoning people's offences against them, and that
he had entrusted us with the message of this reconciliation.
     It is, then, on Christ's behalf that we are acting as ambassadors,
God, as it were, appealing to you through us. We implore you on Christ's
behalf -- Be reconciled to God. For our sake God made Christ, who was
innocent of sin, one with our sinfulness, so that in him we might be
made one with the righteousness of God.  Therefore, as God's fellow
workers, we also appeal to you not to receive his loving kindness in
vain. For he says --

     "At the time for acceptance I listened to you,
     and on the day of deliverance I helped you."
 Now is the time for acceptance! Now is the day of deliverance! Never do
we put an obstacle in anyone's way, so that no fault may be found with
our ministry. No, we are trying to commend ourselves under all
circumstances, as God's assistants should -- in many an hour of
endurance, in troubles, in hardships, in difficulties, in floggings, in
imprisonments, in riots, in toils, in sleepless nights, in hunger; by
purity, by knowledge, by patience, by kindliness, by holiness of spirit,
by unfeigned love; by the message of truth, and by the power of God; by
the weapons of righteousness in the right hand and in the left; amid
honour and disrepute, amid slander and praise; regarded as deceivers,
yet proved to be true; as unknown, yet well-known; as at death's door,
yet, see, we are living; as chastised, yet not killed; as saddened, yet
always rejoicing; as poor, yet enriching many; as having nothing, and
yet possessing all things!

*The Apostle and his Converts*

     We have been speaking freely to you, dear friends in Corinth; we
have opened our heart; there is room there for you, yet there is not
room, in your love, for us. Can you not in return -- I appeal to you as
I should to children -- open your hearts to us?
     Do not enter into inconsistent relations with those who reject the
faith. For what partnership can there be between righteousness and
lawlessness? Or what has light to do with darkness? What harmony can
there be between Christ and Belial? Or what can those who accept the
faith have in common with those who reject it? What agreement can there
be between a temple of God and idols? And we are a temple of the living
God. That is what God meant when he said --

     "I will live among them, and walk among them;
         and I will be their God, and they will be my people.
     Therefore 'Come out from among the nations, and separate yourselves
from them,' says the Lord,
     'And touch nothing impure;
         and I will welcome you;
     and I will be a father to you, and you will be my sons and
daughters,'
         says the Lord, the Ruler of all."
  With these promises, dear friends, let us purify ourselves from
everything that pollutes either body or spirit, and, in deepest respect
for God, aim at perfect holiness.
     Make room for us in your hearts. In no instance have we ever
wronged, or harmed, or taken advantage of, anyone. I am not saying this
to condemn you. Indeed, I have already said that you are in our heart,
to live and die together. I have the utmost confidence in you; I am
always boasting about you. I am full of encouragement and, in spite of
all our troubles, my heart is overflowing with happiness.
     Ever since we reached Macedonia, we have had no rest in body or
mind; on every side there have been troubles -- conflicts without,
anxieties within. But God, who encourages the downcast, has encouraged
us by the arrival of Titus. And it is not only by his arrival that we
are encouraged, but also by the encouragement which he received from
you; for he tells us of your strong affection, your penitence, and your
zeal on my behalf -- so that I am happier still. For, though I caused
you sorrow by my letter, I do not regret it. Even if I were inclined to
regret it -- for I see that my letter did cause you sorrow though only
for a time -- I am glad now; not because of the sorrow it caused you,
but because your sorrow brought you to repentance. For it was God's will
that you should feel sorrow, in order that you should not suffer loss in
any way at our hands. For, when sorrow is in accordance with God's will,
it results in a repentance leading to salvation, and which will never be
regretted. The sure result of the sorrow that the world knows is death.
For see what results that other sorrow -- sorrow in accordance with
God's will -- has had in your case. What earnestness it produced! What
explanations! What strong feeling! What alarm! What longing! What
eagerness! What readiness to punish! You have proved yourselves
altogether free from guilt in that matter. So, then, even though I did
write to you, it was not for the sake of the wrongdoer, or of the man
who was wronged, but to make you conscious, in the sight of God, of your
own earnest care for us. And it is this that has encouraged us.
     In addition to the encouragement that this gave us, we were made
far happier still by the happiness of Titus for his heart has been
cheered by you all. Although I have been boasting a little to him about
you, you did not put me to shame; but, just as every thing we had said
to you was true, so our boasting to Titus about you has also proved to
be the truth. And his affection for you is all the greater, as he
remembers the deference that you all showed him, and recalls how you
received him with anxious care. I am glad that I can feel perfect
confidence in you.

*The Palestine Famine Fund*

     We want to remind you, friends, of the love that God has shown to
the churches in Macedonia -- How, tired though they were by many a
trouble, their overflowing happiness, and even their deep poverty,
resulted in a flood of generosity. I can bear witness that to the full
extent of their power, and even beyond their power, spontaneously, and
with many an appeal to us for permission, they showed their love, and
contributed their share towards the fund for their fellow Christians.
And that, not only in the way we had expected; but first they gave
themselves to the Lord, and to us also, in accordance with God's will.
And this led us to beg Titus, that since he had started the work for
you, he should also see to the completion of this expression of your
love. And, remembering how you excel in everything -- in faith, in
teaching, in knowledge, in unfailing earnestness, and in the affection
that we have awakened in you -- I ask you to excel also in this
expression of your love.
     I am not laying a command on you, but I am making use of the
earnestness shown by others to test the genuineness of your affection.
For you do not forget the loving kindness of our Lord Jesus Christ --
how that for your sakes, although he was rich, he became poor, so that
you also might become rich through his poverty. I am only making
suggestions on this matter; for this is the best course for you, since
you were a year before others, not only in taking action, but also in
showing your readiness to do so. And now I want you to complete the
work, so that its completion may correspond with your willing readiness
-- in proportion, of course, to your means. For, where there is
willingness, a person's gift is valued by its comparison with what they
have, and not with what they do not have. For our object is not to give
relief to others and bring distress on you. It is a matter of a fair
balance. On this occasion what you can spare will supply what they need,
at another time what they can spare may supply your need, and so things
will be equal. As scripture says --

     "Those who had much had nothing over, and those who had little did
not lack!"
 I thank God for inspiring Titus with the same keen interest in your
welfare that I have; for Titus has responded to my appeals and, in his
great earnestness, is starting to go to you of his own accord. We are
sending with him one of the Lord's followers whose fame in the service
of the good news has spread through all the churches; and not only that,
but he has been elected by the churches to accompany us on our journey,
in connexion with this expression of your love, which we are personally
administering to the honour of the Lord, and to show our deep interest.
What we are specially guarding against is that any fault should be found
with us in regard to our administration of this charitable fund; for we
are trying to make arrangements which will be right, not only in the
eyes of the Lord, but also in the eyes of people. We are also sending
with them another of our friends, whose earnestness we have many a time
proved in many ways, and whom we now find made even more earnest by his
great confidence in you. If I must say anything about Titus, he is my
intimate companion, and he shares my work for you; if it is our friends,
they are delegates of the churches, an honour to Christ. Show them,
therefore -- so that the churches may see it -- the proof of your
affection, and the ground for our boasting to them about you.
     With reference, indeed, to the fund for your fellow Christians, it
is quite superfluous for me to say anything to you. I know, of course,
your willingness to help, and I am always boasting of it to the
Macedonians. I tell them that you in Greece have been ready for a year
past; and it was really your zeal that stimulated most of them. So my
reason for sending our friends is to prevent what we said about you from
proving, in this particular matter, an empty boast, and to enable you to
be as well prepared as I have been saying that you are. Otherwise, if
any Macedonians were to come with me, and find you unprepared, we -- to
say nothing of you -- should feel ashamed of our present confidence.
Therefore I think it necessary to beg the friends to go to you in
advance, and to complete the arrangements for the gift, which you have
already promised, so that it may be ready, as a gift, before I come, and
not look as if it were being given under pressure.
     Remember the saying -- "Scanty sowing, scanty harvest; plentiful
sowing, plentiful harvest." Let everyone give as he has determined
before hand, not grudgingly or under compulsion; for God loves a
cheerful giver. God has power to shower all kinds of blessings on you,
so that, having, under all circumstances and on all occasions, all that
you can need, you may be able to shower all kinds of benefits on others.
(As scripture says --

     "He shared freely, he gave to the poor; his righteousness continues
for ever."
 And he who supplies seed to the sower, and bread for eating, will
supply you with seed, and cause it to increase, and will multiply the
fruits of your righteousness). Rich in all things yourselves, you will
be able to show liberality to all, which, with our help, will cause
thanksgiving to be offered to God. For the rendering of a public service
such as this, not only relieves the needs of your fellow Christians, but
also results in the offering to God of many a thanksgiving. Through the
evidence afforded by the service rendered, you cause people to praise
God for your fidelity to your profession of faith in the good news of
the Christ, as well as for the liberality of your contributions for them
and for all others. And they also, in their prayers for you, express
their longing to see you, because of the surpassing love of God
displayed toward you. All thanks to God for his inestimable gift!

*The Apostle's Claims and Authority*

     Now, I, Paul, make a personal appeal to you by the meekness and
gentleness of the Christ -- I who, 'in your presence, am humble in my
bearing towards you, but, when absent, am bold in my language to you' --
I implore you not to drive me to 'show my boldness,' when I do come, by
the confident tone which I expect to have to adopt towards some of you,
who are expecting to find us influenced in our conduct by earthly
motives. For, though we live an earthly life, we do not wage an earthly
war. The weapons for our warfare are not earthly, but, under God, are
powerful enough to pull down strongholds. We are engaged in confuting
arguments and pulling down every barrier raised against the knowledge of
God. We are taking captive every hostile thought, to bring it into
submission to the Christ, and are fully prepared to punish every act of
rebellion, when once your submission is complete. You look at the
outward appearance of things! Let anyone, who is confident that he
belongs to Christ, reflect, for himself, again on the fact -- that we
belong to Christ no less than he does. Even if I boast extravagantly
about our authority -- which the Lord gave us for building up your faith
and not for overthrowing it -- still I have no reason to be ashamed. I
say this so that it doesn't seem as if I am trying to overawe you by my
letters. For people say 'His letters are impressive and vigorous, but
his personal appearance is insignificant and his speaking contemptible.'
Let such a person be assured of this -- that our words in our letters
show us to be, when absent, just what our deeds will show us to be, when
present. We have not indeed the audacity to class or compare ourselves
with some of those who indulge in self-commendation! But, when such
persons measure themselves by themselves, and compare themselves with
themselves, they show a want of wisdom. We, however, will not give way
to unlimited boasting, but will confine ourselves to the limits of the
sphere to which God limited us, when he permitted us to come as far as
Corinth. For it is not the case, as it would be if we were not in the
habit of coming to you, that we are exceeding our bounds! Why, we were
the very first to reach you with the good news of the Christ! Our
boasting, therefore, is not unlimited, nor does it extend to the labours
of others; but our hope is that, as your faith grows, our influence
among you may be very greatly increased -- though still confined to our
sphere -- So that we will be able to tell the good news in the districts
beyond you, without trespassing on the sphere assigned to others, or
boasting of what has been already done. Let anyone who boasts make their
boast of the Lord. For it is not those who commend themselves that stand
the test, but those who are commended by the Lord.

     I could wish that you would tolerate a little folly in me! But
indeed you do tolerate me. I am jealous over you with the jealousy of
God. For I promised you in marriage as a pure bride, to one husband --
the Christ. Yet I fear that it may turn out that, just as the snake by
his craftiness deceived Eve, so your minds may have lost the loyalty and
purity due from you to the Christ. For, if some newcomer is proclaiming
a Jesus other than him whom we proclaimed, or if you are receiving a
Spirit different from the Spirit which you received, or a good news
different from that which you welcomed, then you are marvellously
tolerant! I do not regard myself as in any way inferior to the most
eminent apostles! Though I am no trained orator, yet I am not without
knowledge; indeed we made this perfectly clear to you in every way.
     Perhaps you say that I did wrong in humbling myself that you might
be exalted -- I mean because I told you God's good news without payment.
I robbed other churches by taking pay from them, so that I might serve
you! And, when I was with you in need, I did not become a burden to any
of you; for our friends, on coming from Macedonia, supplied my needs. I
kept myself, and will keep myself from being an expense to you in any
way. As surely as I know anything of the truth of Christ, this boast, as
far as I am concerned, will not be stopped in any part of Greece. Why?
Because I do not love you? God knows that I do!
     What I am doing now I will continue to do in order to cut away the
ground from under those who are wishing for some ground for attacking
me, so that as regards the thing of which they boast they may appear in
their true characters, just as we do. Such people are false apostles,
treacherous workers, disguising themselves as apostles of Christ! And no
wonder; for even Satan disguises himself as an angel of light. It is not
surprising, therefore, if his servants also disguise themselves as
servants of righteousness. But their end will be in accordance with
their actions.

     I say again -- Let no one think me a fool! Yet, if you do, at least
welcome me as you would a fool, so that I, too may indulge in a little
boasting. When I speak like this, I am not speaking as the Master would,
but as a fool might, in boasting so confidently. As so many are boasting
of earthly things, I, too, will boast. For all your cleverness, you
tolerate fools willingly enough! You tolerate a person even when they
enslave you, when they plunder you, when they get you into their power,
when they put on airs of superiority, when they strike you in the face!
I admit, to my shame, that we have been weak. But whatever the subject
on which others are not afraid to boast -- though it is foolish to say
so -- I am not afraid either! Are they Hebrews? So am I! Are they
Israelites? So am I! Are they descendants of Abraham? So am I! Are they
"Servants of Christ"? Though it is madness to talk like this, I am more
so than they! I have had more of toil, more of imprisonment! I have been
flogged times without number. I have been often at death's door. Five
times I received at the hands of my own people forty lashes, all but
one. Three times I was beaten with rods. Once I was stoned. Three times
I was shipwrecked. I have spent a whole day and night in the deep. My
journeys have been many. I have been through dangers from rivers,
dangers from robbers, dangers from my own people, dangers from the
Gentiles, dangers in towns, dangers in the country, dangers on the sea,
dangers among people pretending to be followers of the Lord. I have been
through toil and hardship. I have passed many a sleepless night; I have
endured hunger and thirst; I have often been without food; I have known
cold and nakedness. And, not to speak of other things, there is my daily
burden of anxiety about all the churches. Who is weak without my being
weak? Who is led astray without my burning with indignation? If I must
boast, I will boast of things which show my weakness! The God and Father
of the Lord Jesus -- he who is for ever blessed -- knows that I am
speaking the truth. When I was in Damascus, the Governor under King
Aretas had the gates of that city guarded, so as to arrest me, but I was
let down in a basket through a window in the wall, and so escaped his
hands.
     I must boast! It is unprofitable; but I will pass to visions and
revelations given by the Lord. I know a man in union with Christ, who,
fourteen years ago -- whether in the body or out of the body I do not
know; God knows -- was caught up (this man of whom I am speaking) to the
third heaven. And I know that this man -- whether in the body or
separated from the body I do not know; God knows -- Was caught up into
Paradise, and heard unspeakable things of which no human being may tell.
About such a man I will boast, but about myself I will not boast except
as regards my weaknesses. Yet if I choose to boast, I will not be a
fool; for I will be speaking no more than the truth. But I refrain, in
case anyone should credit me with more than he can see in me or hear
from me, and because of the marvellous character of the revelations. It
was for this reason, and to prevent my thinking too highly of myself,
that a thorn was sent to pierce my flesh -- an instrument of Satan to
discipline me -- so that I should not think too highly of myself. About
this I three times entreated the Lord, praying that it might leave me.
But his reply has been -- "My help is enough for you; for my strength
attains its perfection in the midst of weakness."
    Most gladly, then, will I boast all the more of my weaknesses, so
that the strength of the Christ may overshadow me. That is why I delight
in weakness, ill treatment, hardship, persecution, and difficulties,
when borne for Christ. For, when I am weak, then it is that I am strong!

*Conclusion*

     I have been 'playing the fool!' It is you who drove me to it. For
it is you who ought to have been commending me! Although I am nobody, in
no respect did I prove inferior to the most eminent apostles. The marks
of the true apostle were exhibited among you in constant endurance, as
well as by signs, by marvels, and by miracles. In what respect, I ask,
were you treated worse than the other churches, unless it was that, for
my part, I refused to become a burden to you? Forgive me the wrong I did
to you!
     Remember, this is the third time that I have made every preparation
to come to see you, and I will refuse to be a burden to you; I want, not
your money, but you. It is not the duty of children to put by for their
parents, but of parents to put by for their children. For my part, I
will most gladly spend, and be spent, for your welfare. Can it be that
the more intensely I love you the less I am to be loved? You will admit
that I was not a burden to you but you say that I was 'crafty' and
caught you 'by a trick'! Do you assert that I took advantage of you
through any of those whom I have sent to you? I urged Titus to go, and I
sent another follower with him. Did Titus take any advantage of you?
Didn't we live in the same Spirit, and tread in the same footsteps?
     Have you all this time been fancying that it is to you that we are
making our defence? No, it is in the sight of God, and in union with
Christ, that we are speaking. And all this, dear friends, is to build up
your characters; for I am afraid that perhaps, when I come, I may find
that you are not what I want you to be, and, on the other hand, that you
may find that I am what you do not want me to be. I am afraid that I may
find quarrelling, jealousy, ill feeling, rivalry, slandering,
backbiting, self-assertion, and disorder. I am afraid that, on my next
visit, my God may humble me in regard to you, and that I may have to
mourn over many who have long been sinning, and have not repented of the
impurity, immorality, and sensuality, in which they have indulged.
     For the third time I am coming to see you. By the word of two or
three witnesses each statement will be established. I have said it, and
I say it again before I come, just as if I were with you on my second
visit, though for the moment absent, I say to those who have been long
sinning, as well as to all others -- that if I come again, I will spare
no one. And that will be the proof, which you are looking for, that the
Christ speaks through me. There is no weakness in his dealings with you.
No, he shows his power among you. For though his crucifixion was due to
weakness, his life is due to the power of God. And we, also, are weak in
his weakness, but with him we will live for you through the power of
God. Put yourselves to the test, to see whether you are holding to the
faith. Examine yourselves. Surely you recognise this fact about
yourselves -- that Jesus Christ is in you! Unless indeed you cannot
stand the test! But I hope that you will recognise that we can stand the
test. We pray to God that you may do nothing wrong, not that we may be
seen to stand the test, but that you may do what is right, even though
we may seem not to stand the test. We have no power at all against the
truth, but we have power in the service of the truth. We are glad when
we are weak, if you are strong. And what we pray for is that you may
become perfect. This is my reason for writing as I am now doing, while I
am away from you, so that, when I am with you, I may not act harshly in
the exercise of the authority which the Lord gave me -- and gave me for
building up and not for pulling down.

     And now, friends, goodbye. Aim at perfection; take courage; agree
together; live in peace. And then God, the source of all love and peace,
will be with you. Greet one another with a sacred kiss. All Christ's
people here send you their greetings.

     May the blessing of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and
the communion with the Holy Spirit, be with you all.

                          PAUL'S LETTER TO THE
                               GALATIANS


*Introduction*

     To the churches in Galatia, from Paul, an apostle whose commission
is not from any human authority and is given, not by human beings, but
by Jesus Christ and God the Father who raised him from the dead; and
from all the followers of the Lord here. May God, our Father, and the
Lord Jesus Christ, bless you and give you peace. For Christ, to rescue
us from this present wicked age, gave himself for our sins, in
accordance with the will of our God and Father, to whom be ascribed all
glory for ever and ever. Amen.

     I am astonished at your so soon deserting him, who called you
through the love of Christ, for a different "good news," which is really
no good news at all. But then, I know that there are people who are
harassing you, and who want to pervert the good news of the Christ. Yet
even if we -- or if an angel from heaven were to tell you any other
"good news" than that which we told you, may he be accursed! We have
said it before, and I repeat it now -- If anyone tells you a "good news"
other than that which you received, may he be accursed!

     Is this, I ask, trying to conciliate people, or God? Am I seeking
to please people? If I were still trying to please people, I should not
be a servant of Christ.

*The Independence of the Apostle's Gospel*

     I remind you, friends, that the good news which I told is no mere
human invention. I, at least, did not receive it from any human being,
nor was I taught it, but it came to me through a revelation made by
Jesus Christ.
     You heard, no doubt, of my conduct when I was devoted to Judaism --
how I persecuted the church of God to an extent beyond belief, and tried
to destroy it, and how, in my devotion to Judaism, I surpassed many of
my contemporaries among my own people in my intense earnestness in
upholding the traditions of my ancestors. But when God, who had set me
apart even before my birth, and who called me by his love, saw fit to
reveal his Son in me, so that I might tell the good news of him among
the Gentiles, then at once, instead of consulting any human being, or
even going up to Jerusalem to see those who were apostles before me, I
went to Arabia, and came back again to Damascus. Three years afterwards
I went up to Jerusalem to make the acquaintance of Peter, and I stayed a
fortnight with him. I did not, however, see any other apostle, except
James, the Master's brother. (As to what I am now writing to you, I call
God to witness that I am speaking the truth). Afterwards I went to the
districts of Syria and Cilicia. But I was still unknown even by sight to
the Christian churches in Judea; all that they had heard was -- "The man
who once persecuted us is now telling the good news of the faith of
which he once tried to destroy." And they praised God for my sake.
     Fourteen years afterwards I went up to Jerusalem again with
Barnabas, and I took Titus also with me. It was in obedience to a
revelation that I went; and I laid before the apostles the good news
that I am proclaiming among the Gentiles. I did this privately before
those who are thought highly of because I was afraid that I might
possibly be taking, or might have already taken, a course which would
prove useless. Yet even my companion, Titus, though a Greek, was not
compelled to be circumcised. But, because of those who pretended to be
followers who had stolen in, the intruders who had crept in to spy on
the liberty which we have through union with Christ Jesus, in order to
bring us back to slavery -- Why, we did not for a moment yield
submission to them, so that the truth of the good news might be yours
always! Of those who are thought somewhat highly of -- what they once
were makes no difference to me; God does not recognise human
distinctions -- those, I say, who are thought highly of added nothing to
my message. On the contrary, they saw that I had been entrusted with the
good news for the Gentiles, just as Peter had been for the Jews. For he
who gave Peter power for his mission to the Jews gave me, also, power to
go to the Gentiles. Recognising the charge entrusted to me, James,
Peter, and John, who were regarded as pillars of the church, openly
acknowledged Barnabas and me as fellow workers, agreeing that we should
go to the Gentiles, and they to the Jews. Only we were to remember the
poor -- the thing I was myself anxious to do. But, when Peter came to
Antioch, I opposed him to his face; for he stood self-condemned. Before
certain persons came from James, he had been in the habit of eating with
the Gentile converts; but, when they came, he began to withdraw and hold
aloof, because he was afraid of offending those who still held to
circumcision. The rest of the Jewish converts were guilty of the same
hypocrisy, so that even Barnabas was led away by it. But, when I saw
that they were not dealing straightforwardly with the truth of the good
news, I said to Peter, before them all, 'If you, who were born a Jew,
adopt Gentile customs, instead of Jewish, why are you trying to compel
the Gentile converts to adopt Jewish customs?'

*The Law and the Gospel*

     We, though we are Jews by birth and not sinners of Gentile origin,
know that no one is pronounced righteous as the result of obedience to
Law, but only through faith in Christ Jesus. So we placed our faith in
Christ Jesus, in order that we might be pronounced righteous, as the
result of faith in Christ, and not of obedience to Law; for such
obedience will not result in even one soul's being pronounced righteous.
If, while seeking to be pronounced righteous through union with Christ,
we were ourselves seen to be sinners, would that make Christ an agent of
sin? Heaven forbid! For, if I rebuild the things that I pulled down, I
prove myself to have done wrong. I, indeed, through Law became dead to
Law, in order to live for God. I have been crucified with Christ. So it
is no longer I that live, but it is Christ who lives in me; and, as for
my present earthly life, I am living it by faith in the Son of God, who
loved me and gave himself for me. I do not reject the love of God. If
righteousness comes through Law, then there was no need for Christ to
die!

     Foolish Galatians! Who has been enchanting you -- you before whose
eyes Jesus Christ was depicted on the cross? Here is the one thing that
I want to find out from you -- Did you receive the Spirit as the result
of obedience to Law, or of your having listened with faith? Can you be
so foolish? After beginning with what is spiritual, do you now end with
what is external? Did you go through so much to no purpose? -- if indeed
it really was to no purpose! He who supplies you abundantly with his
Spirit and endows you with such powers -- does he do this as the result
of obedience to Law? Or as the result of your having listened with
faith? It is just as it was with Abraham --

     he had faith in God, and his faith was regarded by God as
righteousness.
 You see, then, that those whose lives are based on faith are the sons
of Abraham. And scripture, foreseeing that God would pronounce the
Gentiles righteous as the result of faith, foretold the good news to
Abraham in the words --

     "Through you all the Gentiles will be blessed."
 And, therefore, those whose lives are based on faith share the
blessings bestowed on the faith of Abraham. All who rely on obedience to
Law are under a curse, for scripture says --

     "Cursed is everyone who does not abide by all that is written in
the book of the Law, and do it."
 Again, it is evident that no one is pronounced righteous before God
through Law, for we read --

     "Through faith the righteous will find life."
 But the Law is not based on faith; no, its words are --

     "Those who practice these precepts will find life through them."
 Christ ransomed us from the curse pronounced in the Law, by taking the
curse on himself for us, for scripture says --

     "Cursed is anyone who is hanged on a tree."
 And this he did that the blessing given to Abraham might be extended to
the Gentiles through their union with Jesus Christ; that so, through our
faith, we also might receive the promised gift of the Spirit.
     To take an illustration, friends, from daily life -- No one sets
aside even an agreement between two people, when once it has been
confirmed, nor do they add conditions to it. Now it was to Abraham that
the promises were made, "and to his offspring." It was not said "to his
offsprings," as if many persons were meant, but the words were "to your
offspring," showing that one person was meant -- and that was Christ. My
point is this -- An agreement already confirmed by God cannot be
canceled by the Law, which came four hundred and thirty years later, so
as to cause the promise to be set aside. If our heritage is the result
of Law, then it has ceased to be the result of a promise. Yet God
conferred it on Abraham by a promise.
     What, then, you ask, was the use of the Law? It was a later
addition, to make people conscious of their wrongdoings, and intended to
last only until the coming of that offspring to whom the promise had
been made; and it was delivered through angels by a mediator. Now
mediation implies more than one person, but God is one only. Does that
set the Law in opposition to God's promises? Heaven forbid! For, if a
Law had been given capable of bestowing life, then righteousness would
have actually owed its existence to Law. But the words of scripture
represent the whole world as being in bondage to sin, so that the
promised blessing, dependent, as it is, on faith in Jesus Christ, may be
given to those who have faith in him.

     Before the coming of faith, we were kept under the guard of the
Law, in bondage, awaiting the faith that was destined to be revealed.
Thus the Law has proved a guide to lead us to Christ, in order that we
may be pronounced righteous as the result of faith. But now that faith
has come we no longer need a guide.
     For you are all sons of God, through your faith in Christ Jesus.
For all of you who were baptised into union with Christ clothed
yourselves with Christ. All distinctions between Jew and Greek, slave
and free, male and female, have vanished; for in union with Christ Jesus
you are all one. And, since you belong to Christ, it follows that you
are Abraham's offspring and, under the promise, sharers in the
inheritance.
     My point is this -- as long as the heir is under age, there is no
difference between him and a slave, though he is master of the whole
estate. He is subject to the control of guardians and stewards, during
the period for which his father has power to appoint them. And so is it
with us; when we were under age, as it were, we were slaves to the
puerile teaching of this world; but, when the full time came, God sent
his Son -- born a woman's child, born subject to Law -- to ransom those
who were subject to Law, so that we might take our position as sons.
     And it is because you are sons that God sent into our hearts the
Spirit of his Son, with the cry -- "Abba, our Father." You, therefore,
are no longer a slave, but a son; and, if a son, then an heir also, by
God's appointment.

     Yet formerly, in your ignorance of God, you became slaves to "gods"
which were no gods. But now that you have found God -- or, rather, have
been found by him -- how is it that you are turning back to that poor
and feeble puerile teaching, to which yet once again you are wanting to
become slaves? You are scrupulous in keeping days and months and seasons
and years! You make me fear that the labour which I have spent on you
may have been wasted.

     I entreat you, friends, to become like me, as I became like you.
You have never done me any wrong. You remember that it was owing to
bodily infirmity that on the first occasion I told you the good news.
And as for what must have tried you in my condition, it did not inspire
you with scorn or disgust, but you welcomed me as if I had been an angel
of God -- or Christ Jesus himself! What has become then, of your
blessings? For I can bear witness that, had it been possible, you would
have torn out your eyes and given them to me! Am I to think, then, that
I have become your enemy by telling you the truth? Certain people are
seeking your favour, but with no honourable object. No, indeed, they
want to isolate you, so that you will have to seek their favour. It is
always honourable to have your favour sought in an honourable cause, and
not only when I am with you, my dear children -- you for whom I am again
enduring a mother's pains, until a likeness to Christ will have been
formed in you. But I could wish to be with you now and speak in a
different tone, for I am perplexed about you.

     Tell me, you who want to be still subject to Law -- Why don't you
listen to the Law? Scripture says that Abraham had two sons, one the
child of the slave-woman and the other the child of the free woman. But
the child of the slave-woman was born in the course of nature, while the
child of the free woman was born in fulfilment of a promise. This story
may be taken as an allegory. The women stand for two covenants. One
covenant, given from Mount Sinai, produces a race of slaves and is
represented by Hagar. Hagar stands for Mount Sinai in Arabia, and
represents the Jerusalem of today, for she and her children are in
slavery. But the Jerusalem above is free, and she it is who is our
mother. For scripture says --

     "Rejoice, you barren one, who have never given birth,
     break into shouts, you who are never in labour,
         for many are the children of her who is desolate --
             yes, more than of her who has a husband."
 As for ourselves, friends, we, like Isaac, are children born in
fulfilment of a promise. Yet at that time the child born in the course
of nature persecuted the child born by the power of the Spirit; and it
is the same now. But what does the passage of scripture say?

     "Send away the slave-woman and her son; for the slave's son will
not be coheir with the son of the free woman."
 And so, friends, we are not children of a slave, but of her who is
free.

*The Gospel in the Daily Life*

     It is for freedom that Christ set us free; stand firm therefore,
and do not again be held under the yoke of slavery.
     Understand that I, Paul, myself tell you that if you allow
yourselves to be circumcised, Christ will avail you nothing. I again
declare to everyone who receives circumcision, that he binds himself to
obey the whole Law. You have severed yourselves from Christ -- you who
are seeking to be pronounced righteous through Law; you have fallen away
from love. For we, by the help of the Spirit, are eagerly waiting for
the fulfilment of our hope -- that we may be pronounced righteous as the
result of faith. If we are in union with Christ Jesus, neither is
circumcision nor the omission of it anything, but faith, working through
love, is everything. You were once making good progress! Who has
hindered you from obeying the truth? The persuasion brought to bear on
you does not come from him who calls you. A little yeast leavens all the
dough. I, through my union with the Lord, am persuaded that you will
learn to think with me. But the man who is disturbing your minds will
have to bear his punishment, whoever he may be. If I, friends, am still
proclaiming circumcision, why am I still persecuted? It seems that the
cross has ceased to be an obstacle! I could even wish that the people
who are unsettling you would go further still and mutilate themselves.

     Remember, friends, to you the call came to give you freedom. Only,
do not make your freedom an opportunity for self-indulgence but serve
one another in a loving spirit. Indeed, the whole Law has been summed up
in this one precept --

     "You must love your neighbour as you love yourself."
 But, if you are continually wounding and preying on one another, take
care that you are not destroyed by one another.
     This is what I have to say -- Let your steps be guided by the
Spirit, and then you will never gratify the cravings of your earthly
nature. For these cravings of our earthly nature conflict with the
Spirit, and the Spirit with our earthly nature -- they are two contrary
principles -- so that you cannot do what you wish. But, if you follow
the guidance of the Spirit, you are not subject to Law. The sins of our
earthly nature are unmistakable. They are sins like these -- sexual
immorality, impurity, indecency, idolatry, sorcery, quarrels, strife,
jealousy, outbursts of passion, rivalries, dissensions, divisions,
feelings of envy, drunkenness, revelry, and the like. And I warn you, as
I warned you before, that those who indulge in such things will have no
place in the kingdom of God. But the fruit produced by the Spirit is
love, joy, peace, forbearance, kindliness, generosity, trustfulness,
gentleness, self-control. Against such things there is no law! And those
who belong to Jesus, the Christ, have already crucified their earthly
nature, with its passions and its cravings.
     Since our life is due to the Spirit, let us rule our conduct also
by the Spirit. Do not let us grow vain, and provoke or envy one another.
My friends, even if someone should be caught committing a sin, you who
are spiritually minded should, in a gentle spirit, help them to recover
themselves, taking care that you yourselves are not tempted. Bear one
another's burdens, and so carry out the Law of the Christ. If a person
imagines themselves to be somebody, when they are really nobody, they
deceive themselves. Let everyone test their own work, and then their
cause for satisfaction will be in themselves and not in a comparison
with their neighbour; for everyone must bear their own load. The person,
however, who is being instructed in the message ought always to share
their blessings with their teacher.
     Do not be deceived. God cannot be mocked. What a person sows that
they will reap. For the person who sows the field of their earthly
nature will from that earthly nature reap corruption; while the one who
sows the field of the spirit will from that spirit reap eternal life.
Let us never tire of doing right, for at the proper season we will reap
our harvest, if we do not grow weary. Therefore, I say, as the
opportunity occurs, let us treat everyone with kindness, and especially
members of the household of the faith.

*Conclusion in the Apostle's own handwriting*

     See in what large letters I am writing with my own hand. The people
who are trying to compel you to be circumcised are the people who wish
to appear to advantage in regard to outward observances. They do it only
to avoid being persecuted for the cross of Jesus, the Christ Even these
men who are circumcised do not themselves keep the Law; yet they want
you to be circumcised, so that they may boast of your observance of the
rite. But, for my part, may I never boast of anything except the cross
of Jesus Christ, our Master, through whom the world has been crucified
to me, and I to the world. For neither is circumcision nor the omission
of it anything; but a new nature is everything. May all who rule their
conduct by this principle find peace and mercy -- they who are the
Israel of God.

     For the future let no one trouble me; for I bear the marks of Jesus
branded on my body.

     May the blessing of Jesus Christ, our Lord, rest on your souls,
friends. Amen.

                          PAUL'S LETTER TO THE
                               EPHESIANS


*Introduction*

     To Christ's people at Ephesus who are faithful to him, from Paul,
an apostle of Christ Jesus, by the will of God. May God, our Father, and
the Lord Jesus Christ bless you and give you peace.

     Blessed is the God and Father of Jesus Christ, our Lord, who has
blessed us on high with every spiritual blessing, in Christ. For he
chose us in our union with Christ before the creation of the universe,
so that we might be holy and blameless in his sight, living in the
spirit of love. From the first he destined us, in his goodwill towards
us, to be adopted as sons through Jesus Christ, and so to enhance that
glorious manifestation of his loving kindness which he gave us in the
one he loves; for in him, and through the shedding of his blood, we have
found redemption in the pardon of our offences. All this accords with
the loving kindness which God lavished on us, accompanied by countless
gifts of wisdom and discernment, when he made known to us his hidden
purpose. And it also accords with the goodwill which God purposed to
exhibit in Christ, in view of that divine order which was to mark the
completion of the ages, when he should make everything, both in heaven
and on earth, centre in him. In him, I say, for by our union with him we
became God's heritage, having from the first been destined for this in
the intention of him who, in all that happens, is carrying out his own
fixed purpose; that we should enhance his glory -- we who have been the
first to rest our hopes on the Christ. And you, too, by your union with
him, after you had heard the message of the truth, the good news of your
salvation -- you believed in him and were sealed as his by receiving the
holy Spirit, which he had promised. And the Spirit is a pledge of our
future heritage, foreshadowing the full redemption of God's own people
-- to enhance his glory.

*The power of God displayed in Christ, the Head of the Church*

     And therefore I, ever since I heard of the faith in the Lord Jesus
which prevails among you, and of your confidence in all Christ's people,
have never omitted to thank God on your behalf, whenever I make mention
of you in my prayers. My prayer is that the God of Jesus Christ our
Lord, the all-glorious Father, may inspire you with wisdom and true
insight through a fuller knowledge of himself; that your minds may be so
enlightened that you may realise the hope given by God's call, the
wealth of the glory of his heritage among Christ's people, and the
transcendent greatness of the power which he is able to exercise in
dealing with us who believe in him. The same mighty power was exerted on
the Christ, when he raised the Christ from the dead and "caused him to
sit at his right hand" on high, exalting him above all angels and
archangels of every rank, and above every name that can be named,
whether in the present age, or in the age to come. And God placed all
things under Christ's feet, and gave him to the church as its supreme
head; for the church is Christ's body, and is filled by him who fills
all things everywhere with his presence.  You yourselves were once dead
because of your offences and sins. For at one time you lived in sin,
following the ways of the world, in subjection to the Ruler of the
powers of the air -- the Spirit who is still at work among the
disobedient. And it was among them that we all once lived our lives,
indulging the cravings of our earthly nature, and carrying out the
desires prompted by that earthly nature and by our own thoughts. Our
nature exposed us to the divine wrath, like the rest of humanity. Yet
God, in his abundant compassion, and because of the great love with
which he loved us, even though we were dead because of our offences,
gave life to us in giving life to the Christ. (By God's loving kindness
you have been saved.) And, through our union with Christ Jesus, God
raised us with him, and caused us to sit with him on high, in order
that, by his goodness to us in Christ Jesus, he might display in the
ages to come the boundless wealth of his loving kindness. For it is by
God's loving kindness that you have been saved, through your faith. It
is not due to yourselves; the gift is God's. It is not due to obedience
to Law, so that no one can boast. For we are God's handiwork, created,
by our union with Christ Jesus, for the good actions in doing which God
had pre-arranged that we should spend our lives.
     Remember, therefore, that you were once Gentiles yourselves, as
your bodies showed; you were called "the Uncircumcised" by those who
were called "the Circumcised" -- circumcised only by human hands!
Remember that you were at that time far from Christ; you were shut out
from the citizenship of Israel; you were strangers to the covenants
founded on God's promise; you were in the world without hope and without
God. But now, through your union with Christ Jesus, you who once were
far off have, by the shedding of the blood of the Christ, been brought
near. He it is who is our peace. He made the two divisions of humanity
one, broke down the barrier that separated them, and in his human nature
put an end to the cause of enmity between them -- the Law with its
injunctions and ordinances -- in order to create, through union with
himself, from Jew and Gentile, one new humanity and so make peace. And
when, on the cross, he had destroyed their mutual enmity, he sought by
means of his cross to reconcile them both to God, united in one body. He
came with the good news of peace for you who were far off, and of peace
for those who were near; for it is through him that we, the Jews and the
Gentiles, united in the one Spirit, are now able to approach the Father.
It follows, then, that you are no longer strangers and foreigners, but
are fellow citizens with Christ's people and members of God's household.
You have been built up on the foundation laid by the apostles and
prophets, Christ Jesus himself being the cornerstone. United in him,
every part of the building, closely joined together, will grow into a
temple, consecrated by its union with the Lord. And, through union in
him, you also are being built up together, to be a place where God lives
through the Spirit.

*The Apostle's Divine Commission to the Gentiles*

     For this reason I, Paul, the prisoner of Jesus, the Christ, for the
sake of you Gentiles -- For you have heard, I suppose, of the
responsible charge with which God entrusted me for your benefit, and
also that it was by direct revelation that the hidden purpose of God was
made known to me, as I have already briefly told you. And, by reading
what I have written, you will be able to judge how far I understand this
hidden purpose of God in Christ. In former generations it was not made
known to humanity, as fully as it has now been revealed by the Spirit to
the apostles and prophets among Christ's people -- That, by union with
Christ Jesus and through the good news, the Gentiles are coheirs with us
and members of one body, and that they share with us in God's Promise.
Of this good news I become an assistant, in virtue of the charge with
which God entrusted me in the exercise of his power -- Yes, to me, who
am less than the least of all Christ's people, was this charge
entrusted! -- to tell the Gentiles the good news of the boundless wealth
to be found in the Christ, and to make clear what is God's way of
working out that hidden purpose which from the first has been concealed
in the mind of the Creator of all things; so that now to the archangels
and to all the powers on high should be made known, through the church,
the all-embracing wisdom of God, in accordance with that purpose which
runs through all the ages and which he has now accomplished in Jesus,
the Christ, our Master. And in union with him, and through our trust in
him, we find courage to approach God with confidence. Therefore I beg
you not to be disheartened at the sufferings that I am undergoing for
your sakes; for they redound to your honour. For this reason, then, I
kneel before the Father -- from whom all "fatherhood" in heaven and on
earth derives its name -- and pray that, in proportion to the wealth of
his glory, he will strengthen you with his power by breathing his Spirit
into your inmost soul, so that the Christ, through your faith, may make
his home within your hearts in love; and I pray that you, now firmly
rooted and established, may, with all Christ's people, have the power to
comprehend in all its width and length and height and depth, and to
understand -- though it surpasses all understanding -- the love of the
Christ; and so be filled with all the fullness of God.

     To him who, through his power which is at work within us, is able
to do far more than anything that we can ask or conceive -- to him be
all glory through the church and through Christ Jesus, for all
generations, age after age. Amen.

*The Gospel and Daily Life*

     I beg you, then -- I who am a prisoner in the Master's cause -- to
live lives worthy of the call that you have received; always humble and
gentle, patient, bearing lovingly with one another, and striving to
maintain in the bond of peace the unity given by the Spirit. There is
but one body and one Spirit, just as there was but one hope set before
you when you received your call. There is but one Lord, one faith, one
baptism. There is but one God and Father of all -- the God who is over
all, pervades all, and is in all. Everyone of us, however, has been
entrusted with some charge, each in accordance with the extent of the
gift of the Christ. That is why it is said --

     "When he went up on high, he led his captives into captivity. And
gave gifts to humanity."
 Now surely this "going up" must imply that he had already gone down
into the world beneath. He who went down is the same as he who went up
-- up beyond the highest heaven, so that he might fill all things with
his presence. And he it is who gave to the church apostles, prophets,
missionaries, pastors, and teachers, to fit his people for the work of
the ministry, for the building up of the body of the Christ. And this
will continue, until we all attain to that unity which is given by faith
and by a fuller knowledge of the Son of God; until we reach maturity --
the full standard of the perfection of the Christ. Then we will no
longer be like infants, tossed backward and forward, blown about by
every breath of human teaching and by people's trickery and craftiness;
but holding the truth in a spirit of love, we will grow into complete
union with him who is our head -- Christ himself. For from him the whole
body, closely joined and knit together by the contact of every part with
the source of its life, derives its power to grow, in proportion to the
vigour of each individual part; and so is being built up in a spirit of
love.

     This, then, as one in union with the Lord, I implore: Do not
continue to live such purposeless lives as the Gentiles live, with their
powers of discernment darkened, cut off from the life of God, owing to
the ignorance that prevails among them and to the hardness of their
hearts. Lost to all sense of shame, they have abandoned themselves to
licentiousness, in order to practice every kind of impurity without
restraint. But far different is the lesson you learned from the Christ
-- if, that is, you really listened to him, and through union with him
were taught the truth, as it is to be found in Jesus. For you learned
with regard to your former way of living that you must cast off your old
nature, which, yielding to deluding passions, grows corrupt; that the
spirit of your minds must be constantly renewed; and that you must
clothe yourselves in that new nature which was created to resemble God,
with the righteousness and holiness springing from the truth.
     Since, therefore, you have cast off what is false, you must every
one of you speak the truth to your neighbours. For we are united to one
another like the parts of a body. Be angry, yet do not sin. Do not let
the sun go down on your anger; and give no opportunity to the devil. Let
the person who steals steal no longer, but rather they should toil with
their hands at honest work, so that they may have something to share
with anyone in need. Never let any foul word pass your lips, but only
such good words as the occasion demands, so that they may be a help to
those who hear them. And do not grieve God's Holy Spirit; for it was
through that Spirit that God sealed you as his, against the day of
redemption. Let all bitterness, passion, anger, brawling, and abusive
language be banished from among you, as well as all malice. Be kind to
one another, tenderhearted, ready to forgive one another, just as God,
in Christ, forgave you.  Therefore imitate God, as his dear children,
and live a life of love, following the example of the Christ, who loved
you and gave himself for you as an offering and a sacrifice to God, that
should be fragrant and acceptable.
     As for sexual immorality and every kind of impurity, or greed, do
not let them even be mentioned among you, as befits Christ's people, nor
shameful conduct, nor foolish talk or jesting, for they are wholly out
of place among you; but rather thanksgiving. For of this you may be sure
-- that no one who is unchaste or impure or greedy of gain (for to be
greedy of gain is idolatry) has any place awaiting him in the kingdom of
the Christ and God.
     Do not let anyone deceive you with specious arguments. Those are
the sins that bring down the wrath of God on the disobedient. Therefore
have nothing to do with such people. For, although you were once in
darkness, now, by your union with the Lord, you are in the light. Live
as children of light -- for the outcome of life in the light may be seen
in every form of goodness, righteousness, and sincerity -- always trying
to find out what is pleasing to the Lord. Take no part in deeds of
darkness, from which no good can come; on the contrary, expose them. It
is degrading even to speak of the things continually done by them in
secret. All such actions, when exposed, have their true character made
manifest by the light. For everything that has its true character made
manifest is clear as light. And that is why it is said --

     "Sleeper, awake!
     Arise from the dead,
         and the Christ will give you light!"
 Take great care, then, how you live -- not unwisely but wisely, making
the most of every opportunity; for these are evil days. Therefore do not
grow thoughtless, but try to understand what the Lord's will is. Do not
drink wine to excess, for that leads to profligacy; but seek to be
filled with the Spirit of God, and speak to one another in psalms and
hymns and sacred songs. Sing and make music in your hearts to the Lord.
Always give thanks for everything to our God and Father, in the name of
our Lord Jesus Christ.
     Submit to one another because you honour and respect Christ.
     Wives should submit to their husbands as submitting to the Lord.
For a man is the head of his wife, as the Christ is the head of the
church -- being indeed himself the Saviour of his body. But as the
church submits to the Christ, so also should wives submit to their
husbands in everything. Husbands, love your wives, just as the Christ
loved the church, and gave himself for her, to make her holy, after
purifying her by the washing with the water, according to his promise;
so that he might himself bring the church, in all her beauty, into his
own presence, with no spot or wrinkle or blemish of any kind, but that
she might be holy and faultless. That is how husbands ought to love
their wives -- as if they were their own bodies. A man who loves his
wife is really loving himself; for no one ever yet hated his own body.
But everyone feeds his body and cares for it, just as the Christ for the
church; for we are members of his body.

     For this cause a man will leave his father and mother, and be
united to his wife; and the man and his wife will become one.
 In this there is a profound truth -- I am speaking of Christ and his
church. However, for you individually, let each love his wife as if she
were himself; and the wife be careful to respect her husband.
     Children, obey your parents, as children of the Lord; for that is
but right. "Honour your father and mother" -- this is the first
Commandment with a promise -- "so that you may prosper and have a long
life on earth." And fathers, do not irritate your children, but bring
them up with Christian discipline and instruction.
     Slaves, obey your earthly masters, with anxious care, giving them
ungrudging service, as if obeying the Christ; not only when their eyes
are on you, as if you had merely to please people, but as slaves of
Christ, who are trying to carry out the will of God. Give your service
heartily and cheerfully, as working for the Master and not for people;
for you know that everyone will be rewarded by the Master for any honest
work that he has done, whether he is a slave or free. And masters, treat
your slaves in the same spirit. Give up threatening them; for you know
that he who is both their Master and yours is in heaven, and that before
him there is no distinction of rank.
     For the future, find strength in your union with the Lord, and in
the power which comes from his might. Put on the full armour of God, so
that you may be able to stand your ground against the stratagems of the
devil. For ours is no struggle against enemies of flesh and blood, but
against all the various powers of evil that hold sway in the darkness
around us, against the spirits of wickedness on high. Therefore take up
the full armour of God, so that when the evil day comes, you may be able
to withstand the attack, and, having fought to the end, still to stand
your ground. Stand your ground, then, with truth for your belt, and with
righteousness for your breastplate, and with the readiness to serve the
good news of peace as shoes for your feet. At every onslaught take up
faith for your shield; for with it you will be able to extinguish all
the flaming darts of the evil one. And receive the helmet of salvation,
and the sword of the Spirit -- which is the message of God -- always
with prayer and supplication. Pray in spirit at all times. Be intent on
this, with unwearying perseverance and supplication for all Christ's
people -- and on my behalf also, so that when I begin to speak, words
may be given me, so that I may fearlessly make known the inmost truth of
the good news, on behalf of which I am an ambassador -- in chains! Pray
that, in telling it, I may speak fearlessly as I ought.

*Conclusion*

     To enable you, as well as others, to know all that concerns me and
what I am doing, Tychicus, our dear friend and faithful helper in the
Master's cause, will tell you everything. I am sending him to you on
purpose that you may learn all about us, and that he may cheer your
hearts.

     May God, the Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ give every follower
peace, and love linked with faith. May God's blessing be with all who
love our Lord Jesus Christ with an undying love.

                          PAUL'S LETTER TO THE
                              PHILIPPIANS
  To all Christ's people at Philippi, with the supervisors and
assistants, from Paul and Timothy, servants of Christ Jesus. May God,
our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ bless you, and give you peace.
Every recollection that I have of you is a cause of thanksgiving to God,
always, in every prayer that I offer for you all -- my prayers are full
of joy -- because of the share that you have had in spreading the good
news, from the first day that you received it until now. For of this I
am confident, that he who began a good work in you will complete it in
readiness for the day of Jesus Christ. And, indeed, I am justified in
feeling like this about you all; because you have a warm place in my
heart -- you who all, both in my imprisonment and in the work of
defending and establishing the good news, shared my privilege with me.
God will bear me witness how I yearn for you all with the tenderness of
Christ Jesus. And what I pray for is this -- that your love may grow yet
stronger and stronger, with increasing knowledge and all discernment,
until you are able to appreciate all moral distinctions. And I pray,
too, that you may be kept pure and blameless against the day of Christ,
bearing a rich harvest of that righteousness which comes through Jesus
Christ, to the glory and praise of God.
     Friends, I want you to realise that what has happened to me has
actually served to forward the good news. It has even become evident,
not only to all the imperial guard, but to everyone else, that it is for
Christ's sake that I am in chains. And besides this, most of our fellow
followers have gained confidence in the Lord through my chains, and now
venture with far greater freedom to speak of God's message fearlessly.
It is true that some do proclaim the Christ out of jealousy and
opposition, but there are others who proclaim him from goodwill. The
latter do it from love for me, knowing that I have been appointed to
plead the cause of the good news. The former spread the news of the
Christ in a factious spirit, and not sincerely, thinking to add to the
pain of my chains. But what of that? Only that in some way or other,
either with assumed or with real earnestness, Christ is being made
known; and at that I rejoice. Yes, and I will rejoice, for I know that,
through your prayers and through a rich supply of the Spirit of Jesus
Christ, all this will make for my salvation. And this will fulfil my
earnest expectation and hope that I will have no cause for shame, but
that, with unfailing courage, now as before, Christ will be honoured in
my body, whether by my life or by my death, for to me life is Christ,
and death is gain. But what if the life here in the body -- if this
brings me fruit from my labours? Then which to choose I cannot tell! I
am sorely perplexed either way! My own desire is to depart and be with
Christ, for this would be far better. But, for your sakes, it may be
more needful that I should still remain here in the body. Yes, I am
confident that this is so, and therefore I am sure that I will stay, and
stay near you all, to promote your progress and joy in the faith; so
that, when you once more have me among you, you, in your union with
Christ Jesus, may find in me fresh cause for exultation. Under all
circumstances let your lives be worthy of the good news of the Christ:
so that, whether I come and see you, or whether I hear of your affairs
at a distance, I may know that you are standing firm, animated by one
spirit, and joining with one heart in a common struggle for the faith
taught by the good news, without ever shrinking from your opponents. To
them this will be a sign of their destruction and of your salvation -- a
sign from God. For, on behalf of Christ, you have had the privilege
granted you, not only of trusting in him, but also of suffering on his
behalf. You will be engaged in the same hard struggle as that which you
once saw me waging, and which you hear that I am waging still.
     If, then, any encouragement comes through union with Christ, if
there is any persuasive power in love, if there is any communion with
the Spirit, if there is any tenderness or pity, I entreat you to make my
happiness complete -- live together animated by the same spirit and in
mutual love, one in heart, animated by one Spirit. Nothing should be
done out of selfish ambition or vain conceit. Rather, in humility lift
others up above yourselves, considering not only your own interests but
also the interests of others. Let the spirit of Christ Jesus be yours
also. Though the divine nature was his from the beginning, yet he did
not look on equality with God as above all things to be clung to, but
impoverished himself by taking the nature of a servant and becoming like
one of us; he appeared among us as a man, and still further humbled
himself by submitting even to death -- to death on a cross! And that is
why God raised him to the very highest place, and gave him the name
which stands above all other names, so that in adoration of the name of
Jesus every knee should bend, in heaven, on earth, and under the earth,
and that every tongue should acknowledge JESUS CHRIST as LORD -- to the
glory of God the Father. Therefore, my dear friends, as you have always
been obedient in the past, so now work out your own salvation with
anxious care, not only when I am with you, but all the more now that I
am absent. Remember it is God who, in his kindness, is at work within
you, enabling you both to will and to work. In all that you do, avoid
murmuring and dissension, so as to prove yourselves blameless and
innocent -- faultless children of God, in the midst of an evil-disposed
and perverse generation, in which you are seen shining like stars in a
dark world, offering to them the message of life; and then I will be
able at the day of Christ to boast that I did not run my course for
nothing, or toil for nothing. And yet, even if, when your faith is
offered as a sacrifice to God, my lifeblood must be poured out in
addition, still I will rejoice and share the joy of you all; and you
must also rejoice and share my joy. I hope, however, as one who trusts
in the Lord Jesus, to send Timothy to you before long, so that I may
myself be cheered by receiving news of you. For I have no one but him to
send -- no one of kindred spirit who would take the same genuine
interest in your welfare. They are all pursuing their own aims and not
those of Christ Jesus. But you know what Timothy has proved himself to
be, and how, like a child working for his father, he worked hard with me
in spreading the good news. It is Timothy, then, whom I hope to send,
just as soon as I find out what is going to happen to me here. And I am
confident, as one who trusts in the Lord Jesus, that before long I
myself will follow. Still I think it necessary to send Epaphroditus to
you now, for he is my dear friend, fellow worker, and fellow soldier,
and he was also your messenger to help me in my need. For he has been
longing to see you all, and has been distressed because you heard of his
illness. And I can assure you that his illness very nearly proved fatal.
But God had pity on him, and not on him only but also on me, so that I
might not have sorrow on sorrow. I am all the more ready, therefore, to
send him, so that the sight of him may revive your spirits and my own
sorrow be lightened. Give him, then, the heartiest of Christian
welcomes, and hold such people in great honour. For it was owing to his
devotion to the Master's work that he was at the point of death, having
risked his own life in the effort to supply what was wanting in the help
that you sent me.
     In conclusion, my friends, may all joy be yours in your union with
the Lord. To repeat what I have already written does not weary me, and
is the safe course for you. Beware of those dogs! Beware of those
mischievous workers! Beware of the men who mutilate themselves! For it
is we who are the circumcised -- we whose worship is prompted by the
Spirit of God, who exult in Christ Jesus, and who do not rely on
external privileges; though I, if anyone, have cause to rely even on
them. If anyone thinks he can rely on external privileges, far more can
I! I was circumcised when eight days old; I am an Israelite by birth,
and of the tribe of Benjamin; I am a Hebrew, and the child of Hebrews.
As to the Law, I was a Pharisee; as to zeal, I was a persecutor of the
church; as to such righteousness as is due to Law, I proved myself
blameless. But all the things which I once held to be gains I have now,
for the Christ's sake, come to count as loss. More than that, I count
everything as loss, for the sake of the exceeding value of the knowledge
of Christ Jesus my Lord. And for his sake I have lost everything, and
count it as rubbish, if I may but gain Christ and be found in union with
him; any righteousness that I have being, not the righteousness that
results from Law, but the righteousness which comes through faith in
Christ -- the righteousness which is derived from God and is founded on
faith. Then indeed I will know Christ, and the power of his
resurrection, and all that it means to share his sufferings, in the hope
that, if I become like him in death, I may possibly attain to the
resurrection from the dead. Not that I have already laid hold of it, or
that I am already made perfect. But I press on, in the hope of actually
laying hold of that for which indeed I was laid hold of by Christ Jesus.
For I, friends, do not regard myself as having yet laid hold of it. But
this one thing I do -- forgetting what lies behind, and straining every
nerve for that which lies in front, I press on to the goal, to gain the
prize of that heavenward call which God gave me through Christ Jesus.
Let all of us, then, whose faith is mature, think this way. Then, if on
any matter you think otherwise, God will make that also plain to you.
Only we are bound to order our lives by what we have already attained.
     My friends, unite in following my example, and fix your eyes on
those who are living by the pattern which we have set you. For there are
many -- of whom I have often told you, and now tell you even with tears
-- who are living in enmity to the cross of the Christ. The end of such
people is ruin; for their appetites are their God, and they glory in
their shame; their minds are given up to earthly things. But we are
citizens of heaven, and from heaven we expect a saviour to come, the
Lord Jesus Christ. By the exercise of his power to bring everything into
subjection to himself, he will make our humble bodies like his glorious
body.
     So then, my dear friends, whom I am longing to see -- you who are
my joy and my crown, stand fast in union with the Lord, dear friends. I
entreat Euodia, and I entreat Syntyche, to live in harmony, in union
with the Lord; yes, and I ask you, my true comrade, to help them,
remembering that they toiled by my side in spreading the good news; and
so, too, did Clement and my other fellow workers, whose names are in the
book of life. All joy be yours at all times in your union with the Lord.
Again I repeat -- All joy be yours. Let your forbearing spirit be plain
to everyone. The Lord is near. Do not be anxious about anything; but
under all circumstances, by prayer and entreaty joined with
thanksgiving, make your needs known to God. Then the peace of God, which
is beyond all human understanding, will stand guard over your hearts and
thoughts, through your union with Christ Jesus.
     In conclusion, friends, whenever you find things that are true or
honourable, righteous or pure, loveable or praiseworthy, or if virtue
and honour have any meaning, let them fill your thoughts. All that you
learned and received and heard and saw in me put into practice
continually; and then God, the giver of peace, will be with you. It was
a matter of great joy to me, as one in union with the Lord, that at
length your interest in me had revived. The interest indeed you had, but
not the opportunity. Do not think that I am saying this under the
pressure of want. For I, however I am placed, have learned to be
independent of circumstances. I know how to face humble circumstances,
and I know how to face prosperity. Into all and every human experience I
have been initiated -- into plenty and hunger, into prosperity and want.
I can do everything through the strength of the one who makes me strong!
Yet you have acted nobly in sharing my troubles. And you at Philippi
know, as well as I, that in the early days of the good news -- at the
time when I had just left Macedonia -- no church, with the one exception
of yourselves, had anything to do with me as far as giving and receiving
are concerned. Indeed, even while I was still in Thessalonica, you sent
more than once to relieve my wants. It is not that I am anxious for your
gifts, but I am anxious to see the abundant return that will be placed
to your account. I have enough of everything, and to spare. My wants are
fully satisfied, now that I have received from Epaphroditus the gifts
which you sent me -- the sweet fragrance of a sacrifice acceptable and
pleasing to God. And my God, out of the greatness of his wealth, will,
in glory, fully satisfy your every need, through your union with Christ
Jesus. To him, our God and Father, be ascribed all glory for every and
ever. Amen. Give my greeting to everyone of the people of Christ Jesus.
The Lord's followers who are with me send your their greetings. All
Christ's people here, and especially those who belong to the Emperor's
household, send theirs.

     May the blessing of the Lord Jesus Christ rest on your souls.

                          PAUL'S LETTER TO THE
                               COLOSSIANS


*Introduction*

     From Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus, by the will of God, and from
Timothy, also a follower of the Lord. To Christ's people at Colossae --
the followers who are faithful to him: May God, our Father, bless you
and give you peace.

     Whenever we pray we never fail to thank God, the Father of our Lord
Jesus Christ, for you, now that we have heard of your faith in Christ
Jesus and of the love that you have for all his people, because of the
hope which is kept safe for you in heaven. Of this hope you heard long
ago in the true message of the good news which reached you, bearing
fruit and growing, as it does, through all the world, just as it did
among you from the very day that you heard of God's loving kindness, and
understood what that loving kindness really is. It is just what you
learned from Epaphras, our dear fellow servant, who, as a minister of
the Christ, faithfully represents us, and who told us of the love with
which the Spirit has inspired you.
     And therefore we, from the very day that we heard this, have never
ceased praying for you, or asking that you may be filled with the
knowledge of the will of God, which comes through all true spiritual
wisdom and insight. Then you will live lives worthy of the Master, and
so please God in every way. Your lives will be fruitful in every kind of
good action, and grow into a fuller knowledge of God; you will be made
strong at all points with a strength worthy of the power manifested in
his glory -- strong to endure with patience, and even with gladness,
whatever may happen to you; and you will give thanks to the Father who
made you fit to share the lot which awaits Christ's people in the realms
of light.

*The Person and Work of the Christ*

     For God has rescued us from the tyranny of darkness, and has
removed us into the kingdom of his Son, who is the embodiment of his
love, and through whom we have found deliverance in the forgiveness of
our sins.
     For Christ is the incarnation of the invisible God -- firstborn and
head of all creation; for in him was created all that is in heaven and
on earth, the visible and the invisible -- angels and archangels and all
the powers of heaven. All has been created through him and for him. He
was before all things, and all things unite in him; and he is the head
of the church, which is his body. The firstborn from the dead, he is to
the church the source of its life, that he, in all things, may stand
first. For it pleased the Father that in him the divine nature in all
its fulness should live, and through him to reconcile all things to
himself (making peace by the shedding of Christ's blood offered on the
cross) -- whether on earth or in heaven. And it pleased God that you,
once estranged from him and hostile towards him in your thoughts, intent
only on wickedness -- but now he has reconciled you to himself by the
sacrifice of Christ's earthly body in death -- it has pleased God that
you should stand in his presence holy, pure, and blameless, if only you
remain true to your faith, firm and immovable, never abandoning the hope
held out in the good news to which you listened, which has been
proclaimed among all created things under heaven, and of which I, Paul,
was made an assistant.

     Now at last I can rejoice in my sufferings on your behalf, and in
my own person I supplement the afflictions endured by the Christ, for
the sake of his body, the church; of which I myself became a minister in
virtue of the office with which God entrusted me for your benefit, to
declare the message of God in all its fulness -- that truth which has
been hidden from former ages and generations. But now it has been
revealed to God's people, to whom it was his pleasure to make known the
surpassing glory of that hidden truth when proclaimed among the Gentiles
-- "Christ among you! Your hope of glory!" This is the Christ whom we
proclaim, warning everyone, and instructing everyone, with all the
wisdom that we possess, in the hope of bringing everyone into God's
presence perfected by union with Christ. It is for that I toil,
struggling with all the energy which he inspires and which works
powerfully within me.  I want you to know in how great a struggle I am
engaged for you and for Christ's people at Laodicea, and for all who
have not yet seen me; in the hope that they, being bound to one another
by love, and keeping in view the full blessedness of a firm conviction,
may be encouraged to strive for a perfect knowledge of God's hidden
truth, even Christ himself, in whom all treasures of wisdom and
knowledge lie hidden. I say this to prevent anyone from deceiving you by
plausible arguments. It is true that I am not with you in person, but I
am with you in spirit, and am glad to see the good order and the
unbroken front resulting from your faith in Christ.

     Since, therefore, you have received Jesus, the Christ, as your
Lord, live your lives in union with him -- rooted in him, building up
your characters through union with him, growing stronger through your
faith, as you were taught, overflowing with faith and thanksgiving. Take
care that there is not someone who will carry you away by his
"philosophy" -- a hollow sham! -- following, as it does, mere human
traditions, and dealing with puerile questions of this world, and not
with Christ. For in Christ the Godhead in all its fulness dwells
incarnate; and, by your union with him, you also are filled with it. He
is the head of all archangels and powers of heaven. By your union with
him you received a circumcision that was not performed by human hands,
when you threw off the tyranny of the earthly body, and received the
circumcision of the Christ. For in baptism you were buried with Christ;
and in baptism you were also raised to life with him, through your faith
in the omnipotence of God, who raised him from the dead. And to you, who
once were dead, by reason of your sins and your uncircumcised nature --
to you God gave life in giving life to Christ! He pardoned all our sins!
He canceled the bond which stood against us -- the bond that consisted
of ordinances -- and which was directly hostile to us! He has taken it
out of our way by nailing it to the cross! He rid himself of all the
powers of evil, and held them up to open contempt, when he celebrated
his triumph over them on the cross!
     Do not, then, allow anyone to take you to task on questions of
eating or drinking, or in the matter of annual or monthly or weekly
festivals. These things are only the shadow of what is to come; the
substance is in the Christ. Do not let anyone defraud you of the reality
by affecting delight in so-called "humility" and angel-worship. Such a
person busies themselves with their visions, and without reason are
rendered conceited by their merely human intellect. They fail to
maintain union with the head, to whom it is due that the whole body,
nourished and knit together by the contact and connexion of every part,
grows with a divine growth.

     Since, with Christ, you became dead to the puerile teaching of this
world, why do you submit, as if you still belonged to the world, to such
ordinances as "Do not handle, or taste, or touch"? For all the things
referred to in them cease to exist when used. You are following mere
human directions and instructions. Such prohibitions appear reasonable
where there is a desire for self-imposed service, and so-called
"humility," and harsh treatment of the body, but are of no real value
against the indulgence of our earthly nature.  Since, therefore, you
were raised to life with the Christ, seek for the things that are above;
for it is there that the Christ is seated at the right hand of God. Fix
your thoughts on the things that are above, not on those that are on
earth. For you died, and your life now lies hidden, with the Christ, in
God. When the Christ, who is our life, appears, then you also will
appear with him in glory.

*The Gospel in the Daily Life*

     Therefore destroy all that is earthly in you -- immorality,
uncleanness, passions, evil desires, and that greed which is idolatry.
These are the things because of which the wrath of God comes, and to
which you, like others, once devoted your lives, when you lived for
them. You, however, must now lay aside all such things -- anger,
passion, malice, slander, abuse. Never lie to one another. Get rid of
your old self and its habits, and clothe yourselves with that new self,
which, as it gains in knowledge, is being constantly renewed in
resemblance to him who made it. In that new life there is no distinction
between Greek and Jew, circumcised and uncircumcised, barbarian,
Scythian, slave, free; but Christ is all! -- and in all!
     Therefore, as God's people, consecrated and dear to him, clothe
yourselves with tenderness of heart, kindliness, humility, gentleness,
forbearance; bearing with one another, and, when there is any ground for
complaint, forgiving one another freely. As the Master freely forgave
you, so you must forgive one another. Over all these virtues put on
love; for that is the belt which makes all complete. Let the peace that
the Christ gives decide all doubts within your hearts; for you also were
called to the enjoyment of peace as members of one body. And show
yourselves thankful. Let the message of the Christ be alive in your
minds in all its wealth, bringing all wisdom with it. Teach and admonish
one another with psalms, and hymns, and sacred songs, full of the loving
kindness of God, lifting your hearts in song to him. And, whatever you
say or do, do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus; and through him
offer thanksgiving to God the father.

     Wives, submit to your husbands, as befits those who belong to the
Lord. Husbands, love your wives, and never treat them harshly. Children,
always obey your parents; for that is pleasant to see in those who
belong to the Lord. Fathers, never irritate your children, otherwise
they might become disheartened. Slaves, always obey your earthly
masters, not only when their eyes are on you, as if you had but to
please people alone, but giving them ungrudging service, in your respect
for the Master. Whatever you do, do it with all your heart, as if
working for the Master and not for people, since you know that it is
from the Master that you will receive the inheritance which will be your
reward. You are serving Christ, the Master. Those who do wrong will reap
the wrong they have done; and there will be no partiality.  Masters, do
what is right and fair by your slaves, for you know that you also have a
Master -- in heaven.

     Devote yourselves to prayer. Give your whole mind to it, and also
offer thanksgiving; and at the same time pray for us, so that God may
give us an opening for our message, so that we may speak of the truths
hidden in the Christ -- the truths for which I am in chains! Then I will
make them known, as I ought to do. Show tact in your behaviour to the
outside world, making the most of every opportunity. Let your
conversation always be kindly, but not bland, season it, as it were,
with salt; be aware in each case of the answer you should be giving.

*Conclusion*

     Our dear friend, Tychicus, will tell you all about me. He is a
faithful minister, and a fellow servant in the Master's cause. I send
him to you expressly that you may learn our circumstances, and that he
may give you encouragement. With him will be Onesimus, our dear faithful
friend, who is one of yourselves. They will tell you all that is going
on here.

     My fellow prisoner, Aristarchus, sends you his greeting, and
Barnabas's cousin, Mark, sends his. (You have received directions about
him. If he comes to you, make him welcome.) Joshua, who is called
Justus, also sends his greeting. These are the only converts from
Judaism who have worked with me for the kingdom of God; I have found
them a great comfort. Epaphras, who is one of yourselves, sends you his
greeting. He is a servant of Christ Jesus, and is always most earnest in
your behalf in his prayers, praying that you may stand firm, with a
matured faith and with a sure conviction of all that is in accordance
with God's will. I can bear testimony to the deep interest he takes in
you, as well as in the followers at Laodicea and at Hierapolis. Luke,
our dear doctor, sends you his greeting, and Demas sends his. Give my
greeting to the followers at Laodicea, and to Nymphe, and to the church
that meets at her house. And when this letter has been read to you, see
that it is also read before the church at Laodicea, and that you
yourselves read the letter which will be forwarded from there. Give this
message to Archippus -- "Take care to discharge to the best of your
ability the office to which you were appointed in the Master's cause."

     I, Paul, add this greeting in my own handwriting. Remember these
chains of mine. God's blessing be with you.

                       PAUL'S FIRST LETTER TO THE
                             THESSALONIANS


*Introduction*

     To the Thessalonian church in union with God the Father and the
Lord Jesus Christ, from Paul, Silas, and Timothy. May God bless you and
give you peace.

*The Apostle and his Converts*

     We always mention you in our prayers and thank God for you all;
recalling continually before our God and Father the efforts that have
resulted from your faith, the toil prompted by your love, and the
patient endurance sustained by your hope in our Lord Jesus Christ.
Friends, whom God loves, we know that he has chosen you, because the
good news that we brought came home to you, not merely as so many words,
but with a power and a fulness of conviction due to the Holy Spirit. For
you know the life that we lived among you for your good. And you
yourselves began to follow, not only our example, but the Master's also;
and, in spite of much suffering, you welcomed the message with a joy
inspired by the Holy Spirit, and so became a pattern to all who believed
in Christ throughout Macedonia and Greece. For it was from you that the
Lord's message resounded throughout Macedonia and Greece; and, more than
that, your faith in God has become known far and wide; so that there is
no need for us to say another word. Indeed, in speaking about us, the
people themselves tell of the reception you gave us, and how, turning to
God from your idols, you became servants of the true and living God, and
are now awaiting the return from heaven of his Son whom he raised from
the dead -- Jesus, our deliverer from the coming wrath.
     Yes, friends, you yourselves know that your reception of us was not
without result. For, although we had experienced suffering and ill
treatment, as you know, at Philippi, we had the courage, by the help of
our God, to tell you God's good news in spite of great opposition. Our
appeal to you was not based on a delusion, nor was it made from unworthy
motives, or with any intention of misleading you. But, having been found
worthy by God to be entrusted with the good news, therefore we tell it;
with a view to please, not people, but God who proves our hearts. Never
at any time, as you know, did we use the language of flattery, or make
false professions in order to hide selfish aims. God will bear witness
to that. Nor did we seek to win honour from people, whether from you or
from others, although, as apostles of Christ, we might have burdened you
with our support. But we lived among you with the simplicity of a child;
we were like a woman nursing her own children. In our strong affection
for you, that seemed to us the best way of sharing with you, not only
God's good news, but our lives as well -- so dear had you become to us.
You will not have forgotten, friends, our labour and toil. Night and day
we used to work at our trades, so as not be a burden to any of you,
while we proclaimed to you God's good news. You will bear witness, and
God also, that our relations with you who believed in Christ were pure,
and upright, and beyond reproach. Indeed, you know that, like a father
with his own children, we used to encourage and comfort every one of
you, and solemnly plead with you; so that you should make your daily
lives worthy of God who is calling you into the glory of his kingdom.

     This, too, is a reason why we, on our part, are continually
thanking God -- because, in receiving the teaching that you had from us,
you accepted it, not as the teaching of humans, but as what it really is
-- the teaching of God, which is even now doing its work within you who
believe in Christ. For you, friends, began to follow the example of the
churches of God in Judea which are in union with Jesus Christ; you, in
your turn, suffering at the hands of your fellow citizens, in the same
way as those churches did at the hands of their people -- who killed
both the Lord Jesus and the prophets, and persecuted us also. They do
not try to please God, and they are enemies to all humanity, for they
try to prevent us from speaking to the Gentiles with a view to their
salvation, and so are always filling up the measure of their iniquity.
But the wrath of God has come upon them to the full!
     As for ourselves, friends, our having been bereaved of you even for
a short time -- though in body only, and not in spirit -- made us all
the more eager to see your faces again; and the longing to do so was
strong on us. That was why we made up our minds to go and see you -- at
least I, Paul, did, more than once -- but Satan put difficulties in our
way. For what hope or joy will be ours, or what crown will we have to
boast of, in the presence of our Lord Jesus, at his coming, if it isn't
you? You are our pride and our delight!
     And so, as we could bear it no longer, we made up our minds to
remain behind alone at Athens, and sent Timothy, our dear friend and
God's minister of the good news of the Christ, to strengthen you, and to
encourage you in your faith, so that none of you should be shaken by the
troubles through which you are passing. You yourselves know that we are
destined to meet with such things. For, even while we were with you, we
warned you beforehand that we were certain to encounter trouble. And so
it proved, as you know. Therefore, since I could no longer endure the
uncertainty, I sent to make inquiries about your faith, fearing that the
Tempter had tempted you, and that our toil might prove to have been in
vain. But, when Timothy recently returned to us from you with good news
of your faith and love, and told us how kindly you think of us -- always
longing, he said, to see us, just as we are longing to see you -- on
hearing this, we felt encouraged about you, friends, in the midst of all
our difficulties and troubles, by your faith. For it is new life to us
to know that you are holding fast to the Lord. How can we thank God
enough for all the happiness that you are giving us in the sight of our
God? Night and day we pray most earnestly that we may see you face to
face, and make good any deficiency in your faith.
     May our God and Father himself, and Jesus, our Lord, make the way
plain for us to come to you. And for you, may the Lord fill you to
overflowing with love for one another and for everyone, just as we are
filled with love for you; and so make your hearts strong, and your lives
pure beyond reproach, in the sight of our God and Father, at the coming
of our Lord Jesus, with all his Holy Ones.

*Advice on Daily Life*

     Further, friends, we beg and urge you in the name of our Lord Jesus
to carry out more fully than ever -- as indeed you are already doing --
all that you have heard from us as to what your daily life must be, if
it is to please God. For you have not forgotten the directions that we
gave you on the authority of our Lord Jesus.
     For this is God's purpose -- that you should be pure; abstaining
from all immorality; each of you learning to gain control over your own
body, in a way that is holy and honourable, and not for the mere
gratification of your passions, like the Gentiles who know nothing of
God; none of you overreaching or taking advantage of their fellow
follower of the Lord in such matters. The Lord takes vengeance on all
who do such things, as we have already warned you and solemnly declared.
For God does not call us to an impure life, but demands holiness.
Therefore the person who disregards this warning disregards, not people,
but God who gives you his Holy Spirit.
     As to love for each other there is no need to write to you; for you
have yourselves been taught by God to love one another; and indeed you
do act in this spirit towards all his people throughout Macedonia.
    Yet, friends, we beg you to do even more. Make it your ambition to
live quietly, and to attend to your own business, and to work with your
hands, as we directed you; so that your conduct may win respect from
those outside the church, and that you may not want for anything.

*The Dead in Christ at the coming of the Lord*

     We don't want you to be ignorant, friends, about those who have
passed to their rest. We don't want you to grieve like other people who
have no hope. For, as we believe that Jesus died and rose again, so also
we believe that God will bring, with Jesus, those who through him have
passed to their rest. This we tell you on the authority of the Lord --
that those of us who are still living at the coming of the Lord will not
anticipate those who have passed to their rest. For, with a loud
summons, with the shout of an archangel, and with the trumpet-call of
God, the Lord himself will come down from heaven. Then those who died in
union with Christ will rise first; and afterwards we who are still
living will be caught up in the clouds, with them, to meet the Lord in
the air; and so we will be for ever with the Lord. Therefore, comfort
one another with what I have told you.
     But as to the times and the moments, there is no need, friends, for
anyone to write to you. You yourselves know well that the day of the
Lord will come just as a thief comes in the night. When people are
saying "All is quiet and safe," it is then that, like birth pains on a
pregnant woman, ruin comes suddenly upon them, and there will be no
escape! You, however, friends, are not in darkness, that the daylight
should take you by surprise as if you were thieves. For you all are
children of light and children of the day.
    We have nothing to do with night, or darkness. Therefore let us not
sleep as others do. No, let us be watchful and self-controlled. It is at
night that people sleep, and at night that drunkards get drunk. But let
us, who belong to the day, control ourselves, and put on faith and love
as a breast plate, and the hope of salvation as a helmet. For God
destined us, not for wrath, but to win salvation through our Lord Jesus
Christ, who died for us, that, whether we are still watching or have
fallen asleep, we may live with him. Therefore encourage one another,
and try to build up one another's characters, as indeed you are doing.

*Conclusion*

     We beg you, friends, to value those who toil among you, and are
your leaders in the Lord's service, and give you counsel. Hold them in
the very greatest esteem and affection for the sake of their work. Live
at peace with one another. We entreat you also, friends -- warn the
disorderly, comfort the faint-hearted, give a helping hand to the weak,
and be patient with everyone. Take care that none of you ever pays back
wrong for wrong, but always follow the kindest course with one another
and with everyone. Always be joyful; never cease to pray; under all
circumstances give thanks to God. For this is his will for you as made
known in Christ Jesus. Do not quench the Spirit; do not make light of
preaching. Bring everything to the test; cling to what is good; shun
every form of evil. May God himself, the giver of peace, make you
altogether holy; and may your spirits, souls, and bodies be kept
altogether faultless until the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. He who
calls you will not fail you; he will complete his work.
     Friends, pray for us.

     Greet all the Lord's followers with a sacred kiss. I order you in
the Lord's name to have this letter read to all the brethren.

     May the blessing of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.

                      PAUL'S SECOND LETTER TO THE
                             THESSALONIANS


*Introduction*

     To the Thessalonian church in union with God our Father and the
Lord Jesus Christ, From Paul, Silas, and Timothy. May God, the Father,
and the Lord Jesus Christ bless you and give you peace.

*The Apostle and his Converts*

     Friends, it is our duty always to thank God about you, as is but
right, considering the wonderful growth of your faith, and because,
without exception, your love for one another is continually increasing.
So much is this the case that we ourselves speak with pride, before the
churches of God, of the patience and faith which you have shown, in
spite of all the persecutions and troubles that you are enduring. These
persecutions will vindicate the justice of God's judgment, and will
result in your being reckoned worthy of God's kingdom, for the sake of
which you are now suffering; since God deems it just to inflict
suffering on those who are now inflicting suffering on you, and to give
relief to you who are suffering, as well as to us, at the appearing of
the Lord Jesus from heaven with his mighty angels, in flaming fire. Then
he will inflict punishment on those who refuse to know God, and on those
who turn a deaf ear to the good news of Jesus, our Lord. They will pay
the penalty of unutterable ruin -- banished from the presence of the
Lord and from the glorious manifestation of his might, when he comes to
be honoured in his people, and to be revered in all who have learned to
believe in him (for you also believed our testimony) -- as he will be on
that day. With this in view, our constant prayer for you is that our God
may count you worthy of the call that you have received, and by his
power make perfect your delight in all goodness and the efforts that
have resulted from your faith. Then, in the loving kindness of our God
and the Lord Jesus Christ, will the name of Jesus, our Lord, be honoured
in you, and you in him.

*Events that must precede the Lord's Coming*

     As to the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and our being gathered
to meet him, we beg you, friends, not lightly to let your minds become
unsettled or disturbed by any revelation, or by any message or letter
purporting to come from us, to the effect that the day of the Lord is
come. Don't let anyone deceive you in any way. For it will not come
before the final rebellion against God, when lawlessness is revealed in
human form, headed for destruction. He is the adversary of everything
that is spoken of as a god or as an object of worship, enthroning
himself in God"s Temple claiming to be God! Don't you remember how, when
I was with you, I used to speak to you of all this? And you know now
what the restraining influence is which prevents his appearing before
his appointed time. Wickedness, indeed, is already at work in secret,
but only until he who at present restrains it is removed out of the way.
Then the lawless person will be revealed, but the Lord Jesus will
destroy him with the breath of his mouth, annihilate him by the
splendour of his coming. When the lawless person comes, there will be
great activity on the part of Satan, in the form of all kinds of
deceptive miracles, signs, and marvels, as well as of wicked attempts to
delude -- to the ruin of those who are on the path to destruction,
because they have never received and loved the truth to their own
salvation. That is why God places them under the influence of a
delusion, to cause them to believe a lie; so that sentence may be passed
on all those who refuse to believe the truth, but delight in wickedness.

     But, friends, whom the Lord loves, it is our duty always to thank
God about you, for, from the first, God chose you for salvation through
the purifying influence of the Spirit, and your belief in the truth. To
this you were called by the good news which we brought you, to attain to
the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ. Stand firm then, friends, and hold
fast to the truths that we taught you, whether by word or by letter. And
may our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God our Father, who loved us and,
in his loving kindness, gave us unfailing consolation and good ground
for hope, console your hearts, and strengthen you to do and to say all
that is right.

*Conclusion*

     In conclusion, friends, pray for us -- pray that the Lord's message
may spread rapidly, and be received everywhere with honour, as it was
among you; and that we may be preserved from wrong-headed and wicked
people -- for it is not everyone who believes in Christ. But the Lord
will not fail you. He will give you strength, and guard you from evil.
Yes, and the confidence that our union with the Lord enables us to place
in you leads us to believe that you are doing, and will do, what we
direct you. May the Lord bring you to the love of God, and to the
patience of the Christ.

     We beg you, friends, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, to avoid
any follower who is living an ill-ordered life, which is not in
agreement with the teaching that you received from us. For you know well
that you ought to follow our example. When we were with you, our life
was not ill-ordered, nor did we eat anyone's bread without paying for
it. Night and day, labouring and toiling, we used to work at our trades,
so as not to be a burden on any of you. This was not because we had not
a right to receive support, but our object was to give you a pattern for
you to copy. Indeed, when we were with you, the rule we laid down was --
"Whoever does not choose to work will not get to eat." We hear that
there are among you people who are living ill-ordered lives, and who,
instead of attending to their own business, are mere busybodies. All
such people we beg, and implore, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ,
to attend quietly to their business, and earn their own living. You,
friends, must not grow weary of doing what is right. If anyone
disregards what we have said in this letter, take note of them and avoid
their company, so that they may feel ashamed. Yet do not think of them
as an enemy, but caution them as you would a brother or sister. May the
Lord, from whom all peace comes, himself give you his peace at all times
and in all ways. May he be with you all.

     I, Paul, add this greeting in my own handwriting. It is my
signature to every letter. This is how I write. May the blessing of our
Lord Jesus Christ be with you all.

                         PAUL'S FIRST LETTER TO
                                TIMOTHY


*Introduction*

     From Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the appointment of God,
our Saviour, and Christ Jesus, our hope. To Timothy, my true child in
the faith: May God, the Father, and Christ Jesus, our Lord, bless you,
and be merciful to you, and give you peace.

     I beg you, as I did when I was on my way into Macedonia, to remain
at Ephesus; so that you may instruct certain people there not to teach
new and strange doctrines, nor to devote their attention to legends and
interminable genealogies, which tend to give rise to argument rather
than to further that divine plan which is revealed in the faith. The
object of all instruction is to call forth that love which comes from a
pure heart, a clear conscience, and a sincere faith. And it is because
they have not aimed at these things that the attention of certain people
has been diverted to unprofitable subjects. They want to be teachers of
the Law, and yet do not understand either the words they use, or the
subjects on which they speak so confidently. We know, of course, that
the Law is excellent, when used legitimately, by one who recognises that
laws were not made for good people, but for the lawless and disorderly,
for irreligious and wicked people, for those who are irreverent and
profane, for those who ill-treat their fathers or mothers, for
murderers, for the immoral, for perverts, for slave traders, for liars,
for perjurers, and for whatever else is opposed to sound Christian
teaching -- as is taught in the glorious good news of the ever-blessed
God, with which I was entrusted.
     I am thankful to Christ Jesus, our Lord, who has been my strength,
for showing that he thought me worthy of trust by appointing me to his
ministry, though I once used to blaspheme, and to persecute, and to
insult. Yet mercy was shown me, because I acted in ignorance, while
still an unbeliever; and the loving kindness of our Lord was boundless,
and filled me with that faith and love which come from union with Christ
Jesus. How true the saying is, and worthy of the fullest acceptance,
that "Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners"! And there is no
greater sinner than I! Yet mercy was shown me for the express purpose
that Christ Jesus might exhibit in my case, beyond all others, his
exhaustless patience, as an example for those who were afterwards to
believe on him and attain eternal life. To the eternal King, ever-
living, invisible, the one God, be ascribed honour and glory for ever
and ever. Amen.
     This, then, is the charge that I lay on you, Timothy, my child, in
accordance with what was predicted of you -- Fight the good fight in the
spirit of those predictions, with faith, and with a clear conscience;
and it is because they have thrust this aside, that, as regards the
faith, some have wrecked their lives. Hymenaeus and Alexander are
instances -- the men whom I delivered over to Satan so that they might
be taught not to blaspheme.

*General Directions on Church Matters*

     First of all, then, I ask that petitions, prayers, intercessions,
and thanksgivings should be offered for everyone, especially for kings
and all who are in high positions, in order that we may lead a quiet and
peaceful life in a deeply religious and reverent spirit. This will be
good and acceptable in the eyes of God, our Saviour, whose will is that
everyone should be saved, and attain to a full knowledge of the truth.
There is but one God, and one mediator between God and humanity -- the
human, Christ Jesus, who gave himself as a ransom on behalf of all.
    This must be our testimony, as opportunities present themselves; and
it was for this that I was myself appointed a herald and an apostle (I
am telling the simple truth and no lie) -- a teacher of the Gentiles in
the faith and truth.
     My desire, then, is that it should be the custom everywhere for the
men to lead the prayers, with hands reverently uplifted, avoiding heated
controversy.
     I also desire that women should adorn themselves with appropriate
dress, worn quietly and modestly, and not with wreaths or gold ornaments
for the hair, or pearls, or costly clothing, but -- as is proper for
women who profess to be religious -- with good actions. They must learn,
listening quietly to their teachers and showing them all deference. I do
not consent to them becoming teachers, or exercising authority over men;
they ought to not make a fuss. Adam was formed first, not Eve. And it
was not Adam who was deceived; it was the woman who was entirely
deceived and fell into sin. But she will be saved by the birth of a
child, if they never abandon faith, love, or holiness, and behave with
modesty.
     How true is this saying:"To aspire to be to be a supervisor in the
church is to be ambitious for a noble task." The supervisor should be of
blameless character; a faithful partner; living a temperate, discreet,
and well-ordered life; hospitable, and a skilful teacher, not addicted
to drink or brawling, but of a forbearing and peaceable disposition, and
not a lover of money; they should provide for their own household well,
and their children should kept under control and be well-behaved. If
someone does not know how to provide for their own household, how can
they take charge of the church of God? The supervisor should not be a
recent convert, or they might become blinded by pride and fall under the
same judgement as the devil. They should also be well spoken of by
outsiders, so that they may not incur censure and so fall into the
devil's trap. So, too, assistants should be serious and straightforward,
not given to taking much drink or to questionable money-making, but
people who hold the deep truths of the faith and have a clear
conscience. They should be tested first, and only appointed to their
office if no objection is raised against them. It should be the same
with the women in this office. They should be serious, not gossips,
sober, and trustworthy in all respects. Assistants should be faithful
partners who manage their children and their households well. Those who
have filled that post with honour gain for themselves an honourable
position, as well as great confidence through the faith that they place
in Christ Jesus.

*Special Directions to Timothy*

     I am writing this to you, though I hope that I will come to see you
before long; but in case I should be delayed, I want you to know what
your conduct ought to be in the household of God, which is the church of
the living God -- the pillar and stay of the truth. Yes, and undeniably
wonderful are the deep truths of our religion; for --

     "He was revealed in our nature,
         pronounced righteous in spirit,
             seen by angels,
     proclaimed among the Gentiles,
         believed on in the world,
             taken up into glory."
  But the Spirit distinctly says that in later times there will be some
who will fall away from the faith, and devote their attention to
misleading spirits, and to the teaching of demons, who will make use of
the hypocrisy of lying teachers. These people's consciences are seared,
and they discourage marriage and enjoin abstinence from certain kinds of
food; though God created these foods to be enjoyed thankfully by those
who hold the faith and have attained a full knowledge of the truth.
Everything created by God is good, and there in nothing that need be
rejected -- provided only that it is received thankfully; for it is
consecrated by God's blessing and by prayer.
     Put all this before the followers, and you will be a good servant
of Christ Jesus, sustained by the precepts of the faith and of that good
teaching by which you have guided your life. As for profane legends and
old wives' tales, leave them alone. Train yourself to lead a religious
life; for while the training of the body is of service in some respects,
religion is of service in all, carrying with it, as it does, a promise
of life both here and hereafter. How true that saying is and worthy of
the fullest acceptance! With that aim we toil and struggle, for we have
set our hopes on the living God, who is the Saviour of all, and
especially of those who hold the faith.

     Remember these things in your teaching. Do not let anyone look down
on you because you are young, but, by your conversation, your conduct,
your love, your faith, and your purity, be an example to those who hold
the faith. Until I come, apply yourself to public reading, preaching,
and teaching. Do not neglect the divine gift within you, which was given
you, amid many a prediction, when the hands of the church elders were
laid on your head. Practice these things, devote yourself to them, so
that your progress may be plain to everyone. Look to yourself as well as
to your teaching. Persevere in this, for your doing so will mean
salvation for yourself as well as for your hearers.
     Do not reprimand an older man, but plead with him as if he were
your father. Treat the young men as brothers, the older women as
mothers, and the younger women as sisters -- with all purity. Show
consideration for widows -- I mean those who are really widowed. But, if
a widow has children or grandchildren, they should learn to show proper
regard for the members of their own family first, and to make some
return to their parents; for that is pleasing in God's sight. As for the
woman who is really widowed and left quite alone, her hopes are fixed on
God, and she devotes herself to prayers and supplications night and day.
But the life of a widow who is devoted to pleasure is a living death.
Those are the points you should teach, so that there may be no call for
your censure. Anyone who fails to provide for their own relatives, and
especially for those under their own roof, has disowned the faith, and
is worse than an unbeliever. A widow, when her name is added to the
list, should not be less than sixty years old; she should have been a
faithful wife, and be well spoken of for her kind actions. She should
have brought up children, have shown hospitality to strangers, have
washed the feet of her fellow Christians, have relieved those who were
in distress, and devoted herself to every kind of good action. But you
should exclude the younger widows from the list; for, when they grow
restive under the yoke of the Christ, they want to marry, and so they
bring condemnation on themselves for having broken their previous
promise. And not only that, but they learn to be idle as they go about
from house to house. Nor are they merely idle, but they also become
gossips and busybodies, and talk of what they ought not. Therefore I
advise young widows to marry, bear children, and attend to their homes,
and so avoid giving the enemy an opportunity for scandal. There are some
who have already left us, to follow Satan. Any Christian woman, who has
relatives who are widows, ought to relieve them and not allow them to
become a burden to the church, so that the church may relieve those
widows who are really widowed.
     Those church elders who fill their office well should be held
deserving of especial consideration, particularly those whose work lies
in preaching and teaching. The words of scripture are --

     "You should not muzzle the ox while it is treading out the grain."

 and again --

     "The worker is worth their wages."
 Do not entertain a charge against an church elder, unless it is
supported by two or three witnesses; but rebuke offenders publicly, so
that others may take warning. I charge you solemnly, before God and
Christ Jesus and the chosen angels, to carry out these directions,
unswayed by prejudice, never acting with partiality. Never ordain anyone
hastily, and take no part in the wrongdoing of others. Keep your life
pure. Do not continue to drink water only, but take a little wine
because of the weakness of your stomach, and your frequent ailments.
There are some people whose sins are conspicuous and lead on to
judgment, while there are others whose sins dog their steps. In the same
way noble deeds become conspicuous, and those which are otherwise cannot
be concealed.
     All who are in the position of slaves should regard their masters
as deserving of the greatest respect, so that the name of God, and our
teaching, may not be maligned. Those who have Christian masters should
not think less of them because they are also followers of Christ, but on
the contrary they should serve them all the better, because those who
are to benefit by their good work are dear to them as their fellow
Christians.

*Conclusion*
    Those are the things to insist on in your teaching.
     Anyone who teaches otherwise, and refuses their assent to sound
instruction -- the instruction of our Lord Jesus Christ -- and to the
teaching of religion, is puffed up with conceit, not really knowing
anything, but having a morbid craving for discussions and arguments.
Such things only give rise to envy, quarrelling, recriminations, base
suspicions, and incessant wrangling on the part of these corrupt-minded
people who have lost all hold on the truth, and who think of religion
only as a source of gain. Of course religion is a great source of gain
-- when combined with contentment! For we brought nothing into the
world, because we cannot even carry anything out of it. So, with food
and shelter, we will be content. Those who want to be rich fall into the
net of temptation, and become the prey of many foolish and harmful
ambitions, which plunge people into destruction and ruin. Love of money
is a source of all kinds of evil; and in their eagerness to be rich some
have wandered away from the faith, and have been pierced to the heart by
many a regret.
     But you must, servant of God, avoid all this. Aim at righteousness,
piety, faith, love, endurance, gentleness. Run the great race of the
faith, and win the eternal life. It was for this that you received the
call, and, in the presence of many witnesses, made the great profession
of faith. I beg you, as in the sight of God, the source of all life, and
of Christ Jesus who before Pontius Pilate made the great profession of
faith -- I implore you to keep his command free from stain or reproach,
until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ. This will be brought about
in his own time by the one ever-blessed Potentate, the king of all kings
and Lord of all lords, who alone is possessed of immortality and dwells
in unapproachable light, whom no one has ever seen or ever can see -- to
whom be ascribed honour and power for ever. Amen.
     Teach those who are wealthy in this life not to pride themselves,
or fix their hopes, on so uncertain a thing as wealth, but on God, who
gives us a wealth of enjoyment on every side. Teach them to show
kindness, to exhibit a wealth of good actions, to be open-handed and
generous, storing up for themselves what in the future will prove to be
a good foundation, so that they may gain the only true life.
     Timothy, guard what has been entrusted to you. Avoid the profane
prattle and contradictions of what some miscall "theology," for there
are those who, while asserting their proficiency in it, have yet, as
regards the faith, gone altogether astray.

     God bless you all.

                        PAUL'S SECOND LETTER TO
                                TIMOTHY


*Introduction*

     From Paul who, by the will of God, is an apostle of Christ Jesus,
charged to proclaim the life that comes from union with Christ Jesus, to
Timothy, my dear child: may God, the Father, and Christ Jesus, our Lord,
bless you, and be merciful to you, and give you peace.

     I am thankful to God, whom I serve, as my ancestors did, with a
clear conscience, when I remember you, as I never fail to do, in my
prayers -- night and day alike, as I think of your tears, longing to see
you, that my happiness may be completed, now that I have been reminded
of the sincere faith that you have shown. That faith was seen first in
your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice, and is now, I am
convinced, in you also. And that is my reason for reminding you to stir
into flame that gift of God, which is yours through your ordination at
my hands. For the Spirit which God gave us was not a spirit of
cowardice, but a spirit of power, love, and self-control. Do not,
therefore, be ashamed of the testimony which we have to bear to our
Lord, or of me imprisoned for his sake; but join with me in suffering
for the good news, as far as God enables you. It was God who saved us,
and from him we received our solemn call -- not as a reward for anything
that we had done, but in fulfilment of his own loving purpose. For that
love was extended to us, through Christ Jesus, before time began, and
has now been made apparent through the appearing of our Saviour, Christ
Jesus; who has made an end of death, and has brought life and
immortality to light by that good news, of which I was myself appointed
a herald, apostle, and teacher. That is why I am undergoing these
sufferings; yet I feel no shame, for I know in whom I have put my faith,
and am convinced that he is able to guard what I have entrusted to him
until that day. Keep before you, as an example of sound teaching, all
that you learnt from me as you listened with that faith and love which
come from union with Christ Jesus. Guard by the help of the Holy Spirit,
who is within us, the glorious trust that has been committed to you.
     You know, of course, that all our friends in Roman Asia turned
their backs on me, including Phygellus and Hermogenes. May the Lord show
mercy to the household of Onesiphorus; for he often cheered me and was
not ashamed of my chains. On the contrary, when he arrived in Rome, he
sought eagerly for me until he found me. The Lord grant that he may find
mercy at the hands of the Lord on that day. The many services that he
rendered at Ephesus you have the best means of knowing.

*Injunctions to Timothy*

     You must, then, my child, find strength in the help which comes
from the union with Christ Jesus; and what you learnt from me, in the
presence of many listeners, entrust to reliable people, who will be able
in their turn to teach others. Share hardships with me, as a true
soldier of Christ Jesus. A soldier on active service, to please his
superior officer, always avoids entangling himself in the affairs of
ordinary life. No athlete is ever awarded the wreath of victory unless
they have kept the rules. The labourer who does the work should be the
first to receive a share of the fruits of the earth. Reflect on what I
say; the Lord will always help you to understand. Keep before your mind
Jesus Christ, raised from the dead, a descendant of David, as told in
the good news entrusted to me; in the service of which I am suffering
hardships, even to being put in fetters as a criminal. But the message
of God is not fettered; and that is why I submit to anything for the
sake of God's people: so that they also may obtain the salvation which
comes from union with Christ Jesus, and imperishable glory. How true
this saying is -- "If we have shared his death, we will also share his
life. If we continue to endure, we will also share his throne. If we
should ever disown him, he, too, will disown us. If we lose our trust,
he is still to be trusted, for he cannot be false to himself!"
     Remind people of all this; tell them solemnly, as in the sight of
God, to avoid controversy, a useless thing and the ruin of those who
listen to it. Do your utmost to show yourself true to God, a worker with
no reason to be ashamed, accurate in delivering the message of the
truth. Avoid profane prattle. Those who indulge in it only get deeper
into irreligious ways, and their teaching will spread like a cancer.
Hymenaeus and Philetus are instances of this. They have gone completely
astray as regards the truth; they say that a resurrection has already
taken place, and so upset some people's faith. Yet God's firm foundation
still stands unmoved, and it bears this inscription --

     "THE LORD KNOWS THOSE WHO ARE HIS";
 and this --

     "LET ALL THOSE WHO USE THE NAME OF THE LORD TURN AWAY FROM
WICKEDNESS."
 Now in a large house there are not only things of gold and silver, but
also others of wood and earthenware, some for better and some for common
use. If, then, a person has escaped from the pollution of such errors as
I have mentioned, they will be like a thing kept for better use, set
apart, serviceable to its owner, ready for any good purpose. Flee from
the passions of youth, but pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace,
in the company of those who, with a pure heart, invoke the Lord. Shun
foolish and ignorant discussions, for you know that they only breed
quarrels; and a servant of the Lord should never quarrel. They ought, on
the contrary, to be courteous to everyone, skilful teachers, and
forbearing. They should instruct their opponents in a gentle spirit;
for, possibly, God may give those opponents a repentance that will lead
to a fuller knowledge of truth, and they may yet come to a sober mind,
and escape from the devil's net, when captured by the Lord's servant to
do the will of God.

     Be sure of this, that in the last days difficult times will come.
People will be selfish, mercenary, boastful, haughty, and blasphemous;
disobedient to their parents, ungrateful, impure, incapable of
affection, merciless, slanderous, wanting in self-control, brutal,
careless of the right, treacherous, reckless, and puffed up with pride;
they will love pleasure more than they love God; and while they retain
the outward form of religion, they will not allow it to influence them.
Turn your back on such people as these. For among them are to be found
those who creep into homes and captivate weak women -- women who, loaded
with sins, and slaves to all kinds of passions, are always learning, and
yet never able to attain to a real knowledge of the truth. Just as
Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so do these people, in their turn,
oppose the truth. Their minds are corrupted, and, as regards the faith,
they are utterly worthless. They will not, however, make further
progress; for their wicked folly will be plain to everyone, just as the
folly Jannes and Jambres was. But you, Timothy, were a close observer of
my teaching, my conduct, my purposes, my faith, my forbearance, my love,
and my patient endurance, as well as of my persecutions, and of the
sufferings which I met with at Antioch, Iconium, and Lystra. You know
what persecutions I underwent; and yet the Lord brought me safe out of
all! Yes, and all who aim at living a religious life in union with
Christ Jesus will have to suffer persecution; but wicked people and
impostors will go from bad to worse, deceiving others and deceived
themselves. You, however, must stand by what you learnt and accepted as
true. You know who they were from whom you learnt it; and that, from
your childhood, you have known the sacred writings, which can give you
the wisdom that, through belief in Christ Jesus, leads to salvation. All
scripture is God-breathed: helpful for teaching, for refuting error, for
giving guidance, and for training others in righteousness; so that God's
people may be capable and equipped for good work of every kind.
     I solemnly charge you -- in the sight of God and of Christ Jesus,
who will one day judge the living and the dead -- I charge you by his
appearing and by his kingdom: Proclaim the message, be ready in season
and out of season, convince, rebuke, encourage, never failing to
instruct with forbearance. For a time will come when people will not
tolerate sound teaching. They will follow their own wishes, and, in
their itching for novelty, procure themselves a crowd of teachers. They
will turn a deaf ear to the truth, and give their attention to legends
instead. But you, Timothy, must always be temperate. Face hardships; do
the work of a missionary; discharge all the duties of your office.
     As for me, my life blood is already being poured out; the time of
my departure is close at hand. I have run the great race; I have
finished the course; I have kept the faith. And now the crown of
righteousness awaits me, which the Lord, the just judge, will give me on
that day -- and not only to me, but to all who have loved his appearing.

*Conclusion*

     Do your utmost to come to me soon, for Demas, in his love for the
world, has deserted me. He has gone to Thessalonica, Crescens to
Galatia, and Titus to Dalmatia. There is no one but Luke with me. Pick
up Mark on your way, and bring him with you, for he is useful to me in
my work. I have sent Tychicus to Ephesus. Bring with you, when you come,
the cloak which I left at Troas with Carpus, and the books, especially
the parchments. Alexander, the coppersmith, showed much ill feeling
towards me. The Lord will give him what his actions deserve. You must
also be on your guard against him, for he is strongly opposed to our
teaching. At my first trial no one stood by me. They all deserted me.
May it never be counted against them! But the Lord came to my help and
strengthened me, in order that, through me, the proclamation should be
made so widely that all the Gentiles should hear it; and I was rescued
out of the lion's mouth. The Lord will rescue me from all evil, and
bring me safe into his Heavenly kingdom. All glory to him for ever and
ever! Amen.

     Give my greeting to Prisca and Aquila, and to the household of
Onesiphorus. Erastus remained at Corinth, and I left Thophimus ill at
Miletus. Do your utmost to come before winter. Eubulus, Pudens, Linus
and Claudia send you their greetings, and so do the rest of the Lord's
followers.

     May the Lord be with your soul. God bless you all.

                            PAUL'S LETTER TO
                                 TITUS


*Introduction*

     From Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, on
behalf of the faith of God's chosen people, and their knowledge of that
truth which makes for godliness -- and is based on the hope of eternal
life, which God, who never lies, promised before the ages began, and has
revealed at his own time in his message, with the preaching of which I
was entrusted by the command of God our Saviour. To Titus, my true child
in our shared faith: May God, the Father, and Christ Jesus, our Saviour,
bless you and give you peace.

*Mission of Titus in Crete*

     My reason for leaving you in Crete was that you might put in order
what had been left unfinished, and appoint church elders in the various
towns, as I myself directed you. They are to be of irreproachable
character, faithful to their partners, whose children are believers in
Christ and have never been open to the charge of being wild or unruly.
For a supervisor, as God's steward, ought to be of blameless character
-- not arrogant or quick-tempered, not given to drunkeness, violence or
shady money-making. Instead, they should be hospitable, love what is
good, self-controlled, upright, people of holy life and disciplined,
holding firmly to the trustworthy message as it has been taught -- so
that they may be able to encourage others by sound teaching, as well as
to refute those who contradict it.
     For there are many undisciplined persons who lead others astray
with their nonsense, especially those of the group advocating the
necessity of circumcision. They need to be kept quiet as they disrupt
whole households by teaching what they ought not to teach, simply to
make shameful financial gain. It was a Cretan -- one of their own
prophets -- who said: "Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, and lazy
gluttons." This statement is true. Therefore rebuke them sharply, so
that they may be sound in the faith, and may pay no attention to Jewish
legends, or to the directions of those who turn their backs on the
truth. To those whose minds are pure, all things are ritually pure, but
to those whose minds are tainted and unbelieving nothing is pure, as
their minds and consciences are alike polluted. They claim to know God,
but by their actions they deny him. They are detestable and disobedient
and useless for any good work.

     You however, should speak of such subjects as properly have a place
in sound teaching. Teach that the older men should be soberly clear
minded, dignified and self-controlled -- sound in faith, love, and
patient endurance. So, too, that the older women should live reverent
lives, not slanderers, not slaves to excessive drinking. They should
teach what is good, so as to train the younger women to love their
husbands and children, and to be self-controlled, pure-minded, to be
watching over their home, to be kind, respecting the authority of their
husbands, so that no one will speak badly of God's message. In the same
way with the younger men -- encourage them to be self-controlled. In all
things, set an example of doing good. In your teaching, show integrity
and seriousness -- let the instruction that you give be sound and above
reproach, so that those who oppose you may be ashamed when they fail to
find anything bad to say about us. Tell slaves to respect their owner's
authority in all circumstances, and to try their best to please them.
Teach them not to contradict or to pilfer, but to show such praiseworthy
fidelity in everything, as to recommend the teaching about God our
Saviour by all that they do.
     For the loving kindness of God has been revealed, bringing
salvation for all, leading us to renounce ungodliness and worldly
desires, and to live self-controlled, upright, and godly lives here in
this present age, while awaiting our blessed hope -- the appearing in
glory of our great God and Saviour, Christ Jesus. For he gave himself on
our behalf, to deliver us from all wickedness, and to purify for himself
a people who should be truly his own and eager to do good. Tell them of
all this, and encourage and rebuke with all authority. Do not let anyone
belittle you.  Remind them to respect and obey the rulers and
authorities, to be ready for every kind of good work, to slander no one,
to avoid quarrelling, to be reasonable, and under all circumstances to
show a gentle spirit with all. There was a time when we ourselves were
foolish, disobedient, misled, enslaved to all kinds of desires and
pleasures, living in malice and envy, hating ourselves and hating one
another. But, when the kindness of God our Saviour and his love for
humanity appeared, he saved us, not as the result of any righteous
actions that we had done, but due to his mercy. He saved us though the
washing of rebirth and renewal by the power of the Holy Spirit, which he
poured out on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour -- so that,
having been put right with God through his grace, we become heirs to the
hope of eternal life. This saying is trustworthy! And it is on these
subjects that I want you to lay special emphasis, so that those who have
learned to trust in God may be careful to devote themselves to doing
good. Such subjects are excellent in themselves, and of benefit to all.
But have nothing to do with foolish controversies, or with genealogies,
or with quarrels, or fights about the Law. They are useless and futile.
If someone is causing divisions among you then, after giving them a
second warning, excuse yourself from them. You can be sure that such a
person has forsaken the truth and is in the wrong. They stand self-
condemned.

*Conclusion*

     As soon as I send Artemas or Tychicus to you, join me as quickly as
possible at Nicopolis, for I have arranged to spend the winter there. Do
your best to help Zenas, the teacher of the Law, and Apollos, on their
way, and see that they want for nothing. Let all our people learn to
devote themselves to doing good, so as to meet the most pressing needs,
and that their lives may not be unfruitful.

     All who are with me here send you their greeting. Give my greeting
to our friends in the faith.

     God bless you all.

                                PHILEMON


*Introduction*

     From Paul, now a prisoner for Christ Jesus, and from Timothy, a
fellow follower of the Lord. To our dear friend and fellow worker
Philemon, to our sister Apphia, to our fellow soldier Archippus; and to
the church that meets at Philemon's house; may God, our Father, and the
Lord Jesus Christ bless you and give you peace.

*Request regarding runaway slave*

     I always mention you in my prayers and thank God for you, because I
hear of the love and the faith which you show, not only to the Lord
Jesus, but also to all his people; and I pray that your participation in
the faith may result in action, as you come to a fuller realisation of
everything that is good and Christlike in us. I have indeed found great
joy and encouragement in your love, knowing, as I do, how the hearts of
Christ's people have been cheered, friend, by you.
     And so, though my union with Christ enables me, with all
confidence, to dictate the course that you should adopt, yet the claims
of love make me prefer to plead with you -- yes, even me, Paul, though I
am an ambassador for Christ Jesus and, now a prisoner for him as well. I
plead with you for this child of mine, Onesimus, to whom, in my prison,
I have become a father. Once he was of little service to you, but now he
has become of great service, not only to you, but to me as well; and I
am sending him back to you with this letter -- though it is like tearing
out of my heart. For my own sake I should like to keep him with me, so
that, while I am in prison for the good news, he might attend to my
wants on your behalf. But I do not wish to do anything without your
consent, because I want your generosity to be voluntary and not, as it
were, compulsory. It may be that he was separated from you for an hour,
for this reason, so that you might have him back for ever, no longer as
a slave, but as something better -- a dearly loved friend and follower
of the Lord, especially dear to me, and how much more so to you, not
only as a person, but as your fellow Christian! If, then, you count me
your friend, receive him as you would me. If he has caused you any loss,
or owes you anything, charge it to me. I, Paul, put my own hand to it --
I will repay you myself. I say nothing about your owing me your self.
Yes, friend, let me gain something from you because of your union with
the Lord. Cheer my heart by your Christlike spirit.

     Even as I write, I have such confidence in your compliance with my
wishes, that I am sure that you will do even more than I am asking.
Please also get a lodging ready for me, for I hope that I will be given
back to you all in answer to your prayers.

*Messages and Blessing*

     Epaphras, who is my fellow prisoner for Christ Jesus, sends you his
greeting; and Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my fellow workers,
send theirs.

     May the blessing of the Lord Jesus Christ rest on your souls.

                           THE LETTER TO THE
                                HEBREWS


*Christ the Mediator*

     God, who, of old, at many times and in many ways, spoke to our
ancestors, by the prophets, has in these latter days spoken to us by the
Son, whom he appointed the heir of all things, and through whom he made
the universe. For he is the radiance of the glory of God and the
expression of his being, upholding all creation by the power of his
word; and, when he had made an expiation for the sins of humanity, he
took his seat at the right hand of God's Majesty on high, having shown
himself as much greater than the angels as the name that he has
inherited surpasses theirs.
     For to which of the angels did God ever say --

     "You are my Son; this day I have become your Father"?

 or again --

     "I will be to him a Father, and he will be to me a Son"?
 And again, when God brought the firstborn into the world, he said --

     "Let all the angels of God bow down before him."
 Speaking of the angels, he said --

     "He makes the winds his angels
         and the flames of fire his servants";
 while of the Son he said --

     "God is your throne for ever and ever;
         the sceptre of his kingdom is the sceptre of Justice;
     You love righteousness and hates iniquity;
         therefore God, your God, has anointed you with the festal oil
more abundantly than your peers."
 Again --

     "You, Lord, in the beginning did lay the foundation of the earth,
     and the heavens are the work of your hands.
         They will perish, but you remain;
     as a garment they will all grow old;
     As a mantle you will fold them up,
     and as a garment they will be changed,
         but you are the same, and your years will know no end."
 To which of the angels has God ever said --

     "Sit you at my right hand
         until I put your enemies as a stool for your feet"?
 Are not all the angels spirits in the service of God, sent out to
minister for the sake of those who are destined to obtain salvation?
     Therefore we must give still more heed to what we were taught, so
we do not drift away. For, if the message which was delivered by angels
had its authority confirmed, so that every offence against it, or
neglect of it, met with a fitting requital, how can we, of all people,
expect to escape, if we disregard so great a salvation? It was the
Master who at the outset spoke of this salvation, and its authority was
confirmed for us by those who heard him, while God himself added his
testimony to it by signs, and marvels, and many different miracles, as
well as by imparting the Holy Spirit as he saw fit.

     God has not given to angels the control of that future world of
which we are speaking! No; a writer has declared somewhere --

     "What are mere mortals that you should remember them?
         Or human beings that you should care for them?
     You have made them, for a while, lower than angels;
         with glory and honour you have crowned them;
     you have set them over all that your hands have made;
         you have placed all things beneath their feet."

 This "placing of everything" under humanity means that there was
nothing which was not placed under them. As yet, however, we do not see
everything placed under humanity. What our eyes do see is Jesus, who was
made for a while lower than angels, now, because of his sufferings and
death, crowned with glory and honour; so that his tasting the bitterness
of death should, in God's loving kindness, be on behalf of all humanity.
It was, indeed, fitting that God, for whom and through whom all things
exist, should, when leading many children to glory, make the author of
their salvation perfect through suffering. For he who purifies, and
those whom he purifies, all spring from One; and therefore he is not
ashamed to call them his brothers and sisters. He says --

     "I will tell of your name to my brothers and sisters,
     in the midst of the congregation I will sing your praise."
 And again --

     "As for me, I will put my trust in God."

 And yet again --

     "See, here am I and the children whom God gave me."
 Therefore, since human nature is the common heritage of the children,
Jesus also shared it, in order that by death he might render powerless
him whose power lies in death -- that is, the devil -- and so might
deliver all those who, from fear of death, had all their lives been
living in slavery. It was not, surely, to the help of the angels that
Jesus came, but to the help of the descendants of Abraham. And
consequently it was necessary that he should in all points be made like
his brothers and sisters, in order that he might prove a merciful as
well as a faithful high priest in humanity's relations with God, for the
purpose of expiating the sins of his people. The fact that he himself
suffered under temptation enables him to help those who are tempted.

     Therefore, my Christian friends, you who, all alike, have received
the call from heaven, fix your attention on Jesus, the apostle and high
priest of our religion. See how faithful he was to the God who appointed
him, as Moses was in the whole house of God. He has been deemed worthy
of far higher honour than Moses, just as the founder of the house is
held in greater regard than the house itself. For every house has its
founder, and the founder of the universe is God. While the faithful
service of Moses in the whole house of God was that of a servant, whose
duty was to bear testimony to a message still to come, the faithfulness
of Christ was that of a son set over the house of God. And we are his
house -- if only we retain, unshaken to the end, the courage and
confidence inspired by our hope.
     Therefore, as the Holy Spirit says --

     "If today you hear God's voice,
     harden not your hearts, as when Israel provoked me
         on the day when they tried my patience in the desert,
     Where your ancestors tried my forbearance,
         and saw my mighty deeds for forty years.
     Therefore I was sorely vexed with that generation,
     and I said -- 'Their hearts are always straying;
         they have never learned my ways';
     While in my wrath I swore --
         'They will never enter upon my rest.'"
 Be careful, friends, that there is never found in anyone of you a
wicked and faithless heart, shown by that person separating themselves
from the living God. Rather encourage one another daily -- while there
is a today -- to prevent anyone among you from being hardened by the
deceitfulness of sin. For we now all share in the Christ, if indeed we
retain, unshaken to the end, the confidence that we had at the first. To
use the words of scripture --

     "If today you hear God's voice,
     harden not your hearts, as when Israel provoked me."
 Who were they who heard God speak and yet provoked him? Were not they
all those who left Egypt under the leadership of Moses? And with whom
was it that God was sorely vexed for forty years? Was not it with those
who had sinned, and who fell dead in the desert? And who were they to
whom God swore that they should not enter upon his rest, if not those
who had proved faithless? We see, then, that they failed to enter upon
it because of their want of faith.  We must, therefore, be very careful,
though there is a promise still standing that we will enter upon God's
rest, that none of you even appear to have missed it. For we have had
the good news told us just as they had. But the message which they heard
did them no good, since they did not share the faith of those who were
attentive to it. Upon that rest we who have believed are now entering.
As God has said --

     "In my wrath I swore --
         'They will never enter upon my rest;'"

 Although God's work was finished at the creation of the world; for, in
a passage referring to the seventh day, you will find these words --

     "God rested on the seventh day after all his work."
 On the other hand, we read in that passage --

     "They will never enter upon my rest."
 Since, then, there is still a promise that some will enter upon this
rest, and since those who were first told the good news did not enter
upon it, because of their disbelief, again God fixed a day. "Today," he
said, speaking after a long interval through the mouth of David, in the
passage already quoted --

     "If today you hear God's voice
     harden not your hearts."
 Now if Joshua had given "rest" to the people, God would not have spoken
of another and later day. There is, then, a Sabbath rest still awaiting
God's people. For the person who enters upon God's rest do themselves
rest after their work, just as God did. Let us, therefore, make every
effort to enter upon that rest, so that none of us fall through such
disbelief as that of which we have had an example. God's message is a
living and active power, sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing its
way until it penetrates soul and spirit -- not the joints only but the
marrow -- and detecting the inmost thoughts and purposes of the mind.
There is no created thing that can hide itself from the sight of God.
Everything is exposed and laid bare before the eyes of him to whom we
have to give account.
     We have, then, in Jesus, the Son of God, a great high priest who
has passed into the highest heaven; let us, therefore, hold fast to the
faith which we have professed. Our high priest is not one unable to
sympathise with our weaknesses, but one who has in every way been
tempted, exactly as we have been, but without sinning. Therefore, let us
draw near boldly to the throne of love, to find pity and love for the
hour of need.

     Every high priest, taken from among the people, is appointed as
their representative in their relations with God, to offer both gifts
and sacrifices in expiation of sins. And he is able to sympathise with
the ignorant and deluded, since he is himself subject to weakness, and
is therefore bound to offer sacrifices for sins, not only for the
people, but equally so for himself. Nor does anyone take that high
office on themselves, until they have been called to do so by God, as
Aaron was. In the same way, even the Christ did not take the honour of
the high priesthood on himself, but he was appointed by him who said to
him --

     "You are my Son; this day I have become your Father";
 and on another occasion also --

     "You are a priest for all time of the order of Melchizedek."
 Jesus, in the days of his earthly life, offered prayers and
supplications, with earnest cries and with tears, to him who was able to
save him from death; and he was heard because of his devout submission.
Son though he was, he learned obedience from his sufferings; and, being
made perfect, he became to all those who obey him the source of eternal
salvation, while God himself pronounced him a high priest of the order
of Melchizedek.

     Now on this subject I have much to say, but it is difficult to
explain it to you, because you have shown yourselves so slow to learn.
For whereas, considering the time that has elapsed, you ought to be
teaching others, you still need someone to teach you the alphabet of the
divine revelation, and need again to be fed with milk instead of with
"solid food." For everyone who still has to take milk knows nothing of
the teaching of righteousness; they are a mere infant. But solid food is
for Christians of mature faith -- those whose faculties have been
trained by practice to distinguish right from wrong.  Therefore, let us
leave behind the elementary teaching about the Christ and press on to
perfection, not always laying over again a foundation of repentance for
a lifeless formality, of faith in God -- teaching concerning baptisms
and the laying on of hands, the resurrection of the dead and a final
judgment. Yes and, with God's help, we will. For if those who were once
for all brought into the light, and learned to appreciate the gift from
heaven, and came to share in the Holy Spirit, and learned to appreciate
the beauty of the divine message, and the new powers of the coming age
-- if those, I say, fell away, it would be impossible to bring them
again to repentance; they would be crucifying the Son of God over again
for themselves, and exposing him to open contempt. Ground that drinks in
the showers that from time to time fall on it, and produces vegetation
useful to those for whom it is tilled, receives a blessing from God;
but, if it bears thorns and thistles, it is regarded as worthless, it is
in danger of being cursed, and its end will be the fire.
     But about you, dear friends, even though we speak in this way, we
are confident of better things -- of things that point to your
salvation. For God is not unjust; he will not forget the work that you
did, and the love that you showed for his name, in sending help to your
fellow Christians -- as you are still doing. But our great desire is
that every one of you should be equally earnest to attain to a full
conviction that our hope will be fulfilled, and that you should keep
that hope to the end. Then you will not show yourselves slow to learn,
but you will copy those who, through faith and patience, are now
entering upon the enjoyment of God's promises.
     When God gave his promise to Abraham, since there was no one
greater by whom he could swear, he swore by himself. His words were --

     "I will assuredly bless you and increase your numbers."
 And so, after patiently waiting, Abraham obtained the fulfilment of
God's promise. People, of course, swear by what is greater than
themselves, and with them an oath is accepted as putting a matter beyond
all dispute. And therefore God, in his desire to show, with unmistakable
plainness, to those who were to enter on the enjoyment of what he had
promised, the unchangeableness of his purpose, bound himself with an
oath. For he intended us to find great encouragement in these two
unchangeable things, which make it impossible for God to prove false --
we, I mean, who fled for safety where we might lay hold on the hope set
before us. This hope is an anchor for our souls, secure and strong, and
it reaches into the sanctuary that lies behind the curtain, where Jesus,
our forerunner, has entered on our behalf, after being made for all time
a high priest of the order of Melchizedek.

*Paramount Priesthood of the Christ*

     It was this Melchizedek, king of Salem and priest of the Most High
God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and gave
him his blessing; and it was to him that Abraham allotted a tithe of all
the spoil. The meaning of his name is "king of righteousness," and
besides that, he was also king of Salem, which means "king of peace."
There is no record of his father, or mother, or lineage, nor again of
any beginning of his days, or end of his life. In this he resembles the
Son of God, and stands before us as a priest whose priesthood is
continuous.
     Consider, then the importance of this Melchizedek, to whom even the
patriarch Abraham himself gave a tithe of the choicest spoils. Those
descendants of Levi, who are from time to time appointed to the
priesthood, are directed to collect tithes from the people in accordance
with the Law -- that is from their own kindred, although they also are
descended from Abraham. But Melchizedek, although not of this lineage,
received tithes from Abraham, and gave his blessing to the man who had
God's promises. Now no one can dispute that it is the superior who
blesses the inferior. In the one case the tithes are received by people
who are mortal; in the other case by one about whom there is the
statement that his life still continues. Moreover, in a sense, even
Levi, who is the receiver of the tithes, has, through Abraham, paid
tithes; for Levi was still in the body of his ancestor when Melchizedek
met Abraham.
     If, then, perfection had been attainable through the Levitical
priesthood -- and it was under this priesthood that the people received
the Law -- why was it still necessary that a priest of a different order
should appear, a priest of the order of Melchizedek and not of the order
of Aaron? With the change of the priesthood a change of the Law became a
necessity. And he of whom all this is said belonged to quite a different
tribe, no member of which has ever served at the altar. For it is plain
that our Lord had sprung from the tribe of Judah, though of that tribe
Moses said nothing about their being priests. All this becomes even yet
plainer when we remember that a new priest has appeared, resembling
Melchizedek, and that he was appointed, not under a Law regulating only
earthly matters, but by virtue of a life beyond the reach of death; for
that is the meaning of the declaration --

     "You are for all time a priest of the order of Melchizedek."
 On the one hand, we have the abolition of a previous regulation as
being both inefficient and useless (for the Law never brought anything
to perfection); and, on the other hand, we have the introduction of a
better hope, which enables us to draw near to God. Then again, the
appointment of this new priest was ratified by an oath, which is not so
with the Levitical priests, but his appointment was ratified by an oath,
when God said to him --

     "The Lord has sworn, and will not change, 'You are a priest for all
time.'"
 And the oath shows the corresponding superiority of the covenant of
which Jesus is appointed the surety. Again, new Levitical priests are
continually being appointed, because death prevents their remaining in
office; but Jesus remains for all time, and therefore the priesthood
that he holds will never pass to another. And that is why he is able to
save perfectly those who come to God through him, living for ever, as he
does, to intercede of their behalf.
     This was the high priest that we needed -- holy, innocent,
spotless, withdrawn from sinners, exalted above the highest heaven, one
who has no need to offer sacrifices daily as those high priests have,
first for their own sins, and then for those of the people. For this he
did once and for all, when he offered himself as the sacrifice. The Law
appoints as high priests men who are weak, but the words of God's oath,
which was later than the Law, name the Son as, for all time, the perfect
priest.
     To sum up what I have been saying: Such is the high priest that we
have, one who has taken his seat at the right hand of the throne of
God's Majesty in heaven, where he serves in the sanctuary, in that true
tent set up by the Lord and not by man. Every high priest is appointed
for the purpose of offering gifts and sacrifices to God; it follows,
therefore, that this high priest must have some offering to make. If he
were, however, still on earth, he would not even be a priest, since
there are already priests who offer the gifts as the Law directs. (These
priests, it is true, are engaged in a service which is only a copy and
shadow of the heavenly realities, as is shown by the directions given to
Moses when he was about to construct the tent. "Look to it," are the
words, "that you make every part in accordance with the pattern shown
you on the mountain.") But Jesus, as we see, has obtained a ministry as
far excelling theirs, as the covenant of which he is the intermediary,
based, as it is, on better promises, excels the former covenant. If that
first covenant had been faultless, there would have been no occasion for
a second. But, finding fault with the people, God says --

     "'A time is coming,' says the Lord,
         'When I will ratify a new covenant with the people of Israel
and with the people of Judah --
     Not such a covenant as I made with their ancestors
         on the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the
land of Egypt.
     For they did not abide by their covenant with me,
         and therefore I disregarded them,' says the Lord.
     'This is the covenant that I will make with the people of Israel
         after those days,' says the Lord.
     'I will impress my laws on their minds,
         and will inscribe them on their hearts;
     and I will be their God,
         and they will be my people.
     There will be no need for anyone to instruct their fellow citizen,
         or for a person to say to their relatives "Learn to know the
Lord";
     for everyone will know me,
         from the lowest to the highest.
     For I will be merciful to their wrongdoings,
         and I will no longer remember their sins.'"
 By speaking of a new covenant, God at once renders the former covenant
obsolete; and whatever becomes obsolete and loses its force is virtually
annulled.

*The New Revelation and the Old*

     It is true that even the first covenant had its regulations for
divine worship, and its sanctuary -- though only a material one. For a
tent was constructed, with an outer part which contained the stand for
the lamps, and the table, and the consecrated bread. This is called the
sanctuary. The part of the tent behind the second curtain is called the
inner sanctuary. In it is the gold incense-altar, and the ark containing
the covenant, completely covered with gold. In the ark is a gold casket
containing the manna, Aaron's rod that budded, and the tablets on which
the covenant was written; while above it, and overshadowing the cover on
which atonement was made, are the cherubim of the presence. Now is not
the time to discuss these things in detail. Such, then, was the
arrangement of the tent. Into the outer part priests are constantly
going, in the discharge of their sacred duties; but into the inner only
the high priest goes, and that but once a year, and never without taking
the blood of a victim, which he offers on his own behalf, and on behalf
of the errors of the people. By this the Holy Spirit is teaching that
the way into the sanctuary was hidden, as long as the outer part of the
tent still remained. For that was only a type, to continue down to the
present time; and, in keeping with it, both gifts and sacrifices are
offered, though incapable of satisfying the conscience of the worshiper;
the whole system being concerned only with food and drink and various
ablutions -- external ceremonials imposed until the coming of the new
order.
     But, when Christ came, he appeared as high priest of that better
system which was established; and he entered through that nobler and
more perfect tent, not made by human hands -- that is to say, not a part
of this present creation. Nor was it with the blood of goats and calves,
but with his own blood, that he entered, once and for all, into the
sanctuary, and obtained our eternal deliverance. For, if the blood of
goats and bulls, and the sprinkling of the ashes of a heifer, purify
those who have been defiled (as far as ceremonial purification goes),
how much more will the blood of the Christ, who, through his eternal
Spirit, offered himself up to God, as a victim without blemish, purify
our consciences from a lifeless formality, and fit us for the service of
the living God! And that is why he is the intermediary of a new
covenant; in order that, as a death has taken place to effect a
deliverance from the offences committed under the first covenant, those
who have received the call may obtain the eternal inheritance promised
to them. Whenever such a covenant as a will is in question, the death of
the testator must of necessity be alleged. For such a covenant takes
effect only on death, it does not come into force as long as the
testator is alive. This explains why even the first covenant was not
ratified without the shedding of blood. For, when every command had been
announced to all the people by Moses in accordance with the Law, he took
the blood of the calves and of the goats, with water, scarlet wool, and
a bunch of hyssop, and sprinkled even the book of the Law, as well as
all the people, saying, as he did so -- 'This is the blood that renders
valid the covenant which God has commanded to be made with you.' And in
the same way he also sprinkled with the blood the tent and all the
things that were used in public worship. Indeed, under the Law, almost
everything is purified with blood; and, unless blood is shed, no
forgiveness is to be obtained.
     While, then, it was necessary for the copies of the heavenly
realities to be purified by such means as these, the heavenly realities
themselves required better sacrifices. For it was not into a sanctuary
made by human hands, which merely foreshadowed the true one, that Christ
entered, but into heaven itself, so that he might now appear in the
presence of God on our behalf. Nor yet was it to offer himself may
times, as year after year the high priest entered the sanctuary with an
offering of blood -- but not his own blood; for then Christ would have
had to undergo death many times since the creation of the world. But
now, once and for all, at the close of the age, he has appeared, in
order to abolish sin by the sacrifice of himself. And, as it is ordained
for people to die but once (death being followed by judgment), so it is
with the Christ. He was offered up once and for all, to bear away the
sins of many; and the second time he will appear -- but without any
burden of sin -- to those who are waiting for him, to bring salvation.

     The Law, though able to foreshadow the better system which was
coming, never had its actual substance. Its priests, with those
sacrifices which they offer continuously year after year, can never make
those who come to worship perfect. Otherwise, would not the offering of
these sacrifices have been abandoned, as the worshipers, having been
once purified, would have had their consciences clear from sins? But, on
the contrary, these sacrifices recall their sins to mind year after
year. For the blood of bulls and goats is powerless to remove sins. That
is why, when he was coming into the world, the Christ declared --

     "Sacrifice and offering you do not desire, but you provide for me a
body;
         You take no pleasure in burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin.
     So I said, 'See, I have come' (as is written of me in the pages of
the book),
         'To do your will, God.'"
 First come the words -- "You do not desire, nor do you take pleasure
in, sacrifices, offerings, burnt offerings, and sacrifices for sin"
(offerings regularly made under the Law), and then there is added --
"See, I have come to do your will." The former sacrifices are set aside
to be replaced by the latter. And it is in the fulfilment of the will of
God that we have been purified by the sacrifice, once and for all, of
the body of Jesus Christ. Every other priest stands day after day at his
ministrations, and offers the same sacrifices over and over again --
sacrifices that can never take sins away. But, this priest, after he had
offered one sacrifice for sins, which should serve for all time, "took
his seat at the right hand of God," and has since then been waiting "for
his enemies to be put as a stool for his feet." By a single offering he
has made perfect for all time those who are being purified. We have also
the testimony of the Holy Spirit. For, after saying --

     "'This is the covenant that I will make with them
         after those days,' says the Lord;
     'I will impress my laws on their hearts,
         and will inscribe them on their minds,'"
 then we have --

     "And their sins and their iniquities I will no longer remember."
 And, when these are forgiven, there is no further need of an offering
for sin.

*Encouragement and Warning*

     Therefore, friends, since we may enter the sanctuary with
confidence, in virtue of the blood of Jesus, by the way which he
inaugurated for us -- a new and living way, a way through the sanctuary
curtain (that is, his human nature); and, since we have in him "a great
priest set over the house of God," let us draw near to God in all
sincerity of heart and in perfect faith, with our hearts purified by the
sprinkled blood from all consciousness of wrong, and with our bodies
washed with pure water. Let us maintain the confession of our hope
unshaken, for he who has given us his promise will not fail us. Let us
vie with one another in a rivalry of love and noble actions. And let us
not, as some do, cease to meet together; but, on the contrary, let us
encourage one another, and all the more, now that you see the day
drawing near. Remember, if we sin wilfully after we have gained a full
knowledge of the truth, there can be no further sacrifice for sin; there
is only a fearful anticipation of judgment, and a burning indignation
which will destroy all opponents. When someone disregarded the Law of
Moses, they were, on the evidence of two or three witnesses, put to
death without pity. How much worse then, think you, will be the
punishment deserved by those who have trampled underfoot the Son of God,
who have treated the blood that rendered the covenant valid -- the blood
by which they were purified -- as if it were not holy, and who have
outraged the Spirit of love? We know who it was that said --

     "It is for me to avenge, I will requite";

 and again --

     "The Lord will judge his people."
 It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.
     Call to mind those early days in which, after you had received the
light, you patiently underwent a long and painful conflict. Sometimes,
in consequence of the taunts and injuries heaped on you, you became a
public spectacle; and sometimes you suffered through having shown
yourselves to be the friends of people who were in the same position in
which you had been. For you not only sympathised with those who were in
prison, but you even took the confiscation of your possessions joyfully,
knowing, as you did, that you had in yourselves a greater possession and
a lasting one. Do not, therefore, abandon the confidence that you have
gained, for it has a great reward awaiting it. You still have need of
patient endurance, in order that, when you have done God's will, you may
obtain the fulfilment of his promise.

     "For there is indeed but a very little while
         before he who is coming will have come, without delay;
     and through faith the righteous will find life,
         but, if anyone draws back, my heart can find no pleasure in
them."
 But we do not belong to those who draw back, to their ruin, but to
those who have faith, to the saving of their souls.

*Heroes of Faith*

     Faith is the realisation of things hoped for -- the proof of things
not seen. And it was for faith that the people of old were renowned.
Faith enables us to perceive that the universe was created at the
bidding of God -- so that we know that what we see was not made out of
visible things. Faith made the sacrifice which Abel offered to God a
better sacrifice than Cain's, and won him renown as a righteous man, God
himself establishing his renown by accepting his gifts; and it is by the
example of his faith that Abel, though dead, still speaks. Faith led to
Enoch's removal from earth, so that he might not experience death. "He
could not be found because God had removed him." For, before his
removal, he was renowned as having pleased God; but without faith it is
impossible to please him, for he who comes to God must believe that God
exists, and that he rewards those who seek for him.
     It was faith that enabled Noah, after he had received the divine
warning about what could not then be foreseen, to build, in reverent
obedience, an ark in which to save his family. By his faith he condemned
the world, and became possessed of that righteousness which follows on
faith.
     It was faith that enabled Abraham to obey the call that he
received, and to set out for the place which he was afterwards to obtain
as his own; and he set out not knowing where he was going. It was faith
that made him go to live as an emigrant in the promised land -- as in a
strange country -- living there in tents with Isaac and Jacob, who
shared the promise with him. For he was looking for the city with the
sure foundations, whose architect and builder is God.
     Again, it was faith that enabled Sarah to conceive (though she was
past the age for childbearing), because she felt sure that he who had
given her the promise would not fail her. And so from one man -- and
that when his powers were dead -- there sprang a people as numerous "as
the stars in the heavens or the countless grains of sand on the shore."
     All these died sustained by faith. They did not obtain the promised
blessings, but they saw them from a distance and welcomed the sight, and
they acknowledged themselves to be only foreigners and strangers on the
earth. Those who speak like this show plainly that they are seeking
their homeland. If they had been thinking of the land that they had
left, they could have found opportunities to return. But no, they were
longing for a better, a heavenly, land! And therefore God was not
ashamed to be called their God; indeed he had already prepared them a
city. It was faith that enabled Abraham, when put to the test, to offer
Isaac as a sacrifice -- he who had received the promises offering up his
only son, of whom it had been said --

     "It is through Isaac that there will be descendants to bear your
name."
 For he argued that God was even able to raise a man from the dead --
and indeed, figuratively speaking, Abraham did receive Isaac back from
the dead. It was faith that enabled Isaac to bless Jacob and Esau, even
with regard to the future. Faith enabled Jacob, when dying, to give his
blessing to each of the sons of Joseph, and "to bow himself in worship
as he leant on the top of his staff." Faith caused Joseph, when his end
was near, to speak of the future migration of the Israelites, and to
give instructions with regard to his bones. Faith caused the parents of
Moses to hide the child for three months after his birth, for they saw
that he was a beautiful child; and they would not respect the king's
order. It was faith that caused Moses, when he was grown up, to refuse
the title of "son of a daughter of Pharaoh." He preferred sharing the
hardships of God's people to enjoying the short-lived pleasures of sin.
For he counted "the reproaches that are heaped on the Christ" of greater
value than the treasures of Egypt, looking forward, as he did, to the
reward awaiting him. Faith caused him to leave Egypt, though undaunted
by the king's anger, for he was strengthened in his endurance by the
vision of the invisible God. Faith led him to institute the Passover and
the sprinkling of the blood, so that the Destroyer might not touch the
eldest children of the Israelites. Faith enabled the people to cross the
Red Sea, as if it had been dry land, while the Egyptians, when they
attempted to do so, were drowned. Faith caused the walls of Jericho to
fall after being encircled for seven days. Faith saved Rahab, the
prostitute, from perishing with the unbelievers, after she had
entertained the spies with friendliness.
     Need I add anything more? Time would fail me if I attempted to
relate the stories of Gideon, Barak, Samson, and Jephthah, and those of
David, Samuel, and the prophets. By their faith they subdued kingdoms,
ruled righteously, gained the fulfilment of God's promises, shut the
mouths of lions, quelled the fury of the flames, escaped the edge of the
sword, found strength in the hour of weakness, displayed their prowess
in war, and routed hostile armies. Women received back their dead raised
to life. Some were tortured on the wheel, and refused release in order
that they might rise to a better life. Others had to face taunts and
blows, and even chains and imprisonment. They were stoned to death, they
were tortured, they were swan asunder, they were put to the sword; they
wandered about clothed in the skins of sheep or goats, destitute,
persecuted, ill-used -- people of whom the world was not worthy --
roaming in lonely places, and on the mountains, and in caves and holes
in the ground. Yet, though they all won renown by their faith, they did
not obtain the final fulfilment of God's promise; since God had in view
some better thing for us, so that they would only reach perfection
together with us.

     Seeing, therefore, that there is on every side of us such a throng
of witnesses, let us also lay aside everything that hinders us, and the
sin that clings about us, and run with patient endurance the race that
lies before us, our eyes fixed on Jesus, the leader and perfect example
of our faith, who, for the joy that lay before him, endured the cross,
heedless of its shame, and now "has taken his seat at the right hand" of
the throne of God. Weigh well the example of him who had to endure such
opposition from "people who were sinning against themselves," so that
you should not grow weary or faint-hearted. You have not yet, in your
struggle with sin, resisted to the death; and you have forgotten the
encouraging words which are addressed to you as God's children --

     "My child, think not lightly of the Lord's discipline,
         do not despond when he rebukes you;
     For it is him whom he loves that he disciplines,
         and he chastises every child whom he acknowledges."
 It is for your discipline that you have to endure all this. God is
dealing with you as his children. For where is there a child whom his
father does not discipline? If you are left without that discipline, in
which all children share, it shows that you are bastards, and not true
children. Further, when our earthly fathers disciplined us, we respected
them. Should we not, then, much rather yield submission to the Father of
souls, and live? Our fathers disciplined us for only a short time and as
seemed best to them; but God disciplines us for our true good, to enable
us to share his holiness. No discipline is pleasant at the time; on the
contrary, it is painful. But afterwards its fruit is seen in the
peacefulness of a righteous life which is the lot of those who have been
trained under it. Therefore "lift again the down-dropped hands and
straighten the weakened knees; make straight paths for your feet," so
that the lame limb may not be put out of joint, but rather be cured.

*Conclusion*

     Try earnestly to live at peace with everyone, and to attain to that
purity without which no one will see the Lord. Take care that no one
fails to use the loving help of God, "that no bitterness is allowed to
take root and spring up, and cause trouble," and so poison the whole
community. Take care that no one becomes immoral, or irreligious like
Esau, who sold his birthright for a single meal. For you know that even
afterwards, when he wished to claim his father's blessing, he was
rejected -- for he never found an opportunity to repair his error --
though he begged for the blessing with tears.
     It is not to tangible "flaming fire" that you have drawn near, nor
to "gloom, and darkness, and storm, and the blast of a trumpet, and an
audible voice." Those who heard that voice entreated that they might
hear no more, for they could not bear to think of the command -- "If
even an animal touches the mountain, it is to be stoned to death;" and
so fearful was the sight that Moses said -- "I tremble with fear." No,
but it is to Mount Zion that you have drawn near, the city of the living
God, the heavenly Jerusalem, to countless hosts of angels, to the festal
gathering and assemblage of God's firstborn whose names are enrolled in
heaven, to God the judge of all people, to the spirits of the righteous
who have attained perfection, to Jesus, the intermediary of a new
covenant, and to the sprinkled blood that tells of better things than
the blood of Abel. Beware how you refuse to hear him who is speaking.
For, if the Israelites did not escape punishment, when they refused to
listen to him who taught them on earth the divine will, far worse will
it be for us, if we turn away from him who is teaching us from heaven.
Then his voice shook the earth, but now his declaration is --

     "Still once more I will cause not only the earth to tremble, but
also the heavens."
 And those words "still once more" indicate the passing away of all that
is shaken -- that is, of all created things -- in order that only what
is unshaken may remain. Therefore, let us, who have received a kingdom
that cannot be shaken, be thankful, and so offer acceptable worship to
God, with awe and the deepest respect. For our God is "a consuming
fire."
     Let your love for the Lord's followers continue. Do not neglect to
show hospitality; for, through being hospitable, people have all
unawares entertained angels. Remember the prisoners, as if you were
their fellow prisoners, and the oppressed, not forgetting that you also
are still in the body. Let marriage be honoured by all and the married
life be pure; for God will judge those who are immoral and those who
commit adultery. Do not let your conduct be ruled by the love of money.
Be content with what you have, for God himself has said --

     "I will never forsake you, nor will I ever abandon you."
 Therefore we may say with confidence --

     "The Lord is my helper, I will not be afraid.
         What can mere people do to me?"
 Do not forget your leaders, who told you God's message. Recall the
close of their lives, and imitate their faith.
     Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today -- yes, and for ever!
Do not let yourselves be carried away by the various novel forms of
teaching. It is better to rely for spiritual strength on the divine
help, than on regulations regarding food; for those whose lives are
guided by such regulations have not found them of service. We are not
without an altar; but it is one at which those who still worship in the
tent have no right to eat. The bodies of those animals whose blood is
brought by the high priest into the sanctuary, as an offering for sin,
are burnt outside the camp. And so Jesus, also, to purify the people by
his own blood, suffered outside the gate. Therefore let us go out to him
"outside the camp," bearing the same reproaches as he; for here we have
no permanent city, but are looking for the city that is to be. Through
him let us offer, as our sacrifice, continual praise to God -- an
offering from lips that glorify his name. Never forget to do kindly acts
and to share what you have with others, for such sacrifices are
acceptable to God. Obey your leaders, and submit to their control, for
they are watching over your souls, since they will have to render an
account, so that they may do it with joy, and not in sorrow. That would
not be to your advantage.

     Pray for us, for we are sure that our consciences are clear, since
our wish is to be occupied with what is good. And I the more earnestly
ask for your prayers, so that I may be restored to you the sooner.
     May God, the source of all peace, who brought back from the dead
him who, "by virtue of the blood that rendered valid the unchangeable
covenant, is the great shepherd of God's Sheep," Jesus, our Lord -- may
God make you perfect in everything that is good, so that you may be able
to do his will. May he bring out in us all that is pleasing in his
sight, through Jesus Christ, to whom be all glory for ever and ever.
Amen.
     I beg you, friends, to bear with these words of advice. For I have
written only very briefly to you.
     You will be glad to hear that our friend, Timothy, has been set
free. If he comes here soon, we will visit you together.

     Give our greeting to all your leaders, and to all Christ's people.
Our friends from Italy send their greetings to you.

     May God bless you all.

                            THE LETTER FROM
                                 JAMES


*Greeting*

     James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, greets the
twelve tribes that are living abroad.

*Advice on Various Subjects*

     My friends, whatever trials you may face from time to time, always
regard them as a reason for rejoicing, knowing, as you do, that the
testing of your faith develops endurance. And let endurance do its work
perfectly, so that you may be altogether perfect, and in no respect
lacking.
     If any one of you lacks wisdom, they should ask wisdom from the God
who gives freely to everyone without reproach, and it will be given to
them. But they should ask with confidence, never doubting; for the
person who doubts is like a wave of the sea driven here and there at the
mercy of the wind -- Such a person must not expect that they will
receive anything from the Lord, vacillating as they are, irresolute at
every turn.
     Let a follower in humble circumstances be proud of their exalted
position, but a rich follower of their humiliation; for the rich will
pass away like a wild flower. As the sun rises, and the hot wind blows,
the plant withers, its flower fades, and all its beauty is gone. So is
it with the rich. In the midst of their pursuits they will wither away.
     Blessed is the person who remains firm under temptation, for, when
they have stood the test, they will receive the crown of life, which the
Lord has promised to those who love him. Let no one say, when they are
tempted, 'It is God who is tempting me!' For God, who cannot be tempted
to do wrong, does not himself tempt anyone. A man is in every case
tempted by their own passions -- allured and enticed by them. Then
passion conceives and gives birth to sin, and sin, on reaching maturity,
brings forth death. Do not be deceived, my dear friends. Every good
thing given us, and every perfect gift, is from above, and comes down to
us from the Father of the lights in the heavens, who is himself never
subject to change or to eclipse. Because he so willed, he gave us life,
through the message of the truth, so that we should be, as it were, a
kind of first fruits of his creation.

     Mark this, my dear friends -- Let everyone be quick to listen, slow
to speak, and slow to get angry; for human anger does not forward the
righteous purpose of God. Therefore, get rid of all filthiness and
whatever wickedness still remains, and in a humble spirit receive that
message which has been planted in your hearts and is able to save your
souls. Put that message into practice, and do not merely listen to it --
deceiving yourselves. For, when anyone listens to it and does not
practice it, they are like a person looking at their own face in a
mirror. They look at themselves, then go on their way, but the person
who looks carefully into the perfect Law, the Law of freedom, and
continues to do so, not listening to it and then forgetting it, but
putting it into practice -- that person will be blessed in what they do.
When a person appears to be religious, yet does not bridle their tongue,
but imposes on their own conscience, that person's religious observances
are valueless. That religious observance which is pure and spotless in
the eyes of God our Father is this -- to visit orphans and widows in
their trouble, and to keep oneself uncontaminated by the world.

*Warning on Various Subjects*

     My friends, are you really trying to combine faith in Jesus Christ,
our glorified Lord, with discrimination? Suppose a visitor should enter
your synagogue, with gold rings and in grand clothes, and suppose a poor
man should come in also, in shabby clothes, and you show more respect to
the visitor who is wearing grand clothes, and say -- 'There is a good
seat for you here,' but to the poor man -- 'You must stand; or sit down
there by my footstool,' Haven't you made distinctions among yourselves,
and used evil standards of judgement? Listen, my dear friends. Has not
God chosen those who are poor in the things of this world to be rich
through their faith, and to possess the kingdom which he has promised to
those who love him? But you -- you insult the poor man! Isn't it the
rich who oppress you? Isn't it they who drag you into law courts? Isn't
it they who malign that honourable name spoken over you at your baptism?
If you keep the royal law which runs -- "You must love your neighbour as
you love yourself," you are doing right; but, if you discriminate, you
commit a sin, and stand convicted by that same law of being offenders
against it. For a person who has laid the Law, as a whole, to heart, but
has failed in one particular, is accountable for breaking all its
provisions. He who said "You must not commit adultery" also said "You
must not murder." If, then, you commit murder but not adultery, you are
still an offender against the Law. Therefore, speak and act as people
who are to be judged by the "Law of freedom." For there will be justice
without mercy for the person who has not acted mercifully. Mercy
triumphs over Justice.
     My friends, what good is it if someone claims that they have faith,
but they do not prove it by actions? Can such faith save them? Suppose
some brother or sister should be in need of clothes and of daily bread,
and one of you says to them -- 'Go, and peace be with you; keep warm and
eat well!' and yet you do not actually give them the necessities of
life, what good would it be to them? In just the same way faith, if not
followed by actions, is, by itself, a lifeless thing. Someone, indeed,
may say -- 'You are a man of faith, and I am a man of action.'
     'Then show me your faith,' I reply, 'apart from any actions, and I
will show you my faith by my actions.' It is a part of your faith, is it
not, that there is one God? Good; yet even the demons have that faith,
and tremble at the thought. Now do you really want to understand, fool,
how it is that faith without actions leads to nothing? Look at our
ancestor, Abraham. Was he not justified by his actions after he had
offered his son, Isaac, on the altar? You see how, in his case, faith
and actions went together; that his faith was perfected as the result of
his actions; and that in this way the words of scripture came true --
'Abraham believed God, and that was regarded by God as righteousness,'
and 'He was called the friend of God.' You see, then, that a person is
justified by actions, and not by faith alone. Wasn't it the same with
the prostitute, Rahab? Was she not justified by her actions, after she
had welcomed the messengers and helped them escape by another road? Just
as a body is dead without a spirit, so faith is dead without actions.
     Not many of you should become teachers, my friends, because you
know that we who teach will be judged more strictly than others. We
often make mistakes, every one of us. Anyone who does not make mistakes
when speaking is indeed a perfect person, able to bridle their whole
body as well. When we put bits into horses' mouths to make them obey us,
we change their course the rest of their bodies. Again, think of ships.
Large as they are, and even when driven by fierce winds, they are guided
by a very small rudder and steered in whatever direction the man at the
helm may determine. So is it with the tongue. Small as it is, it is a
great boaster. Think how a tiny spark may set the largest forest ablaze!
And the tongue is like a spark. It is a world of unrighteousness among
the parts of our body. It contaminates the whole body; it sets the whole
course of our existence on fire, and is itself set on fire by the flames
of Gehenna. For while all kinds of animals, birds and reptiles and sea
creatures can be tamed and have been tamed by humans, no human being can
tame the tongue. It is a restless plague! It is charged with deadly
poison! With it we bless our Lord and Father, and with it we curse
people who are made "in God's likeness." From the very same mouth come
blessings and curses! My friends, it is not right that this should be
so. Does a spring give both good and bad water from the same source? Can
a fig tree, my friends, bear olives? Or a vine bear figs? No, nor can a
brackish well give good water.
     Who among you claims to be wise and intelligent? They should show
that their actions are the outcome of a good life lived in the humility
of true wisdom. But if you harbour bitter envy and a spirit of rivalry
in your hearts, do not boast or deny the truth. That is not the wisdom
which comes from above; no, it is earthly, animalistic, demonic. For
where envy and rivalry exist, there you will also find disorder and all
kinds of bad, worthless actions. But the wisdom from above is, before
everything else, pure; then peace-loving, gentle, open to conviction,
rich in compassion and good deeds, and free from partiality and
insincerity. Justice is the harvest peacemakers will reap from seeds
sown in a spirit of peace.

     What is the cause of the fighting and quarrelling that goes on
among you? Isn't it to be found in the desires which are always at war
within you? You crave, yet do not have, so you commit murder, so You
covet, yet cannot gain your end. You quarrel and fight. You do not have,
because you do not ask. You ask, yet do not receive, because you ask for
a wrong purpose -- to spend what you get on your pleasures. Unfaithful
people! Don't you know that to be friends with the world means to be at
enmity with God? Therefore whoever chooses to be friends with the world
makes himself an enemy to God. Do you suppose scripture means nothing
when it says, "Envy results from the longings of the spirit which God
has implanted within you?" But he gives us greater grace; and that is
why it says, --

     "God opposes the haughty,
         but gives grace to the humble."

 Therefore submit to God. Stand up to the devil, and he will flee from
you. Draw near to God, and he will draw near to you. Make your hands
clean, you sinners; and your hearts pure, you vacillators! Grieve,
mourn, and lament! Let your laughter be turned to mourning, and your
happiness to gloom! Humble yourselves before the Lord, and he will exalt
you. Do not disparage one another, friends. The person who disparages
others, or passes judgment on them, disparages the Law and passes
judgment on the Law. But, if you pass judgment on the Law, you are not
obeying it, but judging it. There is only one lawgiver and judge -- he
who has the power both to save and to destroy. So then who are you to
pass judgment on your neighbour?

     Listen to me, you who say "Today or tomorrow we will go to such and
such a town and spend a year there, doing business and making money,"
yet you do not know what your life will be like tomorrow! For you are
but a puff of smoke that appears for a little while and then vanishes.
Instead you should say "If the Lord wills, we will live and do this or
that." But as it is, you are boasting presumptuously! All such boasting
is wicked. The person, then, who knows what is right but fails to do it
-- that is sin in them.
     Listen to me, you rich people, weep and wail for the miseries that
are coming upon you! Your riches have wasted away, and your clothes have
become moth-eaten. Your gold and silver are rusted; and the rust on them
will be evidence against you, and will eat into your flesh. It was fire,
so to speak, that you stored up for yourselves in these last days.
Listen! The wages you have held back from the labourers who mowed your
fields are crying out against you, and the outcries of your harvesters
have reached the ears of the Lord of Hosts! You have lived on earth a
life of extravagance and luxury; you have indulged your fancies in a
time of bloodshed. You have condemned, you have murdered, the righteous
one! Must not God be opposed to you?

*Concluding Appeal*

     Be patient, then, friends, until the coming of the Lord. Even the
farmer has to wait for the precious fruit of the earth, watching over it
patiently, until it has had the spring and summer rains. And you must be
patient also, and not be discouraged; for the Lord's coming is near. Do
not make complaints against one another, friends, or judgment will be
passed on you. The judge is already standing at the door! Friends, as an
example of the patient endurance of suffering, take the prophets who
spoke in the name of the Lord. We count those who displayed such
endurance blessed! You have heard, too, of Job's endurance, and have
seen what the Lord's purpose was, for "the Lord is full of pity and
compassion."
     Above all things, my friends, never take an oath, either by heaven,
or by earth, or by anything else. Let your "Yes" suffice for yes, and
"No" for no, so that you may escape condemnation.
     If anyone of you is in trouble, they should pray; if anyone is
happy, they should sing hymns. If anyone of you is ill, they should send
for the church elders, and let them pray over them, anointing them with
oil in the name of the Lord. The prayer offered in faith will save the
person who is sick, and the Lord will raise them from their bed; and if
they have committed sins, they will be forgiven. Therefore, confess your
sins to one another and pray for one another, so that you may be cured.
Great is the power of a good person's fervent prayer. Elijah was only
human like ourselves, but, when he prayed fervently that it might not
rain, no rain fell on the land for three and a half years. And, when he
prayed again, the clouds brought rain, and the land bore crops. My
friends, should one of you be led astray from the truth, and someone
bring them back again, be sure that the person who brings a sinner back
from their mistaken ways will save that person's soul from death, and
will cover a multitude of sins.

                          PETER'S FIRST LETTER


*Introduction*

     To the people of God who are living abroad, dispersed throughout
Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Roman Asia, and Bithynia, and who were
chosen in accordance with the foreknowledge of God the Father, through
the consecration of the Spirit, to learn obedience, and to be purified
by the sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ, from Peter, an apostle
of Jesus Christ. May blessing and peace be yours in ever increasing
measure.

*The Christian's Hope of Salvation*

     Blessed is the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has, in
his great mercy, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,
given us the new life of undying hope, that promises an inheritance,
imperishable, stainless, unfading, which has been reserved for you in
heaven -- for you who, through faith, are being guarded by the power of
God, awaiting a salvation that is ready to be revealed in the last days.
At the thought of this you are full of exultation, though (if it has
been necessary) you have suffered for the moment somewhat from various
trials; that the genuineness of your faith -- a thing far more precious
than gold, which is perishable, yet has to be tested by fire -- may win
praise and glory and honour at the appearing of Jesus Christ. Though you
have never seen him, yet you love him; though you do not even now see
him, yet you believe in him, and exalt with a triumphant happiness too
great for words, as you receive the reward of your faith in the
salvation of your souls! It was this salvation that the prophets, who
spoke long ago of the blessing intended for you, sought, and strove to
comprehend; as they strove to discern what that time could be, to which
the Spirit of Christ within them was pointing, when foretelling the
sufferings that Christ would have to endure, and the glories that would
follow. And it was revealed to them that it was not for themselves, but
for you, that they were acting as Ministers of the truths which have now
been told to you, by those who, with the help of the Holy Spirit sent
from heaven, have brought you the good news -- truths into which even
angels long to look.

*The Christian's Character*

     Therefore concentrate your minds, with the strictest self-control,
and fix your hopes on the blessing that is coming for you at the
appearing of Jesus Christ. Be like obedient children; do not let your
lives be shaped by the passions which once swayed you in the days of
your ignorance, but in your whole life show yourselves to be holy, after
the pattern of the Holy One from whom you received your call. For
scripture says --

     "You will be holy, because I am holy."
 And since you call on him as "Father," who judges everyone impartially
by what he has done, let respectful awe be the spirit of your lives
during the time of your stay on earth. For you know that it was not by
perishable things, such as silver and gold, that you were ransomed from
the aimless way of living which was handed down to you from your
ancestors, but by precious blood, as it were of a lamb, unblemished and
spotless, the blood of Christ. Destined for this before the beginning of
the world, he has been revealed in these last days for your sakes, who,
through him, are faithful to God who raised him from the dead and gave
him honour, so that your faith and hope are now in God.
     Now that, by your obedience to the truth, you have purified your
lives, so that there is growing up among you a genuine affection, love
one another earnestly with all your hearts; since your new life has
come, not from perishable, but imperishable, seed, through the message
of the Everliving God. For --

     "All earthly life is but as grass,
         and all its splendour as the flower of grass.
     The grass fades,
         its flower falls,
             but the teaching of the Lord remains for ever."
 And that is the teaching of the good news which has been told to you.
Now that you have done with all malice, all deceitfulness, insincerity,
jealous feelings, and all backbiting, like newly born infants, crave
pure spiritual milk, so that you may be enabled by it to grow until you
attain salvation -- since "you have found by experience that the Lord is
kind." Come to him, then, as to a living stone, rejected, indeed, by
men, but in God's eyes choice and precious; and, as living stones, form
yourselves into a spiritual house, to be a consecrated priesthood, for
the offering of spiritual sacrifices that will be acceptable to God
through Jesus Christ. For there is a passage of scripture that runs --

     "See, I am placing in Zion a choice and precious cornerstone;
         and those who believe in him will have no cause for shame."
 It is to you, then, who believe in him that he is precious, but to
those who do not believe he is "a stone which, though rejected by the
builders, has now itself become the corner-stone," and "a stumbling-
block, and a rock which will prove a hindrance." They stumble because
they do not accept the message. This was the fate destined for them. But
you are "a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a consecrated nation,
God's own people," entrusted with the proclamation of the goodness of
him who called you out of darkness into his wonderful light. Once you
were "not a people," but now you are "God's people"; once you "had not
found mercy," but now you "have found mercy."

*Practical Appeals in view of the Dangers of the Times.*

     Dear friends, I beg you, as pilgrims and strangers on earth, to
refrain from indulging the cravings of your earthly nature, for they
make war on the soul. Let your daily life among the Gentiles be so
upright, that, whenever they malign you as evildoers, they may learn, as
they watch, from the uprightness of your conduct, to praise God "at the
time when he will visit them."
     Submit to all human institutions for the Lord's sake, alike to the
emperor as the supreme authority, and to governors as sent by him to
punish evildoers and to commend those who do right. For God's will is
this -- that you should silence the ignorance of foolish people by doing
what is right. Act as free people, yet not using your freedom as those
do who make it a cloak for wickedness, but as Servants of God. Show
honour to everyone, love the Lord's followers, "revere God, honour the
emperor."
     Those of you who are domestic servants should always be submissive
and respectful to their masters, not only to those who are good and
considerate, but also to those who are arbitrary. For this wins God's
approval when, because conscious of God's presence, a person who is
suffering unjustly bears their troubles patiently. What credit can you
claim when, after doing wrong, you take your punishment for it
patiently? But, on the other hand, if, after doing right, you take your
sufferings patiently, that does win the approval of God. For it was to
this that you were called! For Christ, too, suffered -- on your behalf
-- and left you an example, that you should follow in his steps. He
"never sinned, nor was anything deceitful ever heard from his lips." He
was abused, but he did not answer with abuse; he suffered, but he did
not threaten; he entrusted himself to him whose judgments are just. And
he "himself carried our sins" in his own body to the cross, so that we
might die to our sins, and live for righteousness. "His bruising was
your healing." Once you were straying like sheep, but now you have
returned to the shepherd and guardian of your souls.
     Again, you married women should submit to your husbands, so that if
any of them reject the message, they may, apart from the message, be won
over, by the conduct of their wives, as they see your pure, reverent
conduct. Yours should be, not the external adornment of the arrangement
of the hair, the wearing of jewellery, or the putting on of dresses, but
the inner life with the imperishable beauty of a quiet and gentle
spirit; for this is very precious in God's sight. It was by this that
the holy women of old, who rested their hopes on God, adorned
themselves; submitting to their husbands, as Sarah did, who obeyed
Abraham, and called him master. And you are her true children, as long
as you live good lives, and let nothing terrify you.
     Again, those of you who are married men should live considerately
with their wives, showing due regard to their sex, as physically weaker
than their own, and not forgetting that they share with you in the gift
of life. Then you will be able to pray without hindrance.
     Lastly, you should all be united, sympathetic, full of love for
each other, kind-hearted, humble-minded; never returning evil for evil,
or abuse for abuse, but, on the contrary, blessing. It was to this that
you were called -- to obtain a blessing!

     "The person who wants to enjoy life
         and see happy days --
     they should keep their tongue from evil
         and their lips from deceitful words,
     they should turn from evil and do good,
         They should seek for peace and follow after it;
     For the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous,
         and his ears are attentive to their prayers,
             but the face of the Lord is set against those who do
wrong."

     Who, indeed, is there to harm you, if you prove yourselves to be
eager for what is good? Even if you should suffer for righteousness,
count yourselves blessed! "Do not let people terrify you, or allow
yourselves to be dismayed." Revere the Christ as Lord in your hearts;
always ready to give an answer to anyone who asks your reason for the
hope that you cherish, but giving it with courtesy and respect, and
keeping your consciences clear, so that, whenever you are maligned,
those who vilify your good and Christian conduct may be put to shame. It
is better that you should suffer, if that should be God's will, for
doing right, than for doing wrong. For Christ himself died to atone for
sins once for all -- the good on behalf of the bad -- that he might
bring you to God; his body being put to death, but his spirit entering
on new life. And it was then that he went and preached to the imprisoned
spirits, who once were disobedient, at the time when God patiently
waited, in the days of Noah, while the ark was being prepared; in which
some few lives, eight in all, were saved by means of water. And baptism,
which this foreshadowed, now saves you -- not the mere cleansing of the
body, but the search of a clear conscience after God -- through the
resurrection of Jesus Christ, who has gone into heaven, and is at God's
right hand, where angels and archangels and the powers of heaven now
yield submission to him.
     Since, then, Christ suffered in body, arm yourselves with the same
resolve as he; for he who has suffered in body has ceased to sin, and so
will live the rest of his earthly life guided, not by human passions,
but by the will of God. Surely in the past you have spent time enough
living as the Gentiles delight to live. For your path has lain among
scenes of debauchery, licentiousness, drunkenness, revelry, hard-
drinking, and profane idolatry. And, because you do not run to the same
extremes of profligacy as others, they are astonished, and malign you.
But they will have to answer for their conduct to him who is ready to
judge both the living and the dead. For that was why the good news was
told to the dead also -- that, after they have been judged in the body,
as people are judged, they might live in the spirit, as God lives.

     But the end of all things is near. Therefore exercise self-
restraint and be calm, so that you may be able to pray. Above all
things, let your love for one another be earnest, for "Love throws a
veil over countless sins." Never grudge hospitality to one another.
Whatever the gift that each has received, use it in the service of
others, as good stewards of the varied bounty of God. When anyone
speaks, they should speak as one who is delivering the oracles of God.
When anyone is endeavouring to serve others, they should do so in
reliance on the strength which God supplies; so that in everything God
may be honoured through Jesus Christ -- to whom be ascribed all honour
and might for ever and ever. Amen.

     Dear friends, do not be astonished at the trial of fire that you
are passing through, to test you, as though something strange were
happening to you. No, the more you share the sufferings of the Christ,
the more may you rejoice, that, when the time comes for the
manifestation of his glory, you may rejoice and exult. If you are
insulted for bearing the name of Christ, count yourselves blessed;
because the divine glory and the Spirit of God are resting on you. I
need hardly say that no one among you must suffer as a murderer, or a
thief, or a criminal, or for interfering in matters which do not concern
Christians. But, if someone suffers as a Christian, they should not be
ashamed of it; they should bring honour to God even though they bear
that name. For the time has come for judgment to begin with the house of
God; and, if it begins with us, what will be the end of those who reject
God's good news? If "a good person is saved only with difficulty, what
will become of the godless and the sinful?" Therefore, I say, let those
who suffer, because God wills it so, commit their lives into the hands
of a faithful Creator, and persevere in doing right.

*Conclusion*

     As for the older ones among you, who are elders in the church, I,
their fellow elder, and a witness to the sufferings of the Christ, who
will also share in the glory that is to be revealed -- I beg you to be
true shepherds of the flock of God among you, not because you are
compelled, but of your own free will; not from a base love of gain, but
with a ready spirit; not as lords of your charges, but as examples to
your flock. Then, when the chief shepherd appears, you will win the
crown of glory that never fades. Again, you younger ones should show
deference to the older. And all of you should put on the badge of
humility in mutual service, for "God is opposed to the proud, but gives
his help to the humble."

     Humble yourselves, therefore, under the mighty hand of God, so that
he may exalt you in his good time, laying all your anxieties on him, for
he makes you his care. Exercise self-control, be watchful. Your
adversary, the devil, like a roaring lion, is prowling about, eager to
devour you. Stand firm against him, strong in your faith; knowing, as
you do, that the sufferings which you are undergoing are being endured
to the full by the Lord's followers throughout the world. God, from whom
all help comes, and who called you, by your union with Christ, into his
eternal glory, will, when you have suffered for a little while, himself
perfect, establish, strengthen you. To him be ascribed dominion for
ever. Amen.

     I have been writing to you briefly by the hand of Silas, our true-
hearted friend (for so I regard him), to encourage you, and to bear my
testimony that in what I have written is to be found the true love of
God. On that take your stand. Your sister church in "Babylon" sends you
greeting, and so does Mark, who is as a son to me. Greet one another
with the kiss of love.

    May God give his peace to you all in your union with Christ.

                         PETER'S SECOND LETTER


*Introduction*

     To those to whom, through the justice of our God and Saviour Jesus
Christ, there has been granted faith equally privileged with our own,
from Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ.

     May blessing and peace be yours in ever increasing measure, as you
advance in the knowledge of God and of Jesus, our Lord. For his divine
power has given us everything that is needful for a life of piety, as we
advance in the knowledge of him who called us by a glorious
manifestation of his goodness. For it was through this that he gave us
what we prize as the greatest of his promises, that through them you
might participate in the divine nature, now that you have fled from the
corruption in the world, resulting from human passions. Yes, and for
this reason do your best to supplement your faith by goodness, goodness
by knowledge, knowledge by self-control, self-control by endurance,
endurance by piety, piety by mutual affection, and mutual affection by
love. For, when these virtues are yours, in increasing measure, they
prevent your being indifferent to, or destitute of, a fuller knowledge
of our Lord Jesus Christ. Surely the person who has not these virtues is
shortsighted even to blindness, and has chosen to forget that they have
been purified from their sins of the past! Therefore, friends, do your
best to put God's call and selection of you beyond all doubt; for, if
you do this, you will never fall. For in this way you will be given a
triumphant admission into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Saviour,
Jesus Christ.

*The Transfiguration and the "Second Coming" of the Christ*

     I will, therefore, always be ready to remind you of all this, even
though you know it and are firmly established in the truth that you now
hold. But I think it my duty, as long as I live in this "tent," to rouse
you by awakening memories of the past; for I know that the time for this
"tent" of mine to be put away is soon coming, as our Lord Jesus Christ
himself assured me. So I will do my best to enable you, at any time
after my departure, to call these truths to mind. For we were not
following cleverly devised stories when we told you of the coming in
power of our Lord Jesus Christ, but we had been eye-witnesses of his
majesty. For he received honour and glory from God the Father, when from
the glory of the Divine Majesty there were borne to his ears words such
as these -- "This is my dearly loved son, who brings me great joy."
These were the words that we heard, borne to our ears from heaven, when
we were with him on that sacred mountain. And still stronger is the
assurance that we have in the teaching of the prophets; to which you
will do well to pay attention (as if it were a lamp shining in a gloomy
place), until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts.
But first be assured of this: There is no prophetic teaching found in
scripture that can be interpreted by a person's unaided reason; for no
prophetic teaching ever came in the old days at the mere wish of people,
but people, moved by the Holy Spirit, spoke direct from God.

*Warning against separating Christianity from a Holy Life*

     But there were false prophets also in the nation, just as there
will be false teachers among you, people who will secretly introduce
ruinous divisions, disowning even the Lord who bought them, and bringing
speedy ruin on themselves. There will be many, too, who will follow
their licentious courses, and cause the way of the truth to be maligned.
In their covetousness they will try to make you a source of profit by
their fabrications; but for a long time past their sentence has not been
standing idle, nor their ruin slumbering. Remember, God did not spare
angels when they sinned, but sent them down to Tartarus, and consigned
them to caverns of darkness, to be kept under guard for judgment. Nor
did he spare the world of old; though he preserved Noah, the preacher of
righteousness, and seven others, when he brought a flood on the godless
world. He condemned the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah and reduced them to
ashes, holding them up as a warning to the godless of what was in store
for them; but he rescued righteous Lot, whose heart was vexed by the
wanton licentiousness of his neighbours; for, seeing and hearing what he
did, as he lived his righteous life among them, day after day, Lot's
righteous soul was tortured by their wicked doings. The Lord, therefore,
knows how to deliver the pious from temptation, and to keep the wicked,
who are even now suffering punishment, in readiness for "the day of
judgment" -- especially those who, following the promptings of their
lower nature, indulge their polluting passions and despise all control.
Audacious and self-willed, they feel no awe of the celestial beings,
maligning them, even where angels, though excelling them in strength and
power, do not bring against them a malignant charge before the Lord.
These people, however, like animals without reason, intended by nature
to be caught and killed -- these people, I say, malign those of whom
they know nothing, and will assuredly perish through their own
corruption, suffering themselves, as the penalty for the suffering that
they have inflicted. They think that pleasure consists in the self-
indulgence of the moment. They are a stain and a disgrace, indulging, as
they do, in their wanton revelry, even while joining you at your feasts.
They have eyes only for adulteresses, eyes never tired of sin; they
entice weak souls; their minds are trained to covet; they live under a
curse. Leaving the straight road, they have gone astray and followed in
the steps of Balaam, the son of Beor, who set his heart on the reward
for wrongdoing, but was rebuked for his offence. A dumb animal spoke
with a human voice, and checked the prophet's madness. These people are
like springs without water, or mists driven before a gale; and for them
the blackest darkness has been reserved. With boastful and foolish talk,
they appeal to the passions of people's lower nature, and, by their
profligacy, entice those who are just escaping from the people who live
such misguided lives. They promise them freedom, while they themselves
are slaves to corrupt habits; for a person is the slave of anything to
which they give way. If, after having escaped the polluting influences
of the world, through knowing our Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ, people
are again entangled in them, and give way to them, their last state has
become worse than their first. It would, indeed, have been better for
them not to have known the way of righteousness, than, after knowing it,
to turn away from the holy command delivered to them. In their case is
seen the truth of the proverb -- "A dog returns to what it has vomited"
and "A sow after washing to her wallowing-place in the mud."

*A Reassertion of the "Second Coming" of the Christ*

     This, dear friends, is my second letter to you. In both of them I
have tried, by appealing to your remembrance, to arouse your better
feelings. I want you to recall what was foretold by the holy prophets,
as well as the command of our Lord and Saviour given to you through your
apostles. First be assured of this, that, as the age draws to an end,
scoffers, led by their own passions, will come and ask scoffingly --
"Where is his promised coming? Ever since our ancestors passed to their
rest, everything remains just as it was when the world was first
created!" For they wilfully shut their eyes to the fact that long ago
the heavens existed; and the earth, also -- formed out of water and by
the action of water, by the fiat of God; and that by the same means the
world which then existed was destroyed in a deluge of water. But the
present heavens and earth, by the same fiat, have been reserved for
fire, and are being kept for the day of the judgment and destruction of
the godless.
     But you, dear friends, must never shut your eyes to the fact that,
to the Lord, one day is the same as a thousand years, and a thousand
years as one day. The Lord is not slow to fulfil his promise, as some
count slowness; but he is forbearing with you, as it is not his will
that any of you should perish, but that all should be brought to
repentance. The day of the Lord will come like a thief; and on that day
the heavens will pass away with a crash, the elements will be burnt up
and dissolved, and the earth and all that is in it will be disclosed.
Now, since all these things are in the process of dissolution, think
what you yourselves ought to be -- what holy and pious lives you ought
to lead, while you wait for the coming of the day of God and strive to
make it come soon{  (3:12)  Or: and desire its coming. }. At its coming
the heavens will be dissolved in fire, and the elements melted by heat,
but we look for new heavens and a new earth, where righteousness will
have its home, in fulfilment of the promise of God.
     Therefore, dear friends, in expectation of these things, make every
effort to be found by him spotless, blameless, and at peace. Regard our
Lord's forbearance as your one hope of salvation. This is what our dear
friend Paul wrote to you, with the wisdom that God gave him. It is the
same in all his letters, when he speaks in them about these subjects.
There are some things in them difficult to understand, which untaught
and weak people distort, just as they do all other writings, to their
own ruin. You must, therefore, dear friends, now that you know this
beforehand, be on your guard against being led away by the errors of
reckless people, and so lapsing from your present steadfastness; and
advance in the love and knowledge of our Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ.
All glory be to him now and for ever.

                          JOHN'S FIRST LETTER


*Preface*

     We write to you about the Word of life, which has been in existence
from the beginning. We write of what we have heard, of what we have seen
with our eyes, of what we watched reverently and touched with our hands.
That life was made visible, and we have seen it. We bear our testimony
to it, and tell you of that eternal life which was with the Father and
was made visible to us. It is of what we have seen and heard that we now
tell you, so that you may have fellowship with us. And our fellowship is
with the Father and with his Son, Jesus Christ. We are writing all this
to you that our joy may be complete.

*Fellowship with God*

     This is the message which we have heard from him and announce to
you: God is light, and there is no darkness in him at all. If we say
that we have fellowship with him and yet continue to walk in the
darkness, our words and our lives are a lie. But if we walk in the
light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and
the blood of Jesus, his Son, cleanses us from all sin. If we say, 'we
have no sin,' then we are deceiving ourselves, and the truth is not in
us. If we confess our sins, he is just and may be trusted to forgive our
sins and cleanse us from all wrongdoing. If we say that we haven't
sinned, we make God a liar, and his Word is not in us.
     My children, I am writing to you to keep you from sinning. But if
anyone does sin, we have an advocate with the Father -- Jesus Christ,
the righteous. He is the atoning sacrifice for our sins, and not for
ours only, but the sins of the whole world. It is by keeping God's
commands that we can be sure we know him. Whoever says 'I know him,' but
does not keep his commands, is a liar. The truth has no place in them.
But the person who keeps God's word, in them the love of God has indeed
reached its perfection. This is how we can be sure we are in him:
whoever claims to live in him should live just as Jesus did.

*A new commandment*

     Dear friends, it is no new command that I am writing to you, but an
old command, which you have had from the beginning. That old command is
the message you have already heard. Yet, in a way, it is a new command
that I am writing to you -- which is shown true in Christ's life and in
yours -- for the darkness is passing away and the true light is already
shining. The person who says that they are in the light, and yet hates
others, is still in the darkness. The person who loves others is always
in the light, and there is nothing within them to cause them to stumble.
The person who hates is in the dark. They stumble along in the darkness;
they do not know where they are going because the darkness blinds them.

*Those who know God should not love the world*



     Little children, I am writing to you
         because your sins have been forgiven for Christ's sake.
     Parents, I am writing to you
         because you have come to know him who has been from the
beginning.
     Young people, I am writing to you
         because you have conquered the evil one.
     Children, I write to you
         because you have come to know the Father.
     Parents, I write to you
         because you have learned to know him who has been from the
beginning.
     Young people, I write to you
         because you are strong,
         and God's message is always in your hearts,
         and you have conquered the evil one.
     Do not love the world or what the world can offer. When anyone
loves the world, there is no love for the Father in them. For all that
the world can offer -- the desires for physical pleasure, the
enticements to the eye, the arrogance of wealth -- belongs, not to the
Father, but to the world. And the world, and all that it gratifies, is
passing away, but they who do God's will remain for ever.

*Warnings against an antichrist*

     My children, it is the last hour. You were told that an antichrist
was coming; and many antichrists have already arisen. This is why we
know that this is the last hour. These people come from our ranks, but
they were never truly part of us -- if they had been then they would
have stayed with us. They left so it would be clear that none of them
really belonged to us. You, however, have been annointed by the Holy
One. You all know the truth. I am not writing to you because you do not
know the truth, but because you do know it, and because no lie can come
from the truth.
     Who is a liar, if not the one who denies that Jesus is the Christ?
That person is the antichrist -- one who rejects the Father and the Son.
No one who rejects the Son has the Father; to acknowledge the Son is to
have the Father also. As for you, you must let what you have heard from
the beginning continue to live in you. If what you heard from the
beginning dwells in you, you will remain both in the Son and the Father.
And this is what he himself promised us -- eternal life!
     In writing this to you, I have in mind those who are trying to
mislead you. As for you, the anointing which you received from him
remains with you. You do not need anyone to teach you. His anointing
teaches you about everything. What it teaches you is true, it is not a
lie. Do what it has taught you: abide in him. Yes, my children, remain
in him, so that when he appears our confidence doesn't fail us, and we
are not ashamed to meet him at his coming. Since you know he is
righteous, you realise that everyone who does what is right is his
child.

*God's Children*

     See what great love the Father has lavished on us: he lets us be
called God's children! For that is what we are. The reason why the world
does not know us is that it has not learned to know him. Dear friends,
we are God's children now, and what we will be has not yet been
revealed. What we do know is that, when it is revealed, we will be like
him, because we will see him as he is. And just as he is pure, everyone
who has this hope, makes and keeps themselves pure.
     Everyone who lives sinfully is living in violation of God's law.
Sin is lawlessness. You know that Christ appeared to take away our sins
and that there is no sin in him. No one who lives in him continues to
sin; the sinner has not seen or known him. My children, don't let anyone
mislead you. The person who does what is right is righteous, just as
Christ is righteous. The person who lives in sin is a child of the
devil, for the devil has been sinning from the beginning. To undo the
devil's work is the reason the Son of God appeared.
     No child of God sins, because God's nature dwells in them. They
can't live in sin, because they are God's children. By this it is made
clear who are the children of God and who are the devil's: anyone who
doesn't do what is right or doesn't love others is not a child of God.
For this is the message we heard from the beginning: we are to love one
another. We must not be like Cain, who belonged to the evil one and
murdered his brother. Why did he kill him? Because his actions were
evil, and his brother's were righteous.

*Love each other*

     Do not be suprised, friends, if the world hates you. We know that
we have passed out of death into life, because we love each other. The
person who does not love remains in a state of death. The person who
hates another is a murderer, and you know that no murderer has eternal
life dwelling within them.
     This is how we know what love is: Christ gave his life for us. So
we should lay down our own lives for each other. If anyone has material
possessions, and sees one of our own in need, but closes their heart
against that person, how can it be said that the love of God is within
them? My children, our love must not be mere words or talk. It must be
true and show itself in actions.
     This is how we will know we belong to the truth and reassure
ourselves in God's presence: though our conscience condemns us, God is
greater than our conscience and knows everything. Dear friends, if our
conscience does not condemn us, then we approach God with confidence,
and we receive from him whatever we ask, because we are keeping his
commands, and are doing what pleases him. His command is that we should
believe in his Son, Jesus Christ, and love one another, as Christ
commanded us. The person who keeps his commands dwells in God and God
dwells in them. And we are sure he lives in us because of the Spirit he
has given us.

*True and False Inspiration*

     Dear friends, do not trust every spirit, but test the spirits to
see whether they are from God, because many false prophets have gone out
into the world.
     This is the way to recognise the Spirit of God: those who
acknowledge Jesus Christ as come in the flesh have God's Spirit, while a
spirit that doesn't acknowledge Jesus isn't from God. Instead it is the
spirit of the antichrist; you have heard that it was coming, and it is
now already in the world!
     You, my children, come from God, and you have successfully resisted
such people as these, because he who is in you is greater than the one
who is in the world. Those people belong to the world and therefore they
speak as the world speaks, and the world listens to them. We come from
God. Whoever knows God listens to us; the person who does not come from
God does not listen to us. This is how we distinguish the spirit of
truth and the spirit of deception.

*God is love*

     Dear friends, let us love one another, because love comes from God
and everyone who loves is a child of God and knows God. Those who do not
love know nothing of God, for God is love. This is how God showed his
love among us: he sent his one and only Son into the world that we might
live through him. This is what love is: it is not that we have loved
God, but that he loved us and sent his Son to be an atoning sacrifice
for our sins.
     Dear friends, since God loved us in this way, we should love one
another. No one has ever seen God, but if we love one another, God lives
in us and his love reaches perfection within us. We know that we live in
him, and he lives in us, because he has given us a measure of his
Spirit. Moreover, we have seen for ourselves and testify that the Father
has sent the Son to be the Saviour of the world. Whoever acknowledges
that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, God lives in them, and they live in
God. And so we have come to know and believe the love which God has for
us.
    God is love; and whoever lives in love lives in God, and God lives
in them. This is the way love has reached its perfection among us, so
that we may have confidence on the day of judgment, because in this
world we are like Christ. There is no fear in love; perfect love drives
out fear because fear has to do with punishment. So anyone who is afraid
has not reached perfection in love. We love, because God first loved us.
If someone says "I love God," and yet hates others, they are a liar. For
the person who does not love their brother or sister, whom they have
seen, cannot love God, whom they have not seen. Indeed, we have this
command from Christ: Those who love God must also love each other.

*Faith and Confidence*

     Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ is a child of God,
and everyone who loves a parent loves his child. By this we know that we
love God's children -- when we love God and carry out his commands. For
to love God is to do what he commands and his commands are not a burden,
for whatever is born of God overcomes the world. What is the victory by
which the world is overcome? Our faith! Who can overcome the world but
the person who believes that Jesus is the Son of God? Jesus Christ, the
one who came by water and blood -- not by water only but by water and
blood -- and the Spirit testifies to this because the Spirit is truth.
Indeed three testify: the Spirit, the water, and the blood, and these
three agree. We accept human testimony, surely God's testimony is even
stronger! And God's testimony is the testimony he has given about his
Son. The person who believes in the Son of God has that testimony within
them. The person who does not believe God has made God a liar, by not
believing the testimony God has given about his Son. And this is that
testimony: God gave us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.
Whoever has the Son has life; whoever who doesn't have God's Son does
not have life.

*Final words*

     I have written these things to you who believe in the name of God's
Son, so that you may know that you have eternal life. We can approach
him with this confidence, that whenever we ask anything that is in
accordance with his will, he listens to us. And if we know he hears us
-- whatever we ask -- we know also that what we ask for is ours. If
anyone sees one of our people committing some sin that is not a sin
leading to death, they should ask, and God will give them life. I refer
to those whose sin does not lead to death. There is a sin that leads to
death. I am not saying that you should pray about that. All wrongdoing
is sin, but there is sin that does not lead to death.
     We know that those who have been born of God do not keep sinning.
God protects his children and the evil one cannot get hold of them. We
know that we are God's children, though the whole world lies in the
power of the evil one. We also know that the Son of God has come and has
given us understanding, so that we may know the true God -- and we are
in him who is true, by being in his Son Jesus Christ. He is the true God
and eternal life. My children, guard yourselves against false ideas of
God.

                          JOHN'S SECOND LETTER


*Greetings*

     From the elder, to the lady chosen by God and her children. I truly
love you all, and I am not the only one but all who know the truth love
you as well. We love you for the sake of the truth, which lives in us
and will be with us forever.
     Grace, mercy, and peace will be ours -- the gift of God, the
Father, and of Jesus Christ, the Father's Son -- in truth and love.

*Live in truth and love*

     It was a great joy to me to find the lives of some of your children
guided by the truth, in obedience to the command that we received from
the Father. And now I implore you, dear lady, let us love one another
This is not a new command I am writing to you. It is the command we have
had from the beginning. -- Let us love one another. And this is love --
to live in obedience to the Father's commands. This is the command as
you learned from the beginning, to live a life of love. I say this
because many deceivers have gone out into the world -- men who do not
acknowledge that Jesus Christ came in flesh and blood. Any such person
is a deceiver and antichrist. Take care so that you do not what we have
worked for but instead receive your full reward. Anyone who goes beyond
and fails to live inside of the teaching of Christ does not have God.
The person who lives inside that teaching -- they have both the Father
and the Son. If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do
not receive them into your house or even welcome them; because the
person who welcomes them is sharing with them in his evil work.

*Final words*

     Though I have many other things to tell you, I would rather not use
paper and ink. Instead I hope to come and see you, and to speak with you
face to face, so that our joy may be complete. The children of your
sister, who is chosen by God, send you their greetings.

                          JOHN'S THIRD LETTER


*Greetings*

     From the elder to his dear friend Gaius, whom he sincerely loves.
     Dear friend, I pray that all may be well with you and that you may
have good health -- I know that all is well with your soul. For it was a
great joy to me, when some followers of the Lord came and testified to
your fidelity to the truth. I know that your own life is guided by the
truth. Nothing gives me greater pleasure than to hear from time to time
that the lives of my children are guided by the truth.

*Gaius*

     Dear friend, you are faithful in all the things you do for other
followers -- even when they are strangers to you. They themselves have
testified before the church to your love. You will do well to help them
on their way in a manner worthy of the service of God. For it was on
behalf of Christ's name that they set out, not accepting even one thing
from the Gentiles. Therefore, we should support people like them, and so
take our share in their work for the truth.

*Diotrephes and Demetrius*

     I wrote something to the church, but Diotrephes (who loves to be
the leader among them) doesn't welcome us. So if I come, I will bring up
his actions in telling wicked nonsense about us. Not content with that,
he not only refuses to personally welcome our friends who are followers,
but actually stops those who would, and expels them from the church.
     Dear friend, do not follow a bad example, but a good one. The
person who does what is good is from God; the person who does what is
bad has never seen God. Everyone has always had a good word for
Demetrius, and the truth itself speaks for him. Yes, and we also add our
good word, and you know that what we say is true.

*Final words*

     I have many things to tell you, but I would rather not use pen and
ink. I hope to see you soon, and then we will speak face to face. Peace
be with you. The friends here send you their greetings. Greet each one
of our friends.

                            THE LETTER FROM
                                  JUDE


*Introduction*

     To those who, having received the call, have been loved by God the
Father and protected by Jesus Christ, From Jude, a servant of Jesus
Christ, and the brother of James. May mercy, peace, and love be yours in
ever increasing measure.

*Warnings against moral corruption*

     Dear friends, while I was making every effort to write to you about
our common salvation, I felt that I must write to you at once to
encourage you to fight in defence of the faith that has once for all
been entrusted to the keeping of Christ's people. For there have crept
in among you certain godless people, whose sentence has long since been
pronounced, and who make the mercy of God an excuse for profligacy, and
disown our only lord and master, Jesus Christ.
     Now I want to remind you -- but you already know it all -- that,
though the Lord delivered the people from Egypt, yet he afterwards
destroyed those who refused to believe in him; and that even those
angels, who did not keep to their appointed spheres, but left their
proper homes, have been kept by him for the judgment of the great day in
everlasting chains and black darkness. Like Sodom and Gomorrah and the
towns near them, which gave themselves up to fornication, and fell into
unnatural vice, these angels now stand out as a warning, undergoing, as
they are, punishment in eternal fire.
     Yet in the same way these people, too, cherishing vain dreams,
pollute our human nature, reject control, and malign the celestial
beings. Yet even Michael, the archangel, when, in his dispute with the
devil, he was arguing about the body of Moses, did not venture to charge
him with maligning, but said merely "The Lord rebuke you!" But these
people malign whatever they do not understand; while they use such
things as they know by instinct (like the animals that have no reason)
for their own corruption. Alas for them! They walk in the steps of Cain;
led astray by Balaam's love of gain, they plunge into sin, and meet
their ruin through rebellion like Korah. These are the people who are
blots on your "love-feasts," when they feast together and provide
without scruple for themselves alone. They are clouds without rain,
driven before the winds; they are leafless trees without a vestige of
fruit, dead through and through, torn up by the roots; they are wild sea
waves, foaming with their own shame; they are "wandering stars," for
which the blackest darkness has been reserved for ever.
     To these people, as to others, Enoch, the seventh in descent from
Adam, declared -- "See! The Lord has come with his hosts of holy ones
around him, to execute judgment on all people, and to convict all
godless people of all their godless acts, which in their ungodliness
they have committed, and of all the harsh words which they have spoken
against him, godless sinners that they are!"
     These people are always murmuring, and complaining of their lot;
they follow where their passions lead them; they have arrogant words on
their lips; and they flatter others for the sake of what they can get
from them.

     But you should, dear friends, recall what was foretold by the
apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ; how they used to say to you -- "As
time draws to an end, there will be scoffers, who will be led by their
godless passions." These are the people -- animal and unspiritual -- who
cause divisions. But you must, dear friends, build up your characters on
the foundation of your most holy faith, pray under the guidance of the
Holy Spirit, and keep within the love of God, while waiting for the
mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ, to bring you to eternal life. To some
show pity, because they are in doubt. "Drag them out of the fire," and
save them. To others show pity, but with caution, hating the clothing
polluted by their touch.

*Ascription*

     To him who is able to guard you from falling, and to bring you into
his glorious presence, blameless and rejoicing -- to the one God, our
Saviour, be ascribed, through Jesus Christ, our Lord, glory, majesty,
power, and dominion, as it was before time began, is now, and will be
for all time to come. Amen.

                         THE REVELATION TO JOHN
  The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave to him to make known to
his servants, concerning what must shortly take place, and which he sent
and revealed by his angel to his servant John, who testified to the
message of God and to the testimony to Jesus Christ, omitting nothing of
what he had seen. Blessed is the one who reads, and blessed are they who
listen to, the words of this prophecy, and lay to heart what is here
written; for the time is near.

*Messages to the Seven Churches*

     From John, to the seven churches which are in Roman Asia. Blessing
and peace be yours from him who is, and who was, and who will be, and
from the seven spirits that are before his throne, and from Jesus
Christ, the faithful witness, the firstborn from the dead, and the Ruler
of all the kings of the earth. To him who loves us and freed us from our
sins by his own blood -- and he made us a kingdom of priests in the
service of God, his Father! -- to him be ascribed glory and dominion for
ever. Amen. He is coming among the clouds! Every eye will see him, even
those who pierced him and all the nations of the earth will mourn over
him. So will it be. Amen.

     "I am the Alpha and the Omega," says the Lord, the God who is, and
who was, and who will be, the Almighty.
     I, John, who am your brother, and who share with you in the
suffering and kingship and endurance of Jesus, found myself on the
island called Patmos, for the sake of the message of God and the
testimony to Jesus. I fell into a trance on the Lord's day, and I heard
behind me a loud voice, like the blast of a trumpet. It said -- "Write
what you see in a book and send it to the seven churches, to Ephesus,
Smyrna, Pergamus, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, and Laodicea." I
turned to see what voice it was that spoke to me; and when I turned, I
saw seven golden lamps, and in the midst of the lamps one like a man, in
a robe reaching to his feet, and with a golden sash across his breast.
The hair of his head was as white as wool, as white as snow; his eyes
were like flaming fire; and his feet were like brass as when molten in a
furnace; his voice was like the sound of many streams, in his right hand
he held seven stars, from his mouth came a sharp two-edged sword, and
his face was like the sun in the fulness of its power. And, when I saw
him, I fell at his feet like one dead. He laid his hand on me and said
-- "Do not be afraid. I am the First and the Last, the Everliving. I
died, and I am alive for ever and ever. And I hold the keys of death and
of Hades. Therefore write of what you have seen and of what is happening
now and of what is about to take place -- the mystic meaning of the
seven stars which you saw in my right hand, and the seven golden lamps.
The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches, and the seven
lamps are the seven churches.
     'To the angel of the church in Ephesus write
    These are the words of him who holds the seven stars in his right
hand, and walks among the seven golden lamps: I know your life, your
toil and endurance, and I know that you cannot tolerate evildoers. I
know, too, how you tested those who declare that they are apostles,
though they are not, and how you proved them false. You possess
endurance, and have borne much for my name, and have never grown weary.
But this I have against you -- You have abandoned your first love.
Therefore remember from what you have fallen, and repent, and live the
life that you lived before; or else, I will come and remove your Lamp
from its place, unless you repent. But this is in your favour -- You
hate the life lived by the Nikolaitans, and I also hate it. Anyone with
ears should hear what the Spirit is saying to the churches. To him who
conquers -- to him I will give the right to eat the fruit of the Tree of
life, which stands in the Paradise of God.

     'To the angel of the church in Smyrna write:
     These are the words of him who is the First and the Last, who died,
but is restored to life: I know your persecution and your poverty -- yet
you are rich! I know, too, the slander that comes from those who declare
that they are God's people, {  (2:9)  God's people: Literally "Jews."
These people claimed to be God's people because they were Jews. }though
they are not, but are a congregation of Satan. Do not be afraid of what
you are about to suffer. The devil is about to throw some of you into
prison so that you may be tempted, and may undergo persecution for ten
days. Be faithful even to death, and I will give you the Crown of life.
Let those who have ears hear what the Spirit is saying to the churches.
Those who conquer will suffer no hurt from the Second Death.

     'To the angel of the church in Pergamus write:
     These are the words of him who holds the sharp two-edged sword: I
know where you live, where the throne of Satan stands. And yet you hold
to my name, and you did not disown my faith even in the days of Antipas,
my faithful witness, who was put to death among you where Satan dwells.
Yet I have a few things against you -- You have among you those who hold
to the teaching of Balaam, who taught Balak to put temptations in the
way of the Israelites, so that they should eat idol-offerings and commit
licentious acts. Again you have among you those who hold in the same way
to the teaching of the Nikolaitans. Therefore repent, or else, I will
come quickly and contend with such people with words that will cut like
a sword. Let those who have ears hear what the Spirit is saying to the
churches. To those who conquer -- to them I will give a share of the
mystic manna, and I will give them a white stone; and on the stone will
be inscribed a new name, which no one knows except the person who
receives it.

     'To the angel of the church in Thyatira write:
     These are the words of the Son of God, whose eyes are like flaming
fire, and whose feet are like brass: I know your life, your love, faith,
service, and endurance; and I know that your life of late has been
better than it was at first. Yet I have this against you -- You tolerate
the woman Jezebel, who declares that she is a prophet, and misleads my
servants by her teaching, until they commit licentious acts and eat
idol-offerings. I gave her time to repent, but she is determined not to
turn from her licentiousness. Therefore I am laying her on a bed of
sickness, and bringing great suffering on those who are unfaithful with
her, unless they repent and turn from a life like hers. I will also put
her children to death; and all the churches will learn that I am he who
looks into people's hearts and souls; and I will give to each one of you
what their life deserves. But I say to the rest of you at Thyatira --
all who do not accept such teaching, whose who did not learn the secrets
of Satan, as people call them -- I am not laying on you any further
burden; only hold fast to what you have received, until I come. To those
who conquer and are careful to live my life to the end -- to them I will
give authority over the nations, and they will rule them with an iron
rod, as when earthen vessels are broken in pieces (as I myself have
received from my Father) and I will give them the morning star. Let
those who have ears hear what the Spirit is saying to the churches.

     'To the angel of the church in Sardis write:
     These are the words of him who has the seven spirits of God and the
seven stars; -- I know your life, and that people say of you that you
are living, though you are dead. Be on the watch, and strengthen what
still survives, though once it was all but dead; for I have not found
your life perfect in the eyes of my God. Therefore remember what you
have received and heard, and lay it to heart and repent. Unless you are
on the watch, I will come like a thief, and you will not know at what
hour I am coming to you. Yet there are some few among you at Sardis who
did not soil their robes; they will walk with me, robed in white, for
they are worthy. Those who conquer will be clothed in these white robes,
and I will not strike their name out of the book of life; but I will own
them before my Father, and before his angels. Let those who have ears
hear what the Spirit is saying to the churches.

     'To the angel of the church in Philadelphia write:
     These are the words of him who is holy and true, who holds the Key
of David, who opens and no one will shut, and shuts and no one opens: I
know your life (see, I have set a door open before you which no one is
able to shut), I know that, though you have but little strength, you
kept my teaching in mind, and did not disown my name. Listen, I give
some of the congregation of Satan, the people who declare that they are
God's people, {  (3:9)  God's people: Literally "Jews." These people
claimed to be God's people because they were Jews. }though they are not,
but are lying -- I will make them come and bow down at your feet, and
they will learn that I loved you. Because you kept in mind the story of
my endurance, I will keep you in the hour of trial that is about to come
on the whole world, the hour that will test all who are living on earth.
I will come quickly. Hold to what you have received so that no one may
take your crown. Those who conquer -- I will make them a pillar in the
Temple of my God; and never more will they leave it; and I will write on
them the name of my God and the name of the city of my God, the New
Jerusalem, which is coming down out of heaven from my God, and I will
write on them my new name. Let those who have ears hear what the Spirit
is saying to the churches.

     'To the angel of the church in Laodicea write:
     These are the words of the Unchanging One, the witness faithful and
true, the beginning of the Creation of God: I know your life; I know
that you are neither cold nor hot. If only you were either cold or hot!
But now, because you are lukewarm, neither hot nor cold, I am about to
spit you out of my mouth. You say "I am rich and have grown rich, and I
want for nothing," and you do not know that you are wretched, miserable,
poor, blind, naked! Therefore I counsel you to buy from me gold which
has been refined by fire so that you may grow rich; and white robes, so
that you may be clothed and your shameful nakedness be hidden; and
ointment to anoint your eyes, so that you may see. All whom I love I
rebuke and discipline. Therefore be in earnest and repent. I am standing
at the door and knocking! If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I
will go in, and will feast with them, and they will feast with me. To
those who conquer -- to them I will give the right to sit beside me on
my throne, as I, when I conquered, took my seat beside my Father on his
throne. Let those who have ears hear what the Spirit is saying to the
churches.'

*The Vision of the Seven Seals*

     After this, in my vision, I saw an open door in the heavens, and
the first voice that I heard was like the blast of a trumpet speaking to
me. It said -- "Come up here and I will show you what must take place."
Immediately after this I fell into a trance. There stood a throne in
heaven, and on the throne was One seated. He who was seated on it was in
appearance like a jasper and a sardius; and round the throne there was a
rainbow of the colour of an emerald. And round the throne were twenty-
four other thrones, and on these I saw twenty-four elders sitting
clothed in white robes; and on their heads they had crowns of gold. Out
from the throne come flashes of lightning, cries, and peals of thunder!
There are seven torches burning in front of the throne, which are the
seven spirits of God; and in front of the throne is what seemed to be a
sea of glass, resembling crystal, while within the space before the
throne and round the throne are four creatures full of eyes in front and
behind. The first creature is like a lion, the second creature like a
calf, the third creature has a face like a man's, and the fourth
creature is like an eagle on the wing. These four creatures have each of
them six wings, and all round, and within, they are full of eyes; and
day and night they never cease to say --

     "Holy, holy, holy is the Lord, our God, the Almighty, who was, and
who is, and who will be."
 And, whenever these creatures give praise and honour and thanks to him
who is seated on the throne, to him who lives for ever and ever, the
twenty-four elders prostrate themselves before him who is seated on the
throne, and worship him who lives for ever and ever, and throw down
their crowns before the throne, saying --

     "Worthy are you, our Lord and God, to receive all praise, and
honour, and power, for you did create all things, and at your bidding
they came into being and were created."
  Then I saw at the right hand of him who was seated on the throne a
book, with writing inside and out, and sealed with seven seals; and I
saw a mighty angel who was proclaiming in a loud voice -- "Who is worthy
to open the book and break its seals?" But no one either in heaven or on
earth or under the earth was able to open the book or look within it. At
this I wept long, because no one could be found who was worthy to open
the book or look within it. But one of the elders said to me -- "Do not
weep. The Lion conquered -- the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Scion of
David -- and can therefore open the book with its seven seals."
     Then, within the space between the throne and the four creatures,
and in the midst of the elders, I saw, standing, a Lamb, which seemed to
have been sacrificed. It had seven horns and seven eyes. (These eyes are
the seven spirits of God, and they are sent into all the world.) The
Lamb came forward; and he has taken the book from the right hand of him
who was seated on the throne. And, when he had taken the book, the four
creatures and the twenty-four elders prostrated themselves before the
Lamb, each of them holding a harp and golden bowls full of incense.
(These are the prayers of Christ's people.) And they are singing a new
song --

     "You are worthy to take the book and break its seals, for you were
sacrificed, and with your blood you did buy for God people of every
tribe, and language, and people, and nation, and did make them a kingdom
of priests in the service of our God, and they are reigning on the
earth."
 Then, in my vision, I heard the voices of many angels round the throne,
and of the creatures, and of the elders. In number they were ten
thousand times ten thousand and thousands of thousands, and they cried
in a loud voice --

     "Worthy is the Lamb that was sacrificed to receive all power, and
wealth, and wisdom, and might, and honour, and praise, and blessing."
 And I heard every created thing in the air, and on the earth, and under
the earth, and on the sea, and all that is in them crying --

     "To him who is seated on the throne and to the Lamb be ascribed all
blessing, and honour, and praise, and dominion for ever and ever."
 And the four creatures said "Amen," and the elders prostrated
themselves and worshiped.

     Then I saw the Lamb break one of the seven seals, and I heard one
of the four creatures crying with a voice like thunder -- "Come." And in
my vision I saw a white horse. Its rider held a bow, and he was given a
crown, and he went out conquering and to conquer.
     When the Lamb broke the second seal, I heard the second creature
crying -- "Come." Then there went out another horse, a red horse, and to
its rider was given the power to deprive the earth of peace, so that
people should kill one another; and he was given a great sword.
     When the Lamb broke the third seal, I heard the third creature
crying -- "Come." And in my vision I saw a black horse. Its rider held
scales in his hand. And I heard what seemed to be a voice, coming from
among the four creatures, crying -- "A quart of wheat for a silver coin,
and three quarts of barley for a silver coin! But do not harm the oil
and the wine."
     When the Lamb broke the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the
fourth creature crying -- "Come." And in my vision I saw a grey horse.
His rider's name was Death, and Hades rode behind him; and power was
given them over the fourth part of the earth, so that they might destroy
with sword and famine and death, and by means of the wild Beasts of the
earth.
     When the Lamb opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the
souls of those who had been killed for the sake of God's message and for
the testimony which they had borne. They cried in a loud voice -- "How
long, Sovereign Lord, holy and true, before you will give judgment and
avenge our blood on all who are living on the earth?" Then to each of
them was given a white robe, and they were told to rest yet a little
longer, until the number of their fellow servants and of their friends
in Christ's service who were about to be put to death, as they had been,
should be complete.
     And I saw the Lamb break the sixth seal, and then there was a great
earthquake. The sun became black, like sackcloth, and the moon, which
was at its full, like blood. The stars of the heavens fell to the earth,
as when a fig tree, shaken by a strong wind, drops its unripe fruit. The
heavens disappeared like a scroll when it is rolled up, and every
mountain and island was moved from its place. Then all the kings of the
earth, and the princes, and the generals, and the rich, and the
powerful, and every slave and free person, hid themselves in the caves
and under the rocks of the mountains; and they are crying to the
mountains and the rocks -- "Fall on us, and hide us from the eyes of him
who is seated on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb, for the
great day of their wrath is come, and who can stand to meet it?"
     After this, I saw four angels standing on the four corners of the
earth, restraining the four winds of the earth, so that no wind should
blow over the earth, or over the sea, or against any tree. And, in the
east, I saw another angel, ascending, holding the seal of the living
God; and he cried in a loud voice to the four angels, to whom there had
been given power to harm the earth and the sea -- "Do not harm the
earth, or the sea, or the trees, until we have sealed the servants of
our God on their foreheads." I heard, too, the number of those who had
been sealed. It was one hundred and forty-four thousand; and they were
from every tribe of the Israelites.

     From the tribe of Judah twelve thousand were sealed,
     from the tribe of Reuben twelve thousand,
     from the tribe of Gad twelve thousand,
     from the tribe of Asher twelve thousand,
     from the tribe of Napthali twelve thousand,
     from the tribe of Manasseh twelve thousand,
     from the tribe of Simeon twelve thousand,
     from the tribe of Levi twelve thousand,
     from the tribe of Issachar twelve thousand,
     from the tribe of Zebulon twelve thousand,
     from the tribe of Joseph twelve thousand,
     from the tribe of Benjamin twelve thousand were sealed.
 After this, in my vision, I saw a vast throng which no one could
number, of people from every nation and of all tribes, and peoples, and
languages. They stood in front of the throne and in front of the Lamb,
robed in white, holding palm branches in their hands. And they are
crying in a loud voice --

     "Salvation be ascribed to our God who is seated on his throne and
to the Lamb."
 And all the angels were standing round the throne and the elders and
the four creatures, and they prostrated themselves on their faces in
front of the throne and worshiped God, saying --

     "Amen. Blessing and praise, and wisdom, and thanksgiving, and
honour, and power, and might be ascribed to our God for ever and ever.
Amen."


     Then one of the elders turned to me and said "Who are these who are
robed in white? And where did they come from?"
     "My Lord," I answered, "it is you who know."
     "These," he said, "are they who come through the Great Persecution;
they washed their robes white in the blood of the Lamb. And therefore it
is that they are before the throne of God, and are serving him day and
night in his Temple; and he who is seated on the throne will shelter
them. Never again will they be hungry, never again will they be thirsty,
nor will the sun smite them, nor any scorching heat; for the Lamb that
stands in the space before the throne will be their shepherd, and will
lead them to life-giving springs of water; and God will wipe away all
tears from their eyes."
     As soon as the Lamb had broken the seventh seal, there was silence
in heaven for, it might be, half an hour.

*Vision of Seven Trumpet-Blasts*

     Then I saw the seven angels who stand before God, and seven
trumpets were given to them.
     Next, another angel came and stood at the altar with a golden
censer in his hand; and a great quantity of incense was given to him, to
mingle with the prayers of all Christ's people on the golden altar
before the throne. The smoke of the incense ascended, with the prayers
of Christ's people, from the hand of the angel before God. Then the
angel took the censer, and filled it with fire from the altar, and threw
it down on the earth; and there followed peals of thunder, cries,
flashes of lightning, and an earthquake. Then the seven angels holding
the seven trumpets prepared to blow their blasts.

     The first blew; and there came hail and fire mixed with blood, and
it fell on the earth. A third part of the earth was burnt up, and a
third of the trees, and every blade of grass.
     Then the second angel blew; and what appeared to be a great
mountain, burning, was hurled into the sea. A third of the sea became
blood, and a third part of all created things that are in the sea --
that is, of all living things -- died, and a third of the ships was
destroyed.
     Then the third angel blew; and there fell from the heavens a great
star, burning like a torch. It fell on a third of the rivers and on the
springs. (The star is called "Wormwood.") A third of the water became
bitter as wormwood, and so bitter was the water that many died from
drinking it.
     Then the fourth angel blew; and a third of the sun and a third of
the moon and a third of the stars were blasted, so that a third of them
was eclipsed, and for a third part of the day there was no light, and at
night it was the same.
     And, in my vision, I heard an eagle flying in mid-heaven and crying
in a loud voice -- "Woe, woe, woe for all who live on the earth, at the
other trumpet-blasts of the three angels who have yet to blow."
     Then the fifth angel blew; and I saw a star that had fallen on the
earth from the heavens, and to him was given the key of the bottomless
pit. He opened the bottomless pit, and from the pit rose a smoke like
the smoke of a great furnace. The sun and the air grew dark because of
the smoke from the pit. Out of the smoke locusts descended on the earth,
and they received the same power as that possessed by scorpions. They
were told not to harm the grass, or any plant, or any tree, but only
those who have not the seal of God on their foreheads. Yet they were not
allowed to kill them, but it was ordered that those men should be
tortured for five months. Their torture was like the torture caused by a
scorpion when it stings a person. In those days people will seek Death
and will not find it; They will long to die, but Death flees from them.
In appearance the locusts were like horses equipped for battle. On their
heads there were what appeared to be crowns that shone like gold, their
faces resembled human faces, and they had hair like the hair of a woman,
their teeth were like lions' teeth, and they had what seemed to be iron
breastplates, while the noise of their wings was like the noise of
chariots drawn by many horses, galloping into battle. They have tails
like scorpions, and stings, and in their tails lies their power to harm
people for five months. They have as their king the angel of the
bottomless pit, whose name, in Hebrew, is "Abaddon," while, in Greek,
his name is "Apollyon" (the Destroyer).
     The first Woe has passed; and still there are two Woes to follow!

     Then the sixth angel blew; and I heard a voice proceeding from the
corners of the golden altar that stood before God. It spoke to the sixth
angel -- the angel with the trumpet -- and said "Let loose the four
angels that are in chains at the great river Euphrates." Then the four
angels, that were held in readiness for that hour and day and month and
year, were let loose, to destroy a third of mankind. The number of the
hosts of cavalry was ten thousand times ten thousand, twice told; I
heard their number. And this is what the horses and their riders
appeared to be like in my vision: They had breastplates of fire, blood-
red and sulphurous, and the heads of the horses were like lions' heads,
while out of their mouths issue fire, and smoke, and sulphur. Through
these three curses a third of humanity perished -- because of the fire,
and the smoke, and the sulphur that issued from their mouths; for the
power of the horses lies in their mouths and in their tails. For their
tails are like snakes, with heads, and it is with them that they do
harm. But those who were left of humanity, who had not perished through
these curses, did not repent and turn away from what their own hands had
made; they would not abandon the worship of demons, and of idols made of
gold or silver or brass or stone or wood, which can neither see, nor
hear, nor walk; and they did not repent of their murders, or their
sorceries, or their licentiousness, or their thefts.
     Then I saw another mighty angel, descending from heaven. His robe
was a cloud; over his head was the rainbow; his face was like the sun,
and his feet like pillars of fire; in his hand he held a little book
open. He set his right foot on the sea, and his left on the land; and he
cried in a loud voice like the roaring of a lion. At his cry the seven
peals of thunder spoke, each with its own voice. And, when they spoke, I
was about to write; but I heard a voice from heaven say -- "Keep secret
what the seven peals of thunder said, and do not write it down." Then
the angel, whom I had seen standing on the sea and on the land, raised
his right hand to the heavens, and swore by him who lives for ever and
ever, who created the heavens and all that is in them, and the earth and
all that is in it, and the sea and all that is in it, that time should
cease to be. Moreover at the time when the seventh angel will speak,
when he is ready to blow his blast, then the hidden purposes of God, of
which he told the good news to his servants, the prophets, are at once
fulfilled. Then came the voice which I had heard from heaven. It spoke
to me again, and said -- "Go and take the book that is open in the hand
of the angel who stands on the sea and on the land." So I went to the
angel and asked him to give me the little book. And he said "Take it,
and eat it. It will be bitter to your stomach, but in your mouth it will
be as sweet as honey." I took the little book out of the angel's hand
and ate it, and, while in my mouth, it was like the sweetest honey; but,
when I had eaten it, it was bitter to my stomach. And I was told -- "You
must prophesy again about men of many peoples, and nations, and
languages, and about many kings."
     Then I was given a measure like a rod, and a voice said to me --
"Go and measure the Temple of God and the altar, and count the worshiper
there. But omit the court outside the Temple, and do not measure that,
for it has been given up to the nations; and the holy City will be under
their heel for forty-two months. Then I will give permission to my Two
Witnesses, and for those twelve hundred and sixty days they will
continue teaching, clothed in sackcloth." These men are represented by
the two olive trees and the two lamps that stand before the Lord of the
earth. When anyone wishes to harm them, fire comes from their mouths and
consumes their enemies; and whoever wishes to harm them will, in this
way, inevitably perish. These men have the power to close the heavens,
so that no rain may fall during the time that they are teaching; and
they have power to turn the streams into blood, and to smite the land
with any curse, whenever they will. As soon as they have completed their
testimony, the wild Beast that ascends from the bottomless pit will make
war on them and conquer and kill them. Their dead bodies will lie in the
streets of the great city, which is mystically spoken of as "Sodom" and
"Egypt," where their Master was crucified. People of all nations, and
tribes, and languages, and races look at their dead bodies for three
days and a half, and do not allow them to be laid in a grave. Those who
live on the earth rejoice over them and are merry, and they will send
presents to one another, because these two prophets brought torments on
those who live on the earth. After three days and a half the life-giving
breath of God entered these men, and they stood up on their feet, and a
great terror took possession of those who were watching them. The two
men heard a loud voice from heaven which said to them -- "Come up here,"
and they went up to heaven in the cloud, while their enemies watched
them. At that very time a great earthquake occurred. A tenth part of the
city fell, and seven thousand people perished in the earthquake. Those
who escaped were much terrified, and praised the God of heaven.
     The second Woe has passed; and there is a third Woe soon to follow!

     Then the seventh angel blew; and loud voices were heard in heaven
saying --

     "The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of
his Christ, and he will reign for ever and ever."
 At this the twenty-four elders, who were seated on their thrones before
God, prostrated themselves on their faces and worshiped him, saying --

     "We thank you, Lord, our God, the Almighty, who is and who was,
that you have assumed your great power and reigned. The nations were
enraged, and your wrath fell on them; the time came for the dead to be
judged, and for you to give the reward to your servants the prophets,
and to the people of Christ, and to those who honour your name -- the
high and the low alike -- and to destroy those who are destroying the
earth."
 Then the Temple of God in heaven was opened, and the ark containing his
covenant was seen in his Temple; and there followed flashes of
lightning, cries, peals of thunder, an earthquake, and a great storm of
hail.

*Vision of Seven Figures*

     Then a great portent was seen in the heavens -- a woman whose robe
was the sun, and who had the moon under her feet, and on her head a
crown of twelve stars. She was pregnant; and she is crying out in the
pain and agony of childbirth. Another portent also was seen in the
heavens There was a great red Dragon, with seven heads and ten horns,
and on his heads were seven diadems. His tail draws after it a third of
the stars in the heavens, and it hurled them down on the earth. The
Dragon is standing in front of the woman who is about to give birth to
the child, so that he may devour it as soon as it is born. The woman
gave birth to a son, a male child, who is destined to rule all the
nations with an iron rod; and her child was at once caught up to God on
his throne. But the woman fled into the wilderness, where there is a
place prepared for her by God, to be tended there for twelve hundred and
sixty days.
     Then a battle took place in the heavens. Michael and his angels
fought with the Dragon. But though the Dragon, with his angels, fought,
he did not prevail; and there was no place left for them any longer in
the heavens. Then the great Dragon, the primeval snake, known as the
"devil" and "Satan," who deceives all the world, was hurled down to the
earth, and his angels were hurled down with him. And I heard a loud
voice in heaven which said --

     "Now has begun the day of the salvation, and Power, and Dominion of
our God, and the Rule of his Christ; for the Accuser of our people has
been hurled down, he who has been accusing them before our God day and
night. Their victory was due to the blood of the Lamb, and to the
message to which they bore their testimony. In their love of life they
shrank not from death. Therefore, be glad, heaven, and all who live in
heaven! Alas for the earth and for the sea, for the devil has gone down
to you in great fury, knowing that he has but little time."
 When the Dragon saw that he was hurled down to the earth, he pursued
the woman who had given birth to the male child. But to the woman were
given the two wings of the great eagle, so that she might fly to her
place in the wilderness, where she is being tended for one year, and for
two years, and for half a year in safety from the snake. Then the snake
poured water from its mouth after the woman, like a river, so that it
might sweep her away. But Earth came to her help, and opened her mouth
and drank up the river which the Dragon had poured out of its mouth. The
Dragon was enraged at the woman, and went to fight with the rest of her
offspring -- those who lay to heart the commands of God and bear their
testimony to Jesus; and he took his stand on the sea-shore.
     Then I saw, rising out of the sea, a wild Beast with ten horns and
seven heads. On its horns were ten diadems, and on its heads were
blasphemous names. The Beast that I saw was like a leopard; but its feet
were like a bear's, and its mouth like the mouth of a lion. The Dragon
gave it his power and his throne, and wide dominion. One of its heads
seemed to me to have been mortally wounded, but its deadly wound had
been healed. The whole earth followed the Beast, wondering; and men
worshiped the Dragon, because he had given his dominion to the Beast;
while, as they worshiped the Beast, they said -- "Who can compare with
the Beast? And who can fight with it?" The Beast was given a mouth that
spoke proudly and blasphemously, and it was empowered to work its will
for forty-two months. It opened its mouth only to blaspheme God, to
blaspheme his name and his tent -- those who live in his tent in heaven.
It had been permitted to fight with Christ's people and to conquer them,
and it had received power over men of every tribe, and people, and
language, and nation. All who are living on earth will worship it -- all
whose names have not been written in the Lamb's book of life, the Lamb
that has been sacrificed from the foundation of the world. Let those who
have ears hear. Whoever is destined for captivity goes into captivity.
Whoever will kill with the sword must inevitably be killed with the
sword. (Here there is need for endurance and faith on the part of
Christ's people.)
     Then I saw, rising out of the earth, another wild Beast. It had two
horns like those of a lamb, and its voice was like a dragon's. It
exercises all the authority of the first Beast under its eyes; and it
makes the earth and all who are living on it worship that first Beast,
whose mortal wound was healed. It performs great marvels, even causing
fire to fall from the heavens to the earth, before people's eyes; and in
consequence of the marvels which it was allowed to perform under the
eyes of the Beast, it is able to deceive all who are living on the
earth. It tells those who live on the earth to make a statue in honour
of the Beast, who, despite the wound from the sword, yet lived. It was
permitted to breathe life into the image of the Beast, so that the image
of the Beast might speak; and it was also permitted to cause all who
refused to worship the image of the Beast to be put to death. High and
low, rich and poor, free and enslaved -- it causes a brand to be put on
the right hand or on the forehead of every one of them, so that no one
is able to buy or sell, except those that bear this brand -- either the
name of the Beast or the number indicated by the letters of his name.
(Here there is need for discernment.) The person with ability can
compute the number of the Beast; for the number indicates a person's
name. Its number is six hundred and sixty-six.

     Then, in my vision, I saw the Lamb standing on Mount Zion. With him
were a hundred and forty-four thousand, with his name and the name of
his Father written on their foreheads. And I heard a sound from heaven,
like the sound of many waters, and like the sound of a loud peal of
thunder; the sound that I heard was like the music of harpers playing on
their harps. They are singing what seems to be a new song, before the
throne, and before the four creatures and the elders; and no one was
able to learn that song except the hundred and forty-four thousand who
had been redeemed from earth. These are the men who never defiled
themselves in their intercourse with women; they are as pure as virgins.
These are the men who follow the Lamb wherever he goes. They were
redeemed as the first-fruits of mankind for God and for the Lamb. No lie
was ever heard on their lips. They are beyond reach of blame.

     Then I saw another angel, flying in mid-heaven. He had the good
news, decreed from eternity, to announce to those who live on the earth
-- to men of every nation, and tribe, and language, and people; and he
cried in a loud voice -- "Reverence God, and give him praise (for the
hour of his judgment has come) and worship him who made the heaven and
the earth and the sea and all springs of water."
     Then a second angel followed, crying -- "She has fallen! She has
fallen -- Babylon the Great, who has made all the nations drink the
maddening wine of her licentiousness!"
     Then a third angel followed them, crying in a loud voice --
"Whoever worships the Beast and its image, and receives its brand on his
forehead or on his hand, that person will drink the maddening wine of
God that has been poured unmixed into the cup of his wrath, and they
will be tortured with fire and sulphur before the eyes of the holy
angels and before the eyes of the Lamb. The smoke from their torture
rises for ever and ever, and they have no rest day nor night -- those
who worship the Beast and its image, and all who are branded with its
name." (Here there is need for endurance on the part of Christ's people
-- those who lay to heart the commands of God and the faith of Jesus.)
Then I heard a voice from heaven saying "Write: 'Blessed are the dead
who from this hour die in union with the Lord.'"
     'Yes,' answers the Spirit, 'that they may rest from their toil.
Their good deeds go with them.'

     Then, in my vision, I saw a white cloud, and on the cloud there was
sitting one like a man. On his head he had a crown of gold, and in his
hand a sharp sickle.
     Then another angel came out from the Temple, crying in a loud voice
to him who was sitting on the cloud -- "Take your sickle and reap, for
the time to reap has come; the Harvest of Earth is ready." He who was
sitting on the cloud brought his sickle down on the earth, and the
Harvest of Earth was reaped.
     Then another angel came out of the Temple in heaven; he, also, had
a sharp sickle.
     Then another angel came out of the altar; he had power over fire,
and he called in a loud voice to the angel that had the sharp sickle --
"Take your sharp sickle, and gather the bunches from the vine of Earth,
for its grapes are ripe." The angel brought his sickle down on the earth
and gathered the fruit of the vine of Earth, and threw it into the great
winepress of the wrath of God. The grapes were trodden in the press
outside the city; and blood came out of the press, rising as high as the
bridles of the horses for a distance of two hundred miles.

*Vision of Seven Curses*

     Then I saw another portent in the heavens -- a great and marvellous
portent -- seven angels with the seven last curses; because with them
the wrath of God is ended.
     Then I saw what appeared to be a sea of glass mixed with fire; and,
standing by this sea of glass, holding the harps of God, I saw those who
had come victorious out of the conflict with the Beast and its image and
the number that formed its name. They are singing the song of Moses, the
servant of God, and the song of the Lamb --

     "Great and marvellous are your deeds, Lord, our God, the Almighty.
Righteous and true are your ways, eternal King. Who will not honour and
praise your name, Lord? You alone are holy! All nations will come and
worship before you, for your judgments have become manifest."
 After this I saw that the inmost shrine of the tent of testimony in
heaven was opened, and out of it came the seven angels with the seven
curses. They were adorned with precious stones, pure and bright, and had
golden girdles round their breasts. One of the four creatures gave the
seven angels seven golden bowls, filled with the wrath of God who lives
for ever and ever. The Temple was filled with smoke from the glory and
majesty of God; and no one could enter the Temple, until the seven
curses inflicted by the seven angels were at an end.  Then I heard a
loud voice, which came from the Temple, saying to the seven angels --
"Go and empty the seven bowls of the wrath of God on the earth."
     The first angel went and emptied his bowl on the earth; and it
turned to loathsome and painful sores on all who bore the brand of the
Beast and who worshiped its image.
     Then the second angel emptied his bowl on the sea; and it turned to
blood like the blood of a corpse, and every living thing died --
everything in the sea.
     Then the third angel emptied his bowl on the rivers and springs of
water; and it turned to blood. And I heard the angel of the Waters
saying -- "Righteous are you, you who is and who is, the Holy One, in
inflicting this judgment; for men shed the blood of Christ's people and
of the prophets, and you have given them blood to drink. It is what they
deserve." And I heard the response from the altar -- "Yes, Lord, our
God, the Almighty, true and righteous are they judgments."
     Then the fourth angel emptied his bowl on the sun; and he was
permitted to scorch men with fire; and men were scorched by the intense
heat. They blasphemed the name of God who controlled these curses, yet
they did not repent and give him praise.
     Then the fifth angel emptied his bowl on the throne of the Beast;
and darkness fell on its kingdom. Men gnawed their tongues for pain, and
blasphemed the God of heaven, because of their pains and because of
their sores; yet they did not repent of what they had done.
     Then the sixth angel emptied his bowl on the great river Euphrates;
and the water in the river was dried up, so that the road for the kings
of the East might be made ready. And I saw three foul spirits, like
frogs, come from the mouth of the Dragon and from the mouth of the Beast
and from the mouth of the false prophet. They are the spirits of demons,
and perform marvels; they go to kings all over the world, to collect
them for the battle on the great day of Almighty God. ("I am coming like
a thief! Happy will he be who is on the watch, and keeps his clothing at
hand, so that he will not have to walk about unclothed and let men see
his nakedness.") And the spirits collected the kings at the place called
in Hebrew "Har-Magedon."
     Then the seventh angel emptied his bowl on the air. (A loud voice
came from the throne in the Temple; it said "All is over.") There
followed flashes of lightning, cries, and peals of thunder; and there
was a great earthquake, such as had not occurred since man began to be
on the earth -- none so great; and the great city was torn in three, and
the cities of the nation fell, and God remembered Babylon the Great, and
gave her the maddening wine-cup of his wrath; and every island vanished,
and the mountains disappeared. Great hailstones, a pound in weight, are
falling on men from the heavens. And men blasphemed God because of the
curse of the hail, for it was a very terrible curse.

*Doom of the Enemies of Christ*

     Then one of the seven angels who held the seven bowls came and
spoke to me. "Come here," he said, "and I will show you the sentence
passed on that infamous prostitute who is seated at the meeting of many
waters, and with whom all the kings of the earth have had licentious
intercourse; while all who live on the earth have been make drunk by the
wine of her licentiousness." And he bore me away in a trance to a lonely
place, and I saw a woman seated on a scarlet Beast, which was covered
with blasphemous names; it had seven heads and ten horns. The woman was
clothed in purple and scarlet, and glittering with gold ornaments,
precious stones, and pearls. In her hand she held a gold cup, full of
idolatrous abominations, and the unclean fruits of her licentiousness;
while on her forehead was inscribed a name that had a hidden meaning:
"Babylon the Great, mother of all prostitutes, source of all obscenities
on earth." And I saw the woman drunk with the blood of Christ's people
and with the blood of the martyrs for Jesus. When I saw her, I was
amazed beyond measure; but the angel said to me -- "Why were you amazed?
I will tell you the mystic meaning of the vision of this woman, and of
the Beast, with the seven heads and ten horns, that carries her. The
Beast that you saw was, but is not, and is about to rise out of the
bottomless pit, and is on its way to destruction. Those who are living
on earth will be amazed -- those whose names have not been written in
the book of life from the foundation of the world -- when they see that
the Beast was, but is not, and yet will come." (Here there is need for
the discerning mind.) The seven heads are seven mountains on which the
woman is seated. They are also seven kings; of whom five have fallen and
one remains, while one is not yet come. When he comes, he must stay for
a little while. So must the Beast that was, but is not. He counts as an
eighth king, although he is one of the seven, and is on his way to
destruction. The ten horns that you saw are ten kings, who have not yet
received their kingdoms, but for an hour they receive the authority of
kings, together with the Beast. These kings are of one mind in
surrendering their power and authority to the Beast. They will fight
with the Lamb, but the Lamb will conquer them, for he is Lord of lords
and King of kings; so, too, will those with him who have received the
call and are chosen and faithful. And the angel said to me -- "The
waters that you saw, where the prostitute is seated, are throngs of
people and men of all nations and languages. The ten horns that you saw,
and the Beast -- they will hate the prostitute, and cause her to become
deserted and strip her bare; they will eat her flesh and utterly consume
her with fire. For God has put it into their minds to carry out his
purpose, in carrying out their common purpose and surrendering their
kingdoms to the Beast, until God's decrees will be executed. As for the
woman whom you saw, she is the great city that holds sway over all the
kings of the earth."
     After this I saw another angel, descending from heaven, invested
with great authority; and the earth was illuminated by his splendour.
With a mighty voice he cried -- 'She has fallen! She has fallen --
Babylon the Great! She has become an abode of demons, a stronghold of
every wicked spirit, a stronghold of every foul and hateful bird. For,
after drinking the maddening wine of her licentiousness, all the nations
have fallen; while all the kings of the earth have had licentious
intercourse with her, and the merchants of the earth have grown rich
through the excess of her luxury.' Then I heard another voice from
heaven saying -- 'Come out of her, my people, so that you may not
participate in her sins, and that you may not suffer from the curses
inflicted on her. For her sins are heaped up to the heavens, and God has
not forgotten her misdeeds. Pay her back the treatment with which she
has treated you; yes, repay twice over what her actions deserve; in the
cup which she mixed for you, mix for her as much again; for her self-
glorification and her luxury, give her now an equal measure of torture
and misery. In her heart she says "I sit here a queen; no widow am I; I
will never know misery." Therefore in one day will these curses strike
her -- death, misery, and famine, and she will be utterly consumed by
fire; for mighty is the Lord God who condemned her.' All the kings of
the earth who had licentious intercourse with her and shared her luxury
will weep and lament over her, when they see the smoke from the burning
city, while they stand at a distance, horrified at her torture, and cry
-- 'Alas! Alas! Great city! Mighty city of Babylon! In a single hour
your judgment fell.' And the merchants of the earth weep and wail over
her, because no longer does anyone buy their cargoes -- their cargoes of
gold, or silver, or precious stones, or pearls, or fine linen, or purple
robes, or silk, or scarlet cloth; nor their many scented woods; nor
their many articles of ivory; nor their many articles of choicest wood,
or brass, or iron, or marble; nor their cinnamon, or spice, or incense,
or perfumes, or frankincense, or wine, or oil, or fine flour, or wheat,
or cattle, or sheep; nor their horses, or chariots, or slaves; nor the
bodies and souls of people. The fruit that your soul craved is no longer
within your reach, and all dainties and luxuries are lost to you, never
to be found again. The merchants who sold these things, and grew rich by
her, will stand at a distance weeping and wailing, horrified at her
torture, and crying -- 'Alas! Alas! Great city! City clothed in fine
linen, and purple, and scarlet cloth! City adorned with gold ornaments,
and precious stones, and pearls! In a single hour your vast wealth
vanished.' Every ship's captain and all who sail to any port, and
sailors, and all who get their living from the sea, stood at a distance,
and seeing the smoke from the burning city, cried -- 'What city can
compare with the Great city?' They threw dust on their heads, and, as
they wept and wailed, they cried -- 'Alas! Alas! Great city! All who
have ships on the sea grew rich through her magnificence. In a single
hour it has vanished.' Rejoice over her, heaven, and people of Christ,
and apostles, and prophets, for God has avenged you on her! Then a
mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone, and threw it into
the sea, crying -- 'So will Babylon, the great city, be violently
overthrown, never more to be seen. No more will the music of harpers, or
minstrels, or flute players, or trumpeters be heard in you, no more will
any worker, skilled in any art, be found in you; no more will the sound
of a mill be heard in you; no more will the light of a lamp shine in
you; no more will the voices of groom and bride be heard in you. Your
merchants were the great men of the earth, for all the nations were
deceived by your magical charms.' Yes, and in her was to be found the
blood of the prophets and of Christ's people, and of all who have been
put to death on the earth.

     After this, I heard what seemed to be a great shout from a vast
throng in heaven, crying --

     "Hallelujah! To our God belong salvation, and glory, and Power, for
true and righteous are his judgments. For he has passed judgment on the
infamous prostitute who was corrupting the earth by her licentiousness,
and he has taken vengeance on her for the blood of his servants."
 Again they cried -- "Hallelujah!" And the smoke from her ruins rises
for ever and ever. Then the twenty-four elders and the Four creatures
prostrated themselves and worshiped God who was seated on the throne,
crying -- "Amen, Hallelujah!"; and from the throne there came a voice
which said --

     "Praise our God all you who serve him, You who worship him, both
high and low."
 Then I heard what seemed to be the shout of a vast throng, like the
sound of many waters, and like the sound of loud peals of thunder,
crying --

     "Hallelujah! For the Lord is king, our God, the Almighty. Let us
rejoice and exalt; and we will pay him honour, for the hour for the
Marriage of the Lamb has come, and his Bride has made herself ready. And
to her it has been granted to robe herself in fine linen, white and
pure, for that linen is the good deeds of the people of Christ."
 Then a voice said to me "Write -- 'Blessed are those who have been
summoned to the marriage feast of the Lamb.'" And the voice said --
"These words of God are true." I prostrated myself at the feet of him
who spoke to worship him, but he said to me -- "No! I am your fellow
servant, and the fellow servant of your brothers and sisters who bear
their testimony to Jesus. Worship God. For to bear testimony to Jesus
needs the inspiration of the prophets." Then I saw that heaven lay open.
There appears a white horse; its rider is called "Faithful" and "True";
righteously does he judge and make war. His eyes are flaming fires; on
his head there are many diadems, and he bears a name, written, which no
one knows but himself; he has been clothed in a garment sprinkled with
blood; and the name by which he is called is "The Word of God." The
armies of heaven followed him, mounted on white horses and clothed in
fine linen, white and pure. From his mouth comes a sharp sword, with
which to smite the nations; and he will rule them with an iron rod. He
treads the grapes in the press of the maddening wine of the wrath of
Almighty God; and on his robe and on his thigh he has this name written
-- "KING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS."

     Then I saw an angel standing on the sun. He cried in a loud voice
to all the birds that fly in mid-heaven -- "Gather and come to the great
feast of God, to eat the flesh of kings, and the flesh of commanders,
and the flesh of mighty men, and the flesh of horses and their riders,
and the flesh of all free and enslaved, and of high and low." Then I saw
the Beast and the kings of the earth and their armies, gathered together
to fight with him who sat on the horse and with his army. The Beast was
captured, and with him was taken the false prophet, who performed the
marvels before the eyes of the Beast, with which he deceived those who
had received the brand of the Beast and those who worshiped his image.
Alive, they were thrown, both of them, into the lake of fire -- of
burning sulphur. The rest were killed by the sword which came out of the
mouth of him who rode on the horse; and all the birds fed on their
flesh.

     Then I saw an angel coming down from heaven, with the key of the
bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand. He seized the Dragon, the
primeval snake (who is the "devil" or "Satan"), and bound him in chains
for a thousand years. He flung him into the bottomless pit and locked
it, and set his seal on it; that he should not deceive the nations any
more, until the thousand years were ended. After that he must be let
loose for a while.
     Then I saw thrones, and to those who took their seats on them
authority was given to act as judges. And I saw the souls of those who
had been beheaded because of the testimony to Jesus and because of the
message of God, for they had refused to worship the Beast or its image,
and had not received the brand on their foreheads and on their hands.
They were restored to life, and they reigned with the Christ for a
thousand years. (The rest of the dead were not restored to life until
the thousand years were ended.) This is the first resurrection. Blessed
and holy will he be who shares in that first resurrection. The second
Death has no power over them; but they will be priests of God, and the
Christ, and they will reign with him for the thousand years.
     When the thousand years are ended, Satan will be let loose from his
prison, and he will come out to deceive the nations that live in the
four corners of the earth -- Gog and Magog. He will come to gather them
together for battle; and their number will be as great as the sand on
the sea-shore. They went up over the breadth of the whole earth, and
surrounded the camp of Christ's people and the city that he loves. Then
fire fell from the heavens and consumed them; and the devil, their
deceiver, was hurled into the lake of fire and sulphur, where the Beast
and the false prophet already were, and they will be tortured day and
night for ever and ever.

     Then I saw a great white throne, and him who was seated on it. The
earth and the heavens fled from his presence; no place was left for
them. And I saw the dead, high and low, standing before the throne; and
books were opened. Then another book was opened, the book of life; and
the dead were judged, according to their actions, by what was written in
the books. The sea gave up its dead, and Death and Hades gave up their
dead; and they were judged, one by one, each according to his actions.
Then Death and Hades were hurled into the lake of fire. This is the
Second Death -- the lake of fire; and all whose names were not found
written in the book of life were hurled into the lake of fire.

*The New Creation*

     Then I saw new heavens and a new earth. The former heavens and the
former earth had passed away; and the sea has ceased to be. And I saw
the Holy City, Jerusalem, descending new out of heaven from God, like a
bride adorned in readiness for her husband. And I heard a loud voice
from the throne, which said -- "See! The tent of God is set up among
people. God will live among them, and they will be his Peoples, and God
himself will be among them, and he will wipe away all tears from their
eyes. There will be no more death, nor will there be any more grief or
crying or pain. The old order has passed away." And he who was seated on
the throne said -- "See, I make all things new!" And he said -- "Write
this, for these words may be trusted and are true." And he said to me --
"They are fulfilled. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the
End. To those who thirst I will give of the spring of the water of life,
freely. Those who conquer will enter into possession of these things,
and I will be their God, and they will be my children. But as for
cowards, unbelievers, the degraded, murderers, the impure, sorcerers,
idolaters, and all liars -- their place will be in the burning lake of
fire and sulphur. That is the Second Death."

     Then one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls, and were
laden with the seven last curses, came and spoke to me. "Come here," he
said, "and I will show you the Bride, the Wife of the Lamb." He carried
me away in a trance to a great high mountain, and showed me Jerusalem,
the Holy City, descending out of heaven from God, filled with the glory
of God. Its brilliance was like a precious stone, like a jasper,
transparent as crystal. It had a great high wall, in which were twelve
gates; and at these gates there were twelve angels, and there were names
inscribed on the gates, the names of the twelve tribes of the
Israelites. There were three gates on the east, three gates on the
north, three gates on the south, and three gates on the west. The wall
of the city had twelve foundation stones, on which were the twelve names
of the twelve apostles of the Lamb. And the angel who was speaking to me
had as a measure a gold rod, with which to measure the city and its
gates and its wall. The city is square; the length and the breadth are
the same. The angel measured with his rod; it was twelve hundred miles;
its length, and breadth, and height are equal. Then he measured the
wall; it was two hundred and eighty-eight feet, as people measure, that
is as the angel measured. The material of the wall of the city was
jasper, and the city was built of pure gold, which shone like clear
glass. The foundations of the wall of the city were ornamented with
every kind of precious stone. The first foundation stone was a jasper;
the second a sapphire; the third a chalcedony; the fourth an emerald;
the fifth a sardonyx; the sixth a carnelian; the seventh a chrysolite;
the eighth a beryl; the ninth a topaz; the tenth a chrysoprase; the
eleventh a hyacinth; and the twelfth an amethyst. The twelve gates were
made of twelve pearls, each gate of one pearl. The street of the city
was of pure gold, transparent as glass. And I saw no Temple there, for
the Lord, our God, the Almighty, and the Lamb are its Temple. The city
has no need of the sun or the moon to shine on it, for the glory of God
illuminated it, and its Lamp was the Lamb. The nations walk by the light
of it; and the kings of the earth bring their glory into it. Its gates
will never be shut by day, and there will be no night there. And people
will bring the glory and honour of the nations into it. Never will any
unhallowed thing enter it, nor they whose life is shameful and false,
but only those whose names have been written in the Lamb's book of life.
And the angel showed me a river of the water of life, as clear as
crystal, issuing from the throne of God and of the Lamb, in the middle
of the street of the city. On each side of the river was a Tree of life
which bore twelve kinds of fruit, yielding its fruit each month; and the
leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations. Every thing that
is accursed will cease to be. The throne of God and of the Lamb will be
within it, and his servants will worship him; they will see his face,
and his name will be on their foreheads. Night will cease to be. They
have no need of the light of a lamp, nor have they the light of the sun;
for the Lord God will be their light, and they will reign for ever and
ever.

*Conclusion*

     Then the angel said to me -- 'These words may be trusted and are
true. The Lord, the God that inspires the prophets, sent his angel to
show his servants what must quickly take place; and they said "I will
come quickly." Blessed will he be who lays to heart the words of the
prophecy contained in this book.'
     It was I, John, who heard and saw these things; and, when I heard
and saw them, I prostrated myself in worship at the feet of the angel
that showed them to me. But he said to me -- 'Forbear; I am your fellow
servant, and the fellow servant of your fellow prophets, and of all who
lay to heart the words in this book. Worship God.'
     Then the angel said to me -- 'Do not keep secret the words of the
prophecy contained in this book; for the time is near. Let the wrongdoer
continue to do wrong; the filthy-minded continue to be filthy; the
righteous continue to act righteously; and the holy-minded continue to
be holy.' ("I will come quickly. I bring my rewards with me, to give to
each what their actions deserve. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the First
and the Last, the beginning and the End.") Blessed will they be who wash
their robes! They will have the right to approach the Tree of life, and
may enter the city by the gates. Outside will be the filthy, the
sorcerers, the impure, the murderers, the idolaters, and all who love
the false and live it.

     "I, Jesus, sent my angel to bear testimony to you about these
things before the churches. I am the Scion and the Offspring of David,
the bright star of the Morning."

     "Come," say the Spirit and the Bride; and all who hear, say "Come."
All who thirst, come; anyone who wants, take the water of life freely.

     I declare to all who hear the words of the prophecy contained in
this book -- "If anyone adds to it, God will add to his troubles the
curses described in this book; and if anyone takes away any of the words
in the book containing this prophecy, God will take away his share in
the Tree of life, and in the Holy City -- as described in this book."

     He whose testimony this is says -- "Assuredly I will come quickly."
"Amen, come, Lord Jesus."

     May the blessing of the Lord Jesus Christ, be with his people.

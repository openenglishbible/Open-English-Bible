{\cf1\f1\fs22 1}To the church of God in Corinth, and to all Christ\uc1\u8217*s people throughout Greece, from Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus, by the will of God, and from Timothy, who is also a follower.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 2}May God, our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ bless you and give you peace.

{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 3}Blessed is the God and Father of Jesus Christ our Lord, the all-merciful Father, the God ever ready to console,{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 4}who consoles us in all our troubles, so that we may be able to console those who are in any trouble with the consolation that we ourselves receive from him.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 5}It is true that we have our full share of the sufferings of the Christ, but through the Christ we have also our full share of consolation.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 6}If we meet with trouble, it is for the sake of your consolation and salvation; and, if we find consolation, it is for the sake of the consolation that you will experience when you are called to endure the sufferings that we ourselves are enduring;{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 7}and our hope for you remains unshaken. We know that, as you are sharing our sufferings, you will also share our consolation.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 8}We want you, friends, to know that, in the troubles which befell us in Roman Asia, we were burdened altogether beyond our strength, so much so that we even despaired of life.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 9}Indeed, we had the presentiment that we must die, so that we might rely, not on ourselves, but on God who raises the dead.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 10}And from so imminent a death God delivered us, and will deliver us again; for in him we have placed our hopes of future deliverance, while you, also, help us by your prayers.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 11}And then many lips will give thanks on our behalf for the blessing granted us in answer to many prayers.

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24 
{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 12}Indeed, our main ground for satisfaction is this \uc1\u8211* Our conscience tells us that our conduct in the world, and still more in our relations with you, was marked by a purity of motive and a sincerity that were inspired by God, and was based, not on worldly policy, but on the help of God.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 13}We never write anything to you other than what you will acknowledge to the very end \uc1\u8211*{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 14}And, indeed, you have already partly acknowledged it about us \uc1\u8211* that you have a right to be proud of us, as we will be proud of you, on the day of our Lord Jesus.

{\pard

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi360 
{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 15}With this conviction in my mind, I planned to come to see you first, so that your pleasure might be doubled \uc1\u8211*{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 16}To visit you both on my way to Macedonia, and to come to you again on my return from Macedonia, and then to get you to send me on my way into Judea.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 17}As this was my plan, where, pray, did I show any fickleness of purpose? Or do you think that my plans are formed on mere impulse, so that in the same breath I say \uc1\u8220*Yes\uc1\u8221* and \uc1\u8220*No\uc1\u8221*?{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 18}As God is true, the message that we brought you does not waver between \uc1\u8220*Yes\uc1\u8221* and \uc1\u8220*No\uc1\u8221*!{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 19}The Son of God, Christ Jesus, whom we \uc1\u8211* Silas, Timothy, and I \uc1\u8211* proclaimed among you, never wavered between \uc1\u8220*Yes\uc1\u8221* and \uc1\u8220*No.\uc1\u8221* With him it has always been \uc1\u8220*Yes.\uc1\u8221*{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 20}For, many as were the promises of God, in Christ is the \uc1\u8220*Yes\uc1\u8221* that fulfils them. Therefore, through Christ again, let the \uc1\u8220*Amen\uc1\u8221* rise, through us, to the glory of God.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 21}God who brings us, with you, into close union with Christ, and who consecrated us,{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 22}also set his seal on us, and gave us his Spirit in our hearts as a pledge of future blessings.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi360 
{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 23}But, as my life will answer for it, I call God to witness that it was to spare you that I deferred my visit to Corinth.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 24}I do not mean that we are to dictate to you with regard to your faith; on the contrary, we work with you for your true happiness; indeed, it is through your faith that you are standing firm.{\cf1\f1\fs22 2}For my own sake, as well, I decided not to pay you another painful visit.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 2}If it is I who cause you pain, why, who is there to cheer me, except the person whom I am paining?{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 3}So I wrote as I did because I was afraid that if I had come, I should have been pained by those who ought to have made me glad; for I felt sure that it was true of you all that my joy was in every case yours also.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 4}I wrote to you in sore trouble and distress of heart and with many tears, not to give you pain, but to let you see how intense a love I have for you.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi360 
{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 5}Now whoever has caused the pain has not so much pained me, as he has, to some extent \uc1\u8211* not to be too severe \uc1\u8211* pained every one of you.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 6}The man to whom I refer has been sufficiently punished by the penalty inflicted by the majority of you;{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 7}so that now you must take the opposite course, and forgive and encourage him, or else he may be overwhelmed by the intensity of his pain.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 8}So I entreat you to assure him of your love.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 9}I had this further object, also, in what I wrote \uc1\u8211* to find out whether you might be relied on to be obedient in everything.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 10}Anyone you forgive, I forgive them, too. Indeed, for my part, whatever I have forgiven (if I have had to forgive anything), I have forgiven for your sakes, in the presence of Christ,{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 11}so as to prevent Satan from taking advantage of us; for we are not ignorant of his devices.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi360 
{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 12}When I went to the district round Troas to tell the good news of the Christ, even though there was an opening for serving the Master,{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 13}I could get no peace of mind because I failed to find Titus, my friend; so I took leave of the people there, and went on to Macedonia.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 14}All thanks to God, who, through our union with the Christ, leads us in one continual triumph, and uses us to spread the sweet perfume of the knowledge of him in every place.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 15}For we are the fragrance of Christ ascending to God \uc1\u8211* both among those who are in the path of salvation and among those who are in the path to ruin.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 16}To the latter we are a stench which arises from death and tells of death; to the former a fragrance which arises from life and tells of life. But who is equal to such a task?{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 17}Unlike many people, we are not in the habit of making profit out of God\uc1\u8217*s message; but in all sincerity, and bearing God\uc1\u8217*s commission, we speak before him in union with Christ.

{\cf1\f1\fs22 3}Are we beginning to commend ourselves again? Or are we like some who need letters of commendation to you, or from you?{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 2}You yourselves are our letter \uc1\u8211* a letter written on our hearts, and one which everybody can read and understand.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 3}All can see that you are a letter from Christ delivered by us, a letter written, not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God, not on tablets of stone, but on tablets of human hearts.

{\pard\sb360\sa360\fs32 The Ministry of the Apostles

\par}

{\pard
\par}
{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24 
{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 4}This, then, is the confidence in regard to God that we have gained through the Christ.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 5}I do not mean that we are fit to form any judgment by ourselves, as if on our own authority;{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 6}our fitness comes from God, who himself made us fit to be assistants of a new covenant, of which the substance is, not a written Law, but a Spirit. For the written Law means death, but the Spirit gives life.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi360 
{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 7}If the system of religion which involved death, embodied in a written Law and engraved on stones, began amid such glory, that the Israelites were unable to gaze at the face of Moses because of its glory, though it was but a passing glory,{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 8}will not the religion that confers the Spirit have still greater glory?{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 9}For, if there was a glory in the religion that involved condemnation, far greater is the glory of the religion that confers righteousness!{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 10}Indeed, that which then had glory has lost its glory, because of the glory which surpasses it.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 11}And, if that which was to pass away was attended with glory, far more will that which is to endure be surrounded with glory!
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi360 
{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 12}With such a hope as this, we speak with all plainness;{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 13}unlike Moses, who covered his face with a veil, to prevent the Israelites from gazing at the disappearance of what was passing away.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 14}But their minds were slow to learn. Indeed, to this very day, at the public reading of the old covenant, the same veil remains; only for those who are in union with Christ does it pass away.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 15}But, even to this day, whenever Moses is read, a veil lies on their hearts.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 16}Yet, whenever someone turns to the Lord, the veil is removed.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 17}And the Lord is the Spirit, and, where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 18}And all of us, with faces from which the veil is lifted, seeing, as if reflected in a mirror, the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into his likeness, from glory to glory, as it is given by the Lord, the Spirit.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi360 
{\cf1\f1\fs22 4}Therefore, since it is by God\uc1\u8217*s mercy that we are engaged in this ministry, we do not lose heart.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 2}No, we have renounced the secrecy prompted by shame, refusing to adopt crafty ways, or to tamper with God\uc1\u8217*s message, and commending ourselves to everyone\uc1\u8217*s conscience, in the sight of God, by our exhibition of the truth.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 3}And, even if the good news that we bring is veiled, it is veiled only in the case of those who are on the path to ruin \uc1\u8211*{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 4}people whose minds have been blinded by the God of this age, unbelievers as they are, so that the light from the good news of the glory of the Christ, who is the incarnation of God, should not shine for them.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 5}(For it is not ourselves that we proclaim, but Christ Jesus, as Lord, and ourselves as your servants for Jesus\uc1\u8217* sake.){\super\f1\cf2\fs24 6}Indeed, the same God who said \uc1\u8220*Out of darkness light will shine,\uc1\u8221* has shone in on our hearts, so that we should bring out into the light the knowledge of the glory of God, seen in the face of Christ.

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi360 
{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 7}This treasure we have in these earthen vessels, so that its all-prevailing power may be seen to come from God, and not to be our own.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 8}Though hard pressed on every side, we are never hemmed in; though perplexed, never driven to despair;{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 9}though pursued, never abandoned; though struck down, never killed!{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 10}We always bear on our bodies the marks of the death that Jesus died, so that the life also of Jesus may be exhibited in our bodies.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 11}Indeed, we who still live are continually being given over to death for Jesus\uc1\u8217* sake, so that the life also of Jesus may be exhibited in our mortal nature.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 12}And so, while death is at work within us, life is at work within you.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 13}But, in the same spirit of faith as that expressed in the words \uc1\u8211* \uc1\u8220*I believed, and therefore I spoke,\uc1\u8221* we, also believe, and therefore speak.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 14}For we know that he who raised the Lord Jesus will raise us also with him, and will bring us, with you, into his presence.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 15}For all this is for your sakes, so that the loving kindness of God, spreading from heart to heart, may cause yet more hearts to overflow with thanksgiving, to his glory.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi360 
{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 16}Therefore, as I said, we do not lose heart. No, even though outwardly we are wasting away, yet inwardly we are being renewed day by day.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 17}The light burden of our momentary trouble is preparing for us a weight of imperishable glory, beyond all measure. {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 18}We, all the while, gaze not on what is seen, but on what is unseen. For what is seen is transient, but what is unseen is imperishable.{\cf1\f1\fs22 5}For we know that if our tent \uc1\u8211* that earthly body which is now our home \uc1\u8211* is taken down, we have a house of God\uc1\u8217*s building, a home not made by hands, imperishable, in heaven.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 2}Even while in our present body we sigh, longing to put over it our heavenly house,{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 3}sure that, when we have put it on, we will never be found naked.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 4}For we who are in this tent sigh under our burden, unwilling to take it off, yet wishing to put our heavenly body over it, so that all that is mortal may be absorbed in life.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 5}And he who has prepared us for this change is God, who has also given us his Spirit as a pledge.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi360 
{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 6}Therefore we are always confident, knowing that, while our home is in the body, we are absent from our home with the Lord.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 7}For we guide our lives by faith, and not by what we see.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 8}And in this confidence we would gladly leave our home in the body, and make our home with the Lord.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 9}Therefore, whether in our home or absent from our home, our one ambition is to please him.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 10}For at the court of the Christ we must all appear in our true characters, so that each may reap the results of the life which he has lived in the body, in accordance with his actions \uc1\u8211* whether good or worthless.
\par}

{\pard 

\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi360 
{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 11}Therefore, because we know the fear inspired by the Lord, it is true that we are trying to win people over, but our motives are plain to God; and I hope that in your inmost hearts they are plain to you also.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 12}We are not \uc1\u8216*commending ourselves\uc1\u8217* again to you, but rather are giving you cause for pride in us, so that you may have an answer ready for those who pride themselves on appearances and not on character.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 13}For, if we were \uc1\u8216*beside ourselves,\uc1\u8217* it was in God\uc1\u8217*s service! If we are not in our senses, it is in yours!{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 14}It is the love of the Christ which compels us, when we reflect that, as one died for all, therefore all died;{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 15}and that he died for all, so that the living should no longer live for themselves, but for him who died and rose for them.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi360 
{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 16}For ourselves, then, from this time forward, we refuse to regard anyone from the world\uc1\u8217*s standpoint. Even if we once thought of Christ from the standpoint of the world, yet now we do so no longer.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 17}Therefore, if anyone is in union with Christ, he is a new being! His old life has passed away; a new life has begun!{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 18}But all this is the work of God, who reconciled us to himself through Christ, and gave us the ministry of reconciliation \uc1\u8211*{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 19}To proclaim that God, in Christ, was reconciling the world to himself, not reckoning people\uc1\u8217*s offences against them, and that he had entrusted us with the message of this reconciliation.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi360 
{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 20}It is, then, on Christ\uc1\u8217*s behalf that we are acting as ambassadors, God, as it were, appealing to you through us. We implore you on Christ\uc1\u8217*s behalf \uc1\u8211* Be reconciled to God.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 21}For our sake God made Christ, who was innocent of sin, one with our sinfulness, so that in him we might be made one with the righteousness of God.{\cf1\f1\fs22 6}Therefore, as God\uc1\u8217*s fellow workers, we also appeal to you not to receive his loving kindness in vain.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 2}For he says \uc1\u8211*

For it was God\uc1\u8217*s will that you should feel sorrow, in order that you should not suffer loss in any way at our hands.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 10}For, when sorrow is in accordance with God\uc1\u8217*s will, it results in a repentance leading to salvation, and which will never be regretted. The sure result of the sorrow that the world knows is death.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 11}For see what results that other sorrow \uc1\u8211* sorrow in accordance with God\uc1\u8217*s will \uc1\u8211* has had in your case. What earnestness it produced! What explanations! What strong feeling! What alarm! What longing! What eagerness! What readiness to punish! You have proved yourselves altogether free from guilt in that matter.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 12}So, then, even though I did write to you, it was not for the sake of the wrongdoer, or of the man who was wronged, but to make you conscious, in the sight of God, of your own earnest care for us.

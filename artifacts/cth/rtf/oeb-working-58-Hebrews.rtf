It was the Master who at the outset spoke of this salvation, and its authority was confirmed for us by those who heard him,{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 4}while God himself added his testimony to it by signs, and marvels, and many different miracles, as well as by imparting the Holy Spirit as he saw fit.

This \uc1\u8220*placing of everything\uc1\u8221* under humanity means that there was nothing which was not placed under them. As yet, however, we do not see everything placed under humanity.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 9}What our eyes do see is Jesus, who was made for a while lower than angels, now, because of his sufferings and death, crowned with glory and honour; so that his tasting the bitterness of death should, in God\uc1\u8217*s loving kindness, be on behalf of all humanity.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 10}It was, indeed, fitting that God, for whom and through whom all things exist, should, when leading many children to glory, make the author of their salvation perfect through suffering.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 11}For he who purifies, and those whom he purifies, all spring from One; and therefore he is not ashamed to call them his brothers and sisters.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 12}He says \uc1\u8211*

{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 14}Therefore, since human nature is the common heritage of the children, Jesus also shared it, in order that by death he might render powerless him whose power lies in death \uc1\u8211* that is, the devil \uc1\u8211*{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 15}and so might deliver all those who, from fear of death, had all their lives been living in slavery.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 16}It was not, surely, to the help of the angels that Jesus came, but to the help of the descendants of Abraham.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 17}And consequently it was necessary that he should in all points be made like his brothers and sisters, in order that he might prove a merciful as well as a faithful high priest in humanity\uc1\u8217*s relations with God, for the purpose of expiating the sins of his people.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 18}The fact that he himself suffered under temptation enables him to help those who are tempted.

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi360 
{\cf1\f1\fs22 3}Therefore, my Christian friends, you who, all alike, have received the call from heaven, fix your attention on Jesus, the apostle and high priest of our religion.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 2}See how faithful he was to the God who appointed him, as Moses was in the whole house of God.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 3}He has been deemed worthy of far higher honour than Moses, just as the founder of the house is held in greater regard than the house itself.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 4}For every house has its founder, and the founder of the universe is God.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 5}While the faithful service of Moses in the whole house of God was that of a servant, whose duty was to bear testimony to a message still to come,{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 6}the faithfulness of Christ was that of a son set over the house of God. And we are his house \uc1\u8211* if only we retain, unshaken to the end, the courage and confidence inspired by our hope.

{\cf1\f1\fs22 9}It is true that even the first covenant had its regulations for divine worship, and its sanctuary \uc1\u8211* though only a material one.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 2}For a tent was constructed, with an outer part which contained the stand for the lamps, and the table, and the consecrated bread. This is called the sanctuary.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 3}The part of the tent behind the second curtain is called the inner sanctuary.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 4}In it is the gold incense-altar, and the ark containing the covenant, completely covered with gold. In the ark is a gold casket containing the manna, Aaron\uc1\u8217*s rod that budded, and the tablets on which the covenant was written;{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 5}while above it, and overshadowing the cover on which atonement was made, are the cherubim of the presence. Now is not the time to discuss these things in detail.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 6}Such, then, was the arrangement of the tent. Into the outer part priests are constantly going, in the discharge of their sacred duties;{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 7}but into the inner only the high priest goes, and that but once a year, and never without taking the blood of a victim, which he offers on his own behalf, and on behalf of the errors of the people.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 8}By this the Holy Spirit is teaching that the way into the sanctuary was hidden, as long as the outer part of the tent still remained.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 9}For that was only a type, to continue down to the present time; and, in keeping with it, both gifts and sacrifices are offered, though incapable of satisfying the conscience of the worshiper;{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 10}the whole system being concerned only with food and drink and various ablutions \uc1\u8211* external ceremonials imposed until the coming of the new order.

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi360 
{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 11}But, when Christ came, he appeared as high priest of that better system which was established; and he entered through that nobler and more perfect tent, not made by human hands \uc1\u8211* that is to say, not a part of this present creation.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 12}Nor was it with the blood of goats and calves, but with his own blood, that he entered, once and for all, into the sanctuary, and obtained our eternal deliverance.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 13}For, if the blood of goats and bulls, and the sprinkling of the ashes of a heifer, purify those who have been defiled (as far as ceremonial purification goes),{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 14}how much more will the blood of the Christ, who, through his eternal Spirit, offered himself up to God, as a victim without blemish, purify our consciences from a lifeless formality, and fit us for the service of the living God!{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 15}And that is why he is the intermediary of a new covenant; in order that, as a death has taken place to effect a deliverance from the offences committed under the first covenant, those who have received the call may obtain the eternal inheritance promised to them.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 16}Whenever such a covenant as a will is in question, the death of the testator must of necessity be alleged.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 17}For such a covenant takes effect only on death, it does not come into force as long as the testator is alive.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 18}This explains why even the first covenant was not ratified without the shedding of blood.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 19}For, when every command had been announced to all the people by Moses in accordance with the Law, he took the blood of the calves and of the goats, with water, scarlet wool, and a bunch of hyssop, and sprinkled even the book of the Law, as well as all the people,{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 20}saying, as he did so \uc1\u8211* \uc1\u8216*This is the blood that renders valid the covenant which God has commanded to be made with you.\uc1\u8217*{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 21}And in the same way he also sprinkled with the blood the tent and all the things that were used in public worship.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 22}Indeed, under the Law, almost everything is purified with blood; and, unless blood is shed, no forgiveness is to be obtained.

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi360 
{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 23}While, then, it was necessary for the copies of the heavenly realities to be purified by such means as these, the heavenly realities themselves required better sacrifices.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 24}For it was not into a sanctuary made by human hands, which merely foreshadowed the true one, that Christ entered, but into heaven itself, so that he might now appear in the presence of God on our behalf.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 25}Nor yet was it to offer himself may times, as year after year the high priest entered the sanctuary with an offering of blood \uc1\u8211* but not his own blood;{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 26}for then Christ would have had to undergo death many times since the creation of the world. But now, once and for all, at the close of the age, he has appeared, in order to abolish sin by the sacrifice of himself.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 27}And, as it is ordained for people to die but once (death being followed by judgment),{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 28}so it is with the Christ. He was offered up once and for all, to bear away the sins of many; and the second time he will appear \uc1\u8211* but without any burden of sin \uc1\u8211* to those who are waiting for him, to bring salvation.

{\cf1\f1\fs22 11}Faith is the realisation of things hoped for \uc1\u8211* the proof of things not seen.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 2}And it was for faith that the people of old were renowned.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 3}Faith enables us to perceive that the universe was created at the bidding of God \uc1\u8211* so that we know that what we see was not made out of visible things.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 4}Faith made the sacrifice which Abel offered to God a better sacrifice than Cain\uc1\u8217*s, and won him renown as a righteous man, God himself establishing his renown by accepting his gifts; and it is by the example of his faith that Abel, though dead, still speaks.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 5}Faith led to Enoch\uc1\u8217*s removal from earth, so that he might not experience death. \uc1\u8220*He could not be found because God had removed him.\uc1\u8221* For, before his removal, he was renowned as having pleased God;{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 6}but without faith it is impossible to please him, for he who comes to God must believe that God exists, and that he rewards those who seek for him.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi360 
{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 7}It was faith that enabled Noah, after he had received the divine warning about what could not then be foreseen, to build, in reverent obedience, an ark in which to save his family. By his faith he condemned the world, and became possessed of that righteousness which follows on faith.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi360 
{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 8}It was faith that enabled Abraham to obey the call that he received, and to set out for the place which he was afterwards to obtain as his own; and he set out not knowing where he was going.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 9}It was faith that made him go to live as an emigrant in the promised land \uc1\u8211* as in a strange country \uc1\u8211* living there in tents with Isaac and Jacob, who shared the promise with him.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 10}For he was looking for the city with the sure foundations, whose architect and builder is God.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi360 
{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 11}Again, it was faith that enabled Sarah to conceive (though she was past the age for childbearing), because she felt sure that he who had given her the promise would not fail her.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 12}And so from one man \uc1\u8211* and that when his powers were dead \uc1\u8211* there sprang a people as numerous \uc1\u8220*as the stars in the heavens or the countless grains of sand on the shore.\uc1\u8221*

{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 13}All these died sustained by faith.

And therefore God was not ashamed to be called their God; indeed he had already prepared them a city.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 17}It was faith that enabled Abraham, when put to the test, to offer Isaac as a sacrifice \uc1\u8211* he who had received the promises offering up his only son,{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 18}of whom it had been said \uc1\u8211*

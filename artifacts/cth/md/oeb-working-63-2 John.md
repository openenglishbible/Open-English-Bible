John’s Second Letter
====================

[2 John 1]

##### Greetings #####

 [1:1] From the elder, to the lady chosen by God and her children. I truly love you all, and I am not the only one but all who know the truth love you as well. [1:2] We love you for the sake of the truth, which lives in us and will be with us forever.

 [1:3] Grace, mercy, and peace will be ours – the gift of God, the Father, and of Jesus Christ, the Father’s Son – in truth and love.

##### Live in truth and love #####

 [1:4] It was a great joy to me to find the lives of some of your children guided by the truth, in obedience to the command that we received from the Father. [1:5] And now I implore you, dear lady, let us love one another This is not a new command I am writing to you. It is the command we have had from the beginning. – Let us love one another. [1:6] And this is love – to live in obedience to the Father’s commands. This is the command as you learned from the beginning, to live a life of love. [1:7] I say this because many deceivers have gone out into the world – men who do not acknowledge that Jesus Christ came in flesh and blood. Any such person is a deceiver and antichrist. [1:8] Take care so that you do not lose what we have worked for but instead receive your full reward. [1:9] Anyone who goes beyond and fails to live inside of the teaching of Christ does not have God. The person who lives inside that teaching – they have both the Father and the Son. [1:10] If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not receive them into your house or even welcome them; [1:11] because the person who welcomes them is sharing with them in their evil work.

##### Final words #####

 [1:12] Though I have many other things to tell you, I would rather not use paper and ink. Instead I hope to come and see you, and to speak with you face to face, so that our joy may be complete. [1:13] The children of your sister, who is chosen by God, send you their greetings.% Open English Bible

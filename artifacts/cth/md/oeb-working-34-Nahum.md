[Nahum 1]

 [1:1] A message about Nineveh, a vision which came to Nahum from Elkosh.

##### God’s wrath #####

|   [1:2] The LORD  tolerates no rivals.
|     The LORD  is vengeful and fierce in wrath.
|   The LORD  does not fail to punish his foes;
|     the LORD  is vengeful against his enemies.
|   [1:3] The LORD  is slow to anger,
|     great in power.
|   The guilty will not escape
|     his punishment.

|   Storm tempest is his path
|     and cloud is the dust of his feet.
|   [1:4] He rebukes the sea and dries it up
|     and makes all the streams run dry.
|   Bashan and Carmel are languishing
|     and the bloom of Lebanon is withered.

|   [1:5] The mountains tremble before him
|     and the hills dissolve.
|   The earth heaves before him,
|     the world and all who live in it.

|   [1:6] Who can stand before his wrath?
|     Who can withstand the heat of his anger?
|   His fierce fury pours forth like fire,
|     he shatters rocks.

|   [1:7] The LORD  is good to those who hope in him,
|     a place of refuge in the day of trouble.

|   [1:8] With rushing flood an end he makes
|     of those who rise against him,
|   he drives his enemies into darkness.

|   [1:9] Why do you plot against the LORD ?
|     He will end you.
|     He only takes vengeance once.

|   [1:10] Thorns, tangled and drenched,
|     they are consumed like dry stubble.

|   [1:11] Nineveh! From you has arisen
|     one who plots evil against the LORD,
|     a counsellor of wickedness.

##### Good news for Judah #####

 [1:12] The LORD  says:

|   ‘Though they are many and strong,
|     they will pass away and be gone.
|   Though I have afflicted you,
|     I will afflict you no more,
|   [1:13] and now I will break his yoke from your necks
|     and snap your chains.’

 [1:14] The LORD  has given this command concerning you, Nineveh:

|   ‘Your name will no longer be remembered.
|   I will destroy every idol and image
|     in the house of your God.
|   I will destroy even your tomb,
|     for you are worthless.’

|   [1:15] Look! On the mountains a messenger
|     bringing good news,
|     announcing peace!
|   ‘Celebrate the feasts, Judah,
|     fulfil your vows.
|   Never again will these enemies invade your land,
|     they are destroyed!’

[Nahum 2]

##### Destruction of the city #####

|   [2:1]  Nineveh! The destroyer has come up against you;
|     mount guard upon the rampart;
|     watch the road; brace yourselves;
|     strengthen your might to the utmost.

|   [2:2] For the LORD  is restoring the majesty of Jacob
|     and of Israel,
|   though the devastators have plundered them
|     and destroyed their vines.

|   [2:3] The shields of his warriors are dyed red,
|     his soldiers are clothed in scarlet,
|   his chariots gleam like fire
|     on the day he prepares for battle
|     spears are shaken.

|   [2:4] Chariots rush across the fields,
|     storm through the squares;
|   they flame like torches,
|     they dart like lightening.

|   [2:5] A leader rallies his nobles,
|     they hurl themselves forward.
|   They speed on toward the wall;
|     the storming-shield is set up.

|   [2:6] The water-gates are thrown open,
|     and the palace dissolves in ruins.
|   [2:7] The queen is stripped,
|     she is carried off.
|   Her maids moan like doves,
|     beating upon their breasts.

|   [2:8] Like a pool of water is Nineveh,
|     her waters fast ebbing away.
|   ‘Stand firm! Stand firm!’ someone cries,
|     but no one turns back.

|   [2:9] ‘Loot the silver, loot the gold,
|     for there is no end to the treasure,
|     the wealth and precious things.’

|   [2:10] Nineveh is empty, desolate, devastated,
|     with faint heart and knocking knee.
|   There is weakness in every limb,
|     and faces grow pale.

|   [2:11] Where now is the den of lions?
|     Where now the lair of their young?
|   Where the lion used to withdraw,
|     with his cubs, with none to disturb them?

|   [2:12] The lion tore enough for his cubs,
|     and strangled prey for his lionesses.
|   He filled his caves with the kill,
|     he filled his lairs with fresh meat.

|   [2:13] ‘But see, I am against you,’
|     the LORD  of hosts declares,
|   ‘I will burn your chariots in smoke and fire.
|     The sword will devour your young lions.
|   You will never again prey on the land.
|     No more will your messengers be heard.’

[Nahum 3]

##### Ruin #####

|   [3:1] Woe to the bloody city!
|     Full of lies and plunder,
|     without end is the spoil.
|   [3:2] Hear the crack of the whip,
|     hear the rattle of wheels.
|   Galloping horses,
|     jolting chariots.
|   [3:3] Horsemen charging,
|     swords flashing,
|     spears glittering,
|   a multitude of slain,
|     a heap of bodies,
|   no end to the corpses
|     over which people stumble!

|   [3:4] ‘Because you acted like a prostitute,
|     bewitching the nations,
|     enticing the peoples,
|   [3:5] I am against you, Nineveh’
|     the LORD  of hosts declares.
|   ‘I will strip your clothes
|     and show the nations your nakedness,
|     and the kingdoms your shame.

|   [3:6] ‘I will fling loathsome filth at you,
|     and make you an object of contempt,
|     a spectacle,
|   [3:7] so that everyone who sees you
|     will flee from you and say:
|   “Nineveh is laid waste,
|     who will mourn for her?”

|   [3:8] ‘Are you any better than Thebes,
|     which stood on the banks of the Nile,
|   with waters around as a rampart,
|     whose wall was the sea of waters?
|   [3:9] Her strength was Ethiopia and Egypt.
|     The Libyans were her helpers,
|     and Put with its countless people.
|   [3:10] Yet she was exiled
|     and made captive.
|   On all corners of the streets
|     her infants were dashed to pieces.
|   Lots were cast for her nobles,
|     all her great ones were bound in chains.

|   [3:11] ‘You too, Nineveh, will be drunk with fear;
|     you too will seek a place of escape from the foe.
|   [3:12] All your fortresses are fig trees with the first ripe figs;
|     if shaken, they fall into the mouth of the eater!
|   [3:13] Your troops are weak as women before your foes;
|     the gates of your land are wide open;
|     your defenses burned down.

|   [3:14] ‘Draw water for the siege,
|     strengthen your forts.
|   Go to the clay pits and tread the clay;
|     take up the brick moulds.
|   [3:15] There the fire will consume you,
|     the sword will cut you down.

|   Multiply like the locust
|     or a swarm of grasshoppers.
|   [3:16] Increase the numbers of your merchants
|     until they are more than the stars of heaven,
|   [3:17] until your watchmen are locusts,
|     and your scribes like grasshoppers,
|     which swarm in the hedges on a cold day;
|   but when the sun rises
|     they fly away,
|     no one knows where.

|   [3:18] ‘King of Assyria:
|     your princes slumber,
|     your nobles sleep!
|   Your people are scattered on the mountains
|     with no one to gather them!
|   [3:19] There is no healing for your hurt,
|     your wound is incurable.
|   All who hear of your fate clap their hands in joy,
|     for who has escaped your limitless cruelty?’% Open English Bible

<span class="verse" rel="v037001002" id="001002" >2</span>
 The  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  of hosts says: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; The people say that the time has not yet come to rebuild the temple of the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v037001003" id="001003" >3</span>
 Then this message from the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  came to Haggai the prophet: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v037001004" id="001004" >4</span>
 Is it a time for you yourselves to live in your own well-roofed houses, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; while this temple lies in ruins? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v037001005" id="001005" >5</span>
 The  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  of hosts says: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Consider your past experiences. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v037001006" id="001006" >6</span>
 You sow much, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but bring in little; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; you eat, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but you do not have enough; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; you drink, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but are not filled; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; you clothe yourselves, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but not enough to be warm; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; and those who earn wages, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; put those wages in a bag with holes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v037001007" id="001007" >7</span>
 The  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  of hosts says: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Consider your experiences. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v037001008" id="001008" >8</span>
 Go up to the mountains, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and bring wood <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and rebuild the temple; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; then I will be pleased with it, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and I will reveal my glory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; The  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  says: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v037001009" id="001009" >9</span>
 You looked for much, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and it came to little; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; and when you brought the harvest home, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I blew it away. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Why? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; The  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  of hosts says: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Because my temple lies in ruins, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; while you shelter in your own houses. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v037001010" id="001010" >10</span>
 The heavens withhold the dew, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and the earth withholds its fruit, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v037001011" id="001011" >11</span>
 and I have called forth a drought upon the land <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and upon the mountains, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and upon the grain and the new wine and the oil <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and upon that which the ground brings forth, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and upon people and animals, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and upon all the labor of your hands. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v037001012" id="001012" >12</span>
 Then Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel and Joshua the son of Jehozadak the high priest, with all the rest of the people, obeyed the command of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  their God and the words of Haggai the prophet, as the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  their God had sent him to them. They showed proper respect for the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>. <br /><br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v037001013" id="001013" >13</span>
 Haggai, the prophet of the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, as the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  commanded him, told the people: “The  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  says: I am with you.” <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v037001014" id="001014" >14</span>
 And the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  stirred up the spirit of Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and the spirit of Joshua the son of Jehozadak the high priest, and the spirit of all the rest of the people, so that they came and worked on the temple of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  of hosts, their God, 
<span class="verse" rel="v037001015" id="001015" >15</span>
 in the twenty-fourth day of the sixth month. </p><h6>The future glory of the new Temple</h6><p> In the second year of Darius the king, <span class="chapter" id="002001">2</span> on the twenty-first day of the seventh month, this message from the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  came to Haggai the prophet, 
<span class="verse" rel="v037002002" id="002002" >2</span>
 telling him to speak to Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua, the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and to all the rest of the people: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v037002003" id="002003" >3</span>
 Who is left among you that saw this temple in its former glory? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And how do you see it now? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Doesn’t it seem as though there is nothing there? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v037002004" id="002004" >4</span>
 The  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  says: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet now be strong, Zerubbabel, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; be strong, Joshua, son of Jehozadak, the high priest, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; be strong, all you people of the land. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; The  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  says: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Begin the work, for I am with you. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; The  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  of hosts says: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v037002005" id="002005" >5</span>
 When your ancestors left Egypt I made a promise to you, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and I am still with you. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Do not be afraid! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v037002006" id="002006" >6</span>
 The  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  of hosts says: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; In a little while, I will shake the heavens, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and the earth, and the sea, and the land. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v037002007" id="002007" >7</span>
 And I will shake all nations, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and the precious things of all nations shall come here; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and I will fill this temple with glory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; The  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  of hosts says: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v037002008" id="002008" >8</span>
 The silver is mine, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and the gold is mine, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v037002009" id="002009" >9</span>
 The later glory of this temple <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shall be greater than the former. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; The  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  of hosts says: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; In this place I will grant prosperity. <br /><br /> This is the message of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  of hosts. </p><h6>Former displeasure and the new promise of blessings</h6><p>
<span class="verse" rel="v037002010" id="002010" >10</span>
 In the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month, in the second year of Darius, this message from the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  came to Haggai the prophet: 
<span class="verse" rel="v037002011" id="002011" >11</span>
 The  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  of hosts says: “Ask the priests for a ruling: 
<span class="verse" rel="v037002012" id="002012" >12</span>
 ‘If one carries consecrated meat in the fold of his garment, and with that garment touches bread, or stew, or wine, or oil, or any food, will it become holy?’” <br /><br /> And the priests answered: “No.” <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v037002013" id="002013" >13</span>
 Then said Haggai, “If one who is unclean by reason of a dead body touches any of these, will it be unclean?” <br /><br /> And the priests answered: “It would be unclean.” <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v037002014" id="002014" >14</span>
 Haggai replied: “So is this people and so is this nation before me, the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  declares, and so is every work of their hands; and that which they offer there is unclean. 
<span class="verse" rel="v037002015" id="002015" >15</span>
 Think back from this day, before a stone was laid upon a stone in the temple of the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>. 
<span class="verse" rel="v037002016" id="002016" >16</span>
 How were you? When you came to a heap of grain expecting twenty measures, there were only ten; when you came to the wine vat to draw out fifty vessels, there were only twenty. 
<span class="verse" rel="v037002017" id="002017" >17</span>
 ‘I struck all the work of your hands with blasting and blight, with mildew and with hail. Yet you didn’t turn to me,’ says the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, 
<span class="verse" rel="v037002018" id="002018" >18</span>
 ‘Think back from this day, think! From the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month, from the day when the foundations of the temple of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  were laid, and consider. 
<span class="verse" rel="v037002019" id="002019" >19</span>
 The seed is in the granary, but the vine and the fig tree and the pomegranate and the olive tree have not yet brought forth fruit. From this day will I bless you.’” </p><h6>Zerubbabel</h6><p>
<span class="verse" rel="v037002020" id="002020" >20</span>
 This message from the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  came to Haggai a second time on the twenty-fourth day of the month: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v037002021" id="002021" >21</span>
 Tell Zerubbabel, governor of Judah: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; I will shake the heavens and the earth; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v037002022" id="002022" >22</span>
 and I will overthrow the throne of kingdoms; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and I will destroy the strength of the kingdoms of the nations; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and I will overthrow the chariots, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and those who ride in them; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and the horses and their riders shall come down, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; each by the sword of his fellow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v037002023" id="002023" >23</span>
 In that day, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  of hosts says, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; I will take you, Zerubbabel, my servant, the son of Shealtiel, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  says, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; and will make you like a signet ring, for I have chosen you, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  of hosts says.

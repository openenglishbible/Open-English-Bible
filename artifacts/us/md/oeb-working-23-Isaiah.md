The Book of the Prophet Isaiah
==============================

### The Book of Judgment ###

#### Prophecies Concerning Judah and Israel ####

##### Jerusalem: her present sin and punishment; her future redemption and glory #####

[Isaiah 1]

 [1:1] The vision of Judah and Jerusalem, as seen by Isaiah the son of Amoz, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah.

###### The prophet’s lament over the unfaithfulness of the people to their God ######

|   [1:2] Hear, you heavens! Listen, earth,
|     for the LORD  is the speaker.
|   “I raised my childen and brought them up,
|     but they have rebelled against me.
|   [1:3] Even an ox knows its owner,
|     and a donkey its master’s manger;
|   but Israel does not know,
|     my people are thoughtless.”

|   [1:4] Sinful nation!
|     A people laden with guilt,
|   a brood of evildoers,
|     children all corrupt,
|   they have forsaken the LORD,
|     spurned the Holy One of Israel,
|     turned their backs on him.

|   [1:5] Why would you invite more beatings
|     by straying yet further from him?
|   Your whole head is sick,
|     your heart is all diseased,
|   [1:6] from the sole of the foot to the head
|     there is no health at all,
|   nothing but bruises and welts
|     and wounds that are raw and bleeding,
|   all unpressed and unbandaged,
|     all unsoftened with oil.

|   [1:7] Your land is a desolation,
|     your cities are burned with fire,
|   the fields before your eyes
|     are being devoured by foreigners.
|   [1:8] And the daughter of Zion is left
|     all alone like a booth in a vineyard,
|   a lodge in a cucumber field,
|     like a city under siege.
|   [1:9] Were it not that the LORD  of Hosts
|     had spared a few of us,
|   we would be like Sodom,
|     or another Gomorrah.

###### The futility of a merely ceremonial worship ######

|   [1:10] Attend to the LORD ’s message,
|     you rulers of Sodom!
|   Hear what our God has to teach you,
|     you folk of Gomorrah.
|   [1:11] “Why do you think I care,”
|     says the LORD,
|     “for your countless sacrifices?
|   I am sick of burnt offerings of rams
|     and the fat of fed steers,
|   blood of bulls, lambs, or goats,
|     is no pleasure to me.
|   [1:12] When you come before me in worship,
|     who has asked you for these things?
|   Trample my courts no more,
|     [1:13] bring offerings no more.
|   Your offerings are meaningless,
|     their incense disgusts me.
|   The new moon and Sabbath,
|     the call to assembly,
|   your sinful ceremonies
|     I cannot endure.
|   [1:14] I loathe your new moon festivals,
|     your annual assemblies.
|   They weigh me down,
|     I am tired of the burden.

|   [1:15] So when you lift up your hands,
|     I will turn away my eyes;
|   when you make your many prayers,
|     I will not listen to you.
|  Your hands are full of blood:
|     [1:16] wash, and make youself clean.
|   Banish out of my sight
|     the wicked things that you do.
|   Cease to do evil,
|     [1:17] learn to do good.
|   Seek justice,
|     help the oppressed,
|   uphold the rights of the orphan,
|     defend the cause of the widow.”

###### The great alternatives ######

|   [1:18] “Come,” says the LORD, “and now
|     let us reason together.
|   Your sins, though like scarlet, may yet
|     become white as the snow.
|   Though they be crimson-red,
|     they may yet be as wool.
|   [1:19] If you are obedient and willing,
|     you will eat the good of the land;
|   [1:20] but if you refuse and rebel,
|     by the sword you will be eaten,
|     for the mouth of the LORD  has spoken it.”

###### Zion’s present shame and future glory ######

|   [1:21] Alas! How the once faithful city
|     has become a prostitute.
|   She who was once full of justice,
|     where righteousness resided,q2 is now haunted by murderers.
|   [1:22] Your silver is now become dross,
|     and your wine mixed with water.
|   [1:23] Your rulers are grown to be rebels,
|     the companions of thieves -
|   every one of them fond of their bribe,
|     hunting ever for gifts,
|   caring nothing for the rights of the orphan
|     or the cause of the widow.

|   [1:24] This then says the Lord, GOD  of Hosts,
|     the Mighty One of Israel:
|   “I will get satisfaction from my foes,
|     wreck vengeance on my enemies.
|   [1:25] I will turn my hand against you,
|   I will melt you down and skim off your slag,
|     I will remove your impurities.

|   [1:26] I will give you good judges again
|     counsellors as you used to have,
|   and then you will called
|     the city of justice, the faithful city.

|   [1:27] Zion will be ransomed by justice,
|     and by righteousness her people.
|   [1:28] But rebels and sinners will be crushed,
|     and those who abandon the LORD  will perish.

###### The heathen cult and its doom ######

|   [1:29] The sacred oaks you delight in will bring you shame,
|     the gardens you worship in will make you blush.
|   [1:30] Like a tree with withered leaves
|     you will be - like a waterless garden.
|   [1:31] The strong will become like tinder,
|     their evil deeds the spark,
|   and both will burn together
|     and no one will quench the flame.

###### Jerusalem the centre of blessing to the world; arbitration, disarmament, and international peace ######

[Isaiah 2]

 [2:1] The message of Isaiah the son of Amoz: his vision of Judah and Jerusalem.

|   [2:2] In the after-time it will be
|     that the mountain of the LORD
|    will be set at the head of the mountains,
|     and exalted above the hills.
|   All the peoples will thither stream,
|   [2:3] many nations will go and say,
|   “Come, let us go to the mount of the LORD,
|     to the house of the God of Jacob,
|   so that he in his ways may instruct us,
|     and that we in his paths may walk.
|   For instruction proceeds from Zion,
|     the word of the LORD  from Jerusalem.”
|   [2:4] He will judge the disputes of the peoples,
|     and for manifold nations so justly will arbitrate
|   that their swords they will beat into ploughshares,
|     and to pruning-hooks their spears.
|   Nation will not lift up sword against nation,
|     and war they will learn no more.

|   [2:5] O household of Jacob, come,
|     let us walk in the light of the LORD .

##### Judgment upon the wealth and pride of Judah #####

###### The Lord’s judgement-day ######

|   [2:6] *(Get you into the caves of the rocks,
|     and hide in the holes of the ground,
|   from the LORD ’s dread face, when in glory majestic
|     he rises with terror to smile the earth.) *
|   For he has forsaken his people,
|     the household of Jacob.

|   Filled is his land from the east with diviners,
|     with soothsayers like to the Philistines,
|     sorcerers, children of foreigners.
|   [2:7] Filled in his land full of silver and gold,
|     and his treasure is endless.
|   Filled in his land full of horses,
|     his chariots are endless.
|   [2:8] Filled is his land full of idols,
|     he worships the work of his hands,
|     the things that his fingers have made.
|   [2:10] *(Get you into the rocks,
|     and hide in the ground,
|   from the LORD ’s dread presence
|     and glory majestic.) *
|   [2:11] So the pride of men will be humbled,
|     laid low will man’s loftiness be,
|     and that day will the LORD  alone be exalted.
|   [2:12] For a day of the LORD  is coming
|     upon all that is haughty and proud,
|     upon all that is lofty and high-
|   [2:13] upon cedars of Lebanon all,
|     and oaks of Bashan all,
|   [2:14] upon all the great mountains
|     and all the high hills,
|   [2:15] upon all the proud towers,
|     all fortified walls,
|   [2:16] upon all ships of Tarshish
|     and all gallant craft.
|   [2:17] *Then the pride of men will be humbled,
|     laid low will man’s loftiness be,
|   and that day will the LORD  alone be exalted.
|     [2:18] The Idols will all of them vanish.
|   [2:19] Get you into the caves of the rocks,
|     and the holes of the ground
|   from the LORD ’s dread face, when in glory majestic
|     he rises with terror to smile the earth. *
|   [2:20] That day will men cast away
|     to the moles and to the bats
|   their idols of silver and gold,
|     which they made for themselves to worship;
|   [2:21] *And into the caves of the rocks they will get them,
|     and into the rents of the cliffs,
|   from the LORD ’s dread face, when in glory majestic
|     he rises-with terror to smite the earth. *

 [2:22] Oh cease your trust in man, in whose nostrils is but a breath. Of what account is he?

###### A reign of anarchy ######

[Isaiah 3]

|   [3:1] Behold, the Lord the LORD  of Hosts
|     take staff and stay from Jerusalem and Judah-
|   [3:2] soldiers and Warriors, judges and prophets,
|   [3:3] deviners and elders, and captains of fifty,
|   men of distinction, and men of sage counsel,
|     cunning magicians and skilful enchanters.
|   [3:4] And boys I will give them for princes,
|     and men of caprice will rule over them.
|   [3:5] The people will play the tyrant,
|     each man over his neighbour.
|   The young will be rude to the aged,
|     the man of low rank to the high.

|   [3:6] One will take hold of his fellow, and say to him:
|     “Your family has a robe;
|   come, and do you be our ruler,
|     and take this ruin in hand.”
|   [3:7] Then will the other protest,
|     “No, truly: *I* cannot dress your wounds.
|   In my own house there is no bread,
|     nor yet is there a robe.
|   You will not thrust upon *me*
|     The leadership of the people.”

|   [3:8] Jerusalem is stumbling to ruin,
|     and Judah must surely fall;
|   for by word and by deed they defy the LORD,
|     provoking those glorious eyes of his.
|   [3:9] Their respecting of persons is witness against them;
|     like Sodom they publish their sin undisguisedly.
|     Woe unto them! They have wrought their own ruin.
|   [3:10] Happy righteous! For well they will fare,
|     they will reap the fruit of their doings.
|   [3:11] But woe to the wicked! For ill they will fare,
|     their deeds will be recompensed unto them.

|   [3:12] My people are cruelly governed,
|     extortions rule over them.
|   O My people, your leaders mislead,
|     and confuse the way you should go.
|   [3:13] The LORD  is taking his place for the trial,
|     he stands to judge his people.
|   [3:14] The LORD  summons to judgment
|     the elders and princes of his people.
|   “Yes, *you* have devoured the vineyard,
|     the spoil of the poor is in your houses.
|   [3:15] What mean you by crushing my people
|     and grinding the faces of the poor?”
|     says the Lord GOD  of Hosts.

###### The doom of the haughty women ######

|   [3:16] Moreover the LORD  said:
|     “Because Zion’s daughters are haughty,
|   walking with heads held high,
|     and eyes for ever ogling,
|   with dainty little steps,
|     and anklets ever jingling,
|   [3:17] the Lord will smite with a scab
|     the head of the daughters of Zion,
|     and their shame will the LORD  lay bare.
|   [3:18] That day the Lord will remove
|     the finery of the anklets,
|   the net-bands and the moons,
|     [3:19] the ear-drops and bracelets and veils,
|   [3:20] the head-dresses, armlets, and sashes,
|     the perfume-boxes and amulets,
|   [3:21] the signet-rings and the nose-rings,
|   [3:22] the state-gowns, the mantles, the shawls, and the satchels,
|   [3:23] the gauzes and linens, the turbans and veils.

|   [3:24] Sweet scents will give place unto stench,
|     and the girdle be changed for a rope.
|   And well-set hair will be bald,
|     and for elegant robe will be sackcloth,
|     for beauty the brand (of a slave).
|   [3:25] Your liegemen will fall by the sword,
|     and your mighty men in the battle.
|   [3:26] Her gates will lament and mourn,
|     as she lies despoiled on the ground.
|  

[Isaiah 4]

 [4:1] That day will seven women
|     take hold of one man and say,
|   “Our own bread will we eat,
|     and our rainment will we wear;
|   but oh, let us bear your name,
|     and take our reproach away.”

###### Zion’s final glory ######

|     [4:2] In that day

|   will the wild vegetation be glorious and fair,
|   and the fruit of the tilled land majestic and comely
|     for Israel’s sons who escape.
|   [4:3] And those who remain in Zion,
|     and those who are left in Jerusalem,
|   will be called by the name of holy -
|     all who stand in the book of life.
|   [4:4] When the Lord will have washed away
|     the filth of the daughters of Zion,
|   and rinsed away from her midst
|     the blood-stains of Jerusalem,
|   by means of the blast of judgment,
|     the blast of extermination,
|   [4:5] then will the LORD  come,
|     and o’er the whole site of mount Zion
|   and over all the glory
|     [4:6] will cover and canopy be –
|   a shade by day from the heat,
|     a refuge and shelter from storm and rain.

##### The vineyard with the wild grapes #####

###### The song of the vineyard ######

[Isaiah 5]

|   [5:1] A song will I sing of my friend,
|     a love-song touching his vineyard.
|   A vineyard belonged to my friend,
|     on a fertile hill-top he had set it.
|   [5:2] He dug it and cleared it of stones,
|     he planted in it choice vines.
|   He built in the middle a watchtower,
|     hewed a pit for pressing the grapes.
|   Then he looked for a yield of good grapes,
|     but the grapes that it yielded were wild.

|   [5:3] Now judge, you who dwell in Jerusalem,
|     and you who are freemen of Judah,
|     judge between me and my vineyard.
|   [5:4] What more could I do for my vineyard
|     that I had neglected to do?
|   And why, when I looked for good grapes,
|     did it yield only grapes that were wild?

|   [5:5] So now let me give you to know
|     what I purpose to do my vineyard.
|   I will tear off its hedge, that the beasts may devour it;
|     I will break through its wall, that they trample it down.
|   [5:6] I will make it waste, all unpruned and unweeded,
|     with thorns and with briars overgrown it will be,
|     and the clouds I will order to withhold from it rain.

|   [5:7] For the vineyard of the LORD  of Hosts is the household of Israel,
|     the freeman of Judah his cherished plantation.
|   But instead of the justice he looked for was bloodshed,
|     instead of the right was the cry (of the wronged).

###### The national sins: woe! ######

|   [5:8] Woe unto you who join house unto house
|     and who add one field to another,
|   till no one has room but you,
|     and you settle the land by yourselves.
|   [5:9] The LORD  of Hosts in my ear has whispered,
|   surely many a great fine house
|     will be desolate and empty,
|   [5:10] for ten acres of vineyard will yield but eight gallons,
|     and the harvest will be but one tenth of the seed.

|   [5:11] Woe unto them who rise early
|     to give themselves to drink,
|   and to those who sit late in the evening,
|     inflaming themselves with wine;
|   [5:12] whose banquets of wine are enlivened
|     with lute, harp, timbrel, and flute;
|   but all blind to the work of the LORD,
|     they see not the things he is doing.
|   [5:13] Therefore all unaware will my people
|     be swept into exile afar –
|   their nobleman dying of hunger,
|     their populace parched with thirst.

|   [5:14] Therefore Sheol with ravenous throat
|     opens wide her jaws without measure.
|   And down will her splendour go,
|     and her noisy tumultuous rabble,
|     with all who in her were exultant.
|   [5:16] Thus through judgment the LORD  of Hosts is exalted,
|     the holy God shows himself holy by righteousness.
|   [5:17] And there will lambs graze as at pasture,
|     and fatlings will feed in her ruins.

|   [5:18] Woe unto those who draw penalty on
|     by their sin, as by stout wagon-ropes drawn by oxen;
|   [5:19] who say, “Let him haste, let him act with speed,
|     in order that we may see it;
|   let the purpose of Israel’s Holy One come
|     so near that we recognize it.”

|   [5:20] Woe unto those who call evil good,
|     and good evil;
|   to those who turn light into darkness,
|     and darkness to light;
|   to those who turn sweet into bitter,
|     and bitter to sweet.

|   [5:21] Woe unto those who esteem themselves wise,
|     and who fancy themselves to be prudent.

|   [5:22] Woe unto those who are valiant in wine-drinking,
|     warriors brave at the mingling of drink;
|   [5:23] whom a bribe will induce to acquit the guilty,
|     and innocent men to deprive of their rights.

|   [5:24] As fire licks up the stubble,
|     and hay is shrivelled in flame,
|   so their root will turn to rottenness,
|     and their blossom go up in dust;
|   because they rejected the LORD ’s instruction,
|     and the message of Israel’s Holy One scorned.

###### A foreign army is coming ######

|   [5:25] So against his people his anger was kindled,
|     against them he stretched forth his hand and he smote them;
|   the mountains shook, and the dead
|     lay like refuse about the streets.
|   *For all this his anger is not turned back,
|     but his hand is stretched out still.*
|   [5:26] To a far-distant nation he raises his signal,
|     and whistles for them from the end of the earth.
|   See! Hastily, swiftly they come –
|   [5:27] none weary, none stumbling among them,
|     unsleeping and slumbering never:
|   the band of their loins never loosed,
|     the thong of their shoes never torn.
|   [5:28] Their arrows are sharp,
|     and their bows are all bent:
|   the hoofs of their horses are counted as flint,
|     and their wheels as the whirlwind.
|   [5:29] Their roar is like that of a lioness,
|     and like the young lions they roar,
|   growling and seizing the prey,
|     and bearing it far beyond rescue.
|   [5:30] That day they will roar over him,
|     with a roar like the roar of the sea:
|   when he looks on the earth, behold! Darkness,
|     the light has grown dark in the clouds.

##### The prophet’s call #####

[Isaiah 6]

 [6:1] In the year that King Uzi died, I had a vision of the Lord seated on a high and lofty throne, and [6:2] the skirts if his robe filled the Temple. Before him were standing seraphs, each with six wings – two for covering the face, two the loins, and two [6:3] to fly with; and thus they kept calling to one another:

|   “Holy, holy, holy, is the LORD  of Hosts;
|     the whole earth is filled with his glory.”

 [6:4] At the sound of their calling the foundations of threshold shook, and the House began to fill [6:5] with smoke. Then I said

|   “Woe is me, for I am undone;
|   for a man of unclean lips am I,
|     and I dwell in a nation of unclean lips;
|   and yet my eyes have seen
|     the king, the LORD  of Hosts.”

 [6:6] Then one of the seraphs flew to me with a live coal in his hand, which with tongs he had taken [6:7] from off the altar. With this he touched my mouth, and said,

|   “See, this has touched your lips:
|     your guilt is past and your sin forgiven.”

|   [6:8] Then I heard the voice of the Lord,
|     saying, “Whom should I send? Who will go for us?”
|     And I said, “Here am I, send me.”
|   [6:9] Then he said, “Go and say to this people
|   ’Hear ever, but understand never;
|     see ever, but comprehend never.’
|   [6:10] Make the people’s minds dull,
|     block their ears and cover their eyes,
|   lest they see with their eyes, lest they hear with their ears,
|     and their minds understand, and their health come again.”
|   [6:11] Then I said, “Till cities lie wasted,
|     with not an inhabitant left;
|   till houses hold men no more,
|     and the land is left a desolation;
|   [6:12] till the LORD  removes men afar
|     and wide tracts of the land lie forsaken.
|   [6:13] And should there be in it a tenth still left,
|     that too, in its turn, must be given to the fire,
|     like the stump of an oak or a terebinth felled.”

##### The crisis Created by the menace to Judah in 735 B.C. #####

###### The prophet’s word to the terrified king ######

[Isaiah 7]

 [7:1] In the days Ahaz, the son of Jotham, the son of Uzziah, Rezin King of Aram, and Pekah, the son of Remaliah, King of Israel, marched against Jerusalem to attack it, but they were unable to develop an actual assault upon it.

 [7:2] When news reached the Court that the Aramean army was on Ephraimite soil, the heart of Ahaz and his people shook like forest-trees before the [7:3] wind. Then the LORD  said to Isaiah, “Go out – you and your son Shear-yashub – to meet Ahaz at the end of the conduit of the upper pool on the [7:4] Fuller’s Field Road, and say to him: be careful to keep calm. Be not faint-hearted or afraid of this pair of fire-brands that are nothing but smoking stumps. Be not afraid of the fierce anger of Rezin [7:5] and Aram and the son of Remaliah. Aram and Ephraim with the son of Remaliah have indeed [7:6] plotted your ruin: their purpose is to invade Judah, and, after reducing her straits, to break into (Jerusalem); then, having overpowered her, they intend to set the son of Tabeel on the throne.

 [7:7] But thus says the Lord the GOD :

|   ’This thing will not succeed,
|   [7:8] for the head of Aram is Damascus,
|     and the head of Damascus is Rezin;
|   [7:9] the head of Ephraim is Samaria,
|     and the head of Samaria is the son of Remaliah.
|   Your faith must firmly hold,
|     if you would yourselves be held.’”

###### The great refusal and the sign ######

 [7:10] Once more I addressed Ahaz thus, “Ask the LORD [7:11]  your God for a sign – ask it (if you like) either from the depths of the underworld or from the heights above.” [7:12] “No,” replied Ahaz, “I will not ask for one. That would be equivalent to submitting the LORD  to a test.” [7:13] Then I said, “Hear then, you household of David. Is not enough for you to weary mortal men that you must weary my God as well? [7:14] you will have a sign therefore from the Lord himself. Behold!

|   A maid is with child, she will bring forth a son,
|     and will call his name Immanuel.
|   [7:15] Honey and curd he will eat,
|     when he knows how to choose what is good,
|     and to shun what is evil.
|   [7:16] For ere the child will know
|     how to choose what is good
|     and to shun what is evil,
|   that land will be deserted
|     whose two kings you so dreaded.

###### Judah will also be ravaged ######

|   [7:17] The LORD  will bring upon you your people
|     and on your father’s house
|   such days as have never yet been,
|     since Ephraim departed from Judah.
|   [7:18] That day it will come to pass
|   that the LORD  will whistle for the flies and the bees.
|   [7:19] They will come every one, and then down they
|     will settle
|   in the steep-walled ravines and in clefts of the rocks,
|     and on all thorn-hedges and places of pasture.

|   [7:20] That day will the Lord shave bare
|     with a razor that is hired
|     in the land beyond the River
|   both the head and hidden hair;
|     and the beard too will be snipped.
|   [7:21] And in that day will a man
|     keep but two sheep and a cow;
|   [7:22] yet the plenteous yield of milk
|     will supply him fare of curd.
|   For the fare of every man
|     who is left upon the land
|     will be nothing but curd and honey.
|   [7:23] And in that day every spot
|     where were once a thousand vines,
|   worth a thousand silver pieces,
|     will with thorns and briers be covered.
|   [7:24] With bow and with arrow will men come thither,
|     for all the land will be thorns and briers.
|   [7:25] Fear of thorns and briers will hold men afar
|     from the hills that used to be hoed with the hoe.
|     There cattle will wander and sheep will tread.

###### The fall of Damascus and Samaria ######

[Isaiah 8]

 [8:1] The LORD  said to me, “Take a large tablet, and write upon it in the common script ’Speed-spoil [8:2] Hurry-prey;’ and take (two) reliable witnesses, [8:3] Uriah the priest and Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah.” Then after the prophetess, through my approach to her, had conceived and borne a son, the LORD  said to me, “Call his name Speed-spoil Hurry-prey.

|   [8:4] For ere the child will know
|     how to cry ’My father! My mother!’
|   The wealth of Damascus, the spoil of Samaria,
|     will be carried away to the king of Assyria.”

###### The invasion of Judah ######

 [8:5] Once more I had a message from the LORD  – it was this:

|   [8:6] “Because this people has spurned
|     the gentle stream of Shiloah,
|   and melt with fear of Rezin
|     and the son of Remaliah,
|   [8:7] therefore, behold, the Lord
|     will speedily bring upon them
|   the waters of the Euphrates,
|     the great and mighty river.
|   It will rise above all its channels,
|     and overflow all its banks.
|   [8:8] On it will sweep over Judah,
|     an overflowing flood
|     that will reach as high as the neck.”
|   But (the LORD ’s) outstretched wings
|     will cover the breadth of the land;
|     for with us is God.

###### The futility of opposition to Judah ######

|   [8:9] you may storm as you will, you nations,
|     you will be shattered.
|   All you far-distant lands
|     of the earth, attend.
|   You may gird yourselves for the fray,
|     but you all will be shattered.
|   [8:10] You may forge your plans as you will,
|     they will all be confounded.
|   Be your resolves what they will,
|     they will not be accomplished;
|     for with us is God.

###### None is to be feared but the Lord ######

 [8:11] These were the LORD ’s words to me, as he grasped me with his hand and warned me not to walk in the ways of the people:

|   [8:12] “Call you not all a conspiracy
|     that this people calls conspiracy.
|     Share not their fears and their dreads.
|   [8:13] But the LORD  of Hosts – it is he 
|     you should count as the great conspirator.
|     Let him be your fear and your dread.
|   [8:14] A stone and a rock he will prove, whereon
|     both houses of Israel will strike and stumble –
|     a trap and a snare to the folk of Jerusalem.
|   [8:15] Many among them will stumble and fall,
|     will be broken and snared and taken.

###### Isaiah’s patient hope ######

 [8:16] I will seal my teaching and fasten my message [8:17] in (the heart of) my disciples. I will patiently wait for the LORD  who hides his face from the [8:18] household of Israel; I will set my hope in him. I myself and the children the LORD  has given me are in Israel as signs and symbols from the LORD  of Hosts whose home is on Mount Zion.

###### The awful plight of unbelieving Judah ######

 [8:19] When they tell you have recourse to ghosts and familiar spirits that chirp and mutter, ask them if a nation should not rather have recourse to its God. Why should they consult the dead on behalf [8:20] of the living? Assuredly they will (one day) clamour for the teaching and the message, when there is no daybreak for them any more.

|   [8:21] They will range through the land sore pressed and hungry,
|     and hunger will curse their king and their God.
|   [8:22] They will lift up their eyes to the heavens above,
|     they will look to the earth beneath;
|   but they will see nothing but distress and anguish,
|     and thick impenetrable gloom.

###### The great deliverance and the glorious king ######

[Isaiah 9]

 [9:1] In the former time he brought the territory of Zebulon and Naphtali into contempt, but in the latter time has he covered with glory the ground held by the nations beyond the Jordan on the way to the sea.

|   [9:2] The people who walked in darkness
|     have seen a glorious light:
|   those who dwelt in the land of gloom –
|     on them the light has shone.

|   [9:3] you have multiplied their gladness
|     and given them great joy:
|   the joy they made in your presence
|     was like the joy of harvest;
|   their gladness was like the gladness
|     of men who divide the spoil.

|   [9:4] For the yoke that pressed so heavy,
|     and the bar upon their shoulders,
|   and the rod of their taskmasters,
|     you have broken as on Midian’s day.

|   [9:5] Every boot of thundering warrior,
|     every war-cloak drenched with blood,
|   is destined for the burning,
|     will be fuel for the fire.

|   [9:6] For to us a child is born,
|     unto us a son is given,
|   on whose shoulder is dominion;
|     and this is the name he bears –

|   “Counsellor most wonderful,
|     god with the warrior might,
|   father everlasting,
|     prince of the reign of peace.”

|   [9:7] Great is the dominion
|     and endless is the peace,
|   upon the throne of David,
|     and over all his realm:

|   to establish and uphold it
|     in the righteousness and justice
|   from henceforth and for ever.
|     The zeal of the LORD  of Hosts
|     will bring this thing to pass.

##### The doom of Israel #####

|   [9:8] The Lord sent a word into Jacob,
|     on Israel it will alight
|   [9:9] With a power all the people will feel
|     in Ephraim and in Samaria.
|   They have stiffened their neck in pride,
|     in their stoutness of heart they have said:
|   [9:10] “The bricks are fallen down,
|     but now we will build with hewn stone.
|   The sycamores are cut down,
|     but with cedars we will replace them.”
|   [9:11] So against them the LORD  has stirred up their foes,
|     he has spurred their enemies on;
|   [9:12] Syrians east, and Philistines west,
|     have with open mouth devoured Israel.
|   *Yet for all this his anger is not turned back,
|     but his hand is stretched out still.*

|   [9:13] But the people turned not unto him who smote them,
|     nor did they resort to the LORD  of Hosts.
|   [9:14] So he cut off from Israel head and tail,
|     palm-branch and rush in a single day.
|   [9:15] The elders and men of repute are the head,
|     and the prophets whose teaching is false are the tail.
|   [9:16] Those who should lead this people mislead them,
|     and those whom they ought to have led are destroyed.
|   [9:17] The Lord will therefore not spare their youths,
|     on their orphans and widows he takes no pity
|   for each and all are profane and wicked,
|     and every mouth speaks impious folly.
|   *Yet for all this his anger is not turned back,
|     but his hand is stretched out still.*

|   [9:18] For wickedness blazed like a fire
|     that devours first thorns and briers,
|   then sets forest thickets aflame,
|     till they roll in columns of smoke.
|   [9:19] By the breath of the LORD  the land was scorched,
|     the people became like cannibals.
|   [9:20] They carved on the right, yet were hungry,
|     devoured on the left, unappeased;
|   no man did pity his fellow,
|     but each ate the flesh of his neighbour –
|   [9:21] Manasseh, Ephraim; and Ephraim, Manasseh;
|     and both against Judah together.
|   *Yet for all this his anger is not turned back,
|     but his hand is stretched out still.*

[Isaiah 10]

|   [10:1] Woe unto those who give mischievous verdicts,
|     elaborate scrolls that bring sorrow,
|   [10:2] by robbing the weak of their rights
|     and by plundering the poor of their due,
|   so that widows become their spoil,
|     and orphans fall a prey.
|   [10:3] But what will you do when called to account,
|     which will come like a crash from afar?
|   To whom will you flee for help,
|     and where will you leave your abundance,
|   [10:4] that you crouch not under the prisoners
|     or fall among the slain?
|   Yet for all this his anger is not turned back,
|     but his hand is stretched out still.

##### The doom of Assyria #####

###### The two plans – Assyria’s and the Lord’s ######

|   [10:5] Oh! Assyria! Rod of my anger,
|     and staff of my indignation!
|   [10:6] Against an impious people I send him,
|     a nation that sore has provoked me to wrath;
|   and I solemnly charge him to spoil and to plunder
|     and trample them down like the mire of the streets.
|   [10:7] Not such, however, *his* fancy,
|     nor such the thought of his heart;
|   but his thought is the utter destruction
|     of nations not a few.

|   [10:8] “Are my captains,” he says, “not all kings?
|     [10:9] Is not Calno’s fate like Carchemish,
|   and Hamath’s fate like Arpad’s,
|     and Samaria’s like Damascus?
|   [10:10] My hand has seized those kingdoms
|     with images more than Jerusalem’s;
|   [10:11] and will I not do to Jerusalem
|     and to her images also,
|   as I have done to Samaria
|     and to her idols also?

 [10:12] When the Lord has accomplished all his work on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem, he will punish the fruit of the stout heart of the king of Assyria and the glory of his lofty looks. For the Lord has said:

|   [10:13] By the strength of my hand have I done it,
|     and by my cunning discernment,
|   removing the bounds of the nations,
|     and plundering their treasures.
|   Like a strong bull I trample 
|     those sitting on thrones.
|   [10:14] I thrust my hand in the wealth
|     of the nations, as into a nest;
|   and all the earth have I gathered
|     as one gathers eggs that are left:
|   there was not a wing that fluttered,
|     none opened the mouth or chirped.”

|   [10:15] Could an axe boast over the man who wields it,
|     or saw treat with insolence him who handles it?
|   As if ever a rod could swing him who lifts it,
|     or staff of wood could brandish a man!

###### The fate of Assyria and Judah ######

|   [10:16] So into his fat will the Lord
|     GOD  of Hosts send leanness,
|   and under his splendour a burning
|     will burn like the burning of fire.
|   [10:17] That flaming fire is the Holy One,
|     he who is Israel’s light;
|   it will blaze and devour his thorns
|     and his briers in a single day.
|   [10:18] His glorious forest and gardens
|     will vanish, body and soul,
|     like a sick man pinning away;
|   [10:19] and his forest trees that are left
|     will be few, that a child may record them.

|   [10:20] That day it will come to pass,
|     that no more will the remnant of Jacob
|   or those who escape of the household of Israel
|     lean upon him who smote them:
|   they will loyally lean on the LORD,
|     the Holy One of Israel.
|   [10:21] A remnant will return,
|     a remnant of Jacob,
|     unto the mighty God.
|   [10:22] For though your people, O Israel,
|     be as many as the sand of the sea,
|     only the remnant of them will return.
|   Destruction is decreed,
|     breaking in like a flood of judgment.
|   For destruction, fixed and final,
|     the LORD  of Hosts will accomplish
|     in the midst of all the earth.

###### The consolation of Zion: Assyria will assuredly fall ######

|   [10:24] Therefore thus says the Lord the LORD,
|     “You my people who dwell in Zion,
|   be not afraid of Assyria,
|     who smites you with the sword,
|   and lifted this staff against you
|     as Egypt did not old.
|   [10:25] For yet a little while,
|     my fury will be spent,
|     and my anger will have an end.
|   [10:26] Over him will the LORD  brandish
|     a scourge like that which smote
|     upon median at Raven’s Rock.
|   And that rod of his over the sea –
|     he will lift it up once more
|     as he did against Egypt of old.
|   [10:27] His burden will pass from your shoulder,
|     his yoke press your neck no more.
|   From Rimmon he has gone up
|   [10:28] he has come as far as Ai,
|   through Migron he has passed,
|     he has stored his baggage at Michmash,
|   [10:29] he has gone across the pass,
|     he has bivouacked in Geber.
|   Raman is all a-tremble,
|     gibeah of Saul is in flight.
|   [10:30] You people of Gallim, shriek;
|     listen, O Laishah;
|   answer her, Anathoth;
|   [10:31] Madmenah takes to flight.
|   The people of Gebin seek refuge.
|   [10:32] This day he will halt at Nob.
|   He shakes his fist against
|     the mount of the daughter of Zion,
|     the hill of Jerusalem.

|   [10:33] But see! The Lord GOD  of Hosts
|     is lopping the branches with fearful crash;
|     and those who were lofty are now laid low.
|   [10:34] He strikes with his axe the wild thickets away,
|     and Lebanon’s glorious cedar are fallen.

##### The bliss of Israel in the latter days #####

###### The messianic king and kingdom ######

[Isaiah 11]

|   [11:1] There will come forth a shoot from the stock of Jesse,
|     and out of his roots will a branch sprout forth.
|   [11:2] The LORD ’s own spirit will rest upon him –
|     the spirit of wisdom and insight,
|   the spirit of counsel and might,
|     of the knowledge and fear of the LORD .
|   [11:3] He will not judge after the sight of his eyes,
|     nor decide by the words that are poured in his ears;
|   [11:4] but with justice he will deal with the cause of the helpless,
|     the case of the poor he will settle with equity.
|   With the rod of his mouth he will smite the tyrant,
|     and slay the unjust with the breath of his lips.
|   [11:5] His loins will be girt with the girdle of justice,
|     his waist will be bound with the circlet of faithfulness.

|   [11:6] The wolf will lodge with the lamb,
|     and the leopard lie down with the kid;
|   and the calf and the lion together will graze,
|     and a little child will lead them.
|   [11:7] The cow and the bear will be friends,
|     and their young ones will lie down together,
|     the lion will eat straw like the ox.
|   [11:8] The suckling will play o’er the hole of the asp,
|     and the weaned child trot in the lair of the viper.
|   [11:9] None will do hurt or havoc
|     on all my holy mountain:
|   for then will the earth be filled
|     with the knowledge of the LORD,
|     as the waters cover sea.

###### The triumphant return ######

|   [11:10] That day it will come to pass,
|   that the root of Jesse who stands
|     as ensign to the peoples –
|   to him will the nations resort,
|     and his resting-place will be glorious.
|   [11:11] That day will again lift his hand
|   to recover the rest of his folk
|     who are left in Assyria and Egypt,
|   in Pathros, in Cush, and in Elam,
|     in Shinar and Hamath and lands by the sea.
|   [11:12] He will raise for the nations a signal,
|     and gather the outcast of Israel,
|   and Judah’s dispersed will assemble
|     from all the four corners of earth.

|   [11:13] All envy of Ephraim will vanish,
|     cut off will be all who vex Judah.
|   No longer will Ephraim be jealous of Judah,
|     nor Judah be hostile of Ephraim.
|   [11:14] They will swoop down the slope of the Philistines westward,
|     and plunder together the sons of the East;
|   they will lay a stern hand upon Edom and Moab,
|     and bring to subjection the children of Ammon.
|   [11:15] The LORD  will also dry up
|     the tongue of the sea of Egypt;
|   with the fiery glow of his breath
|   he will swing his hand over the river,
|   and smite it to seven streams
|     such that men may go over in sandals.
|   [11:16] And such of his folk as are left
|     will return from Assyria on a highway
|   like that on which Israel trod
|     on the day he came up out of Egypt.

###### The song of thanksgiving ######

[Isaiah 12]

|   [12:1] In that day you will say,
|   “I give you thanks, O LORD ;
|     for though you were angry with me,
|   your anger is turned away
|     and you have comforted me.
|   [12:2] See! God is my salvation,
|     I trust him unafraid.
|   For my strength and my song is the LORD,
|     and he is become my salvation.”

|   [12:3] With joy you will draw water
|     from the fountains of salvation.
|   [12:4] And in that day you will say,
|     “Give thanks to the LORD  and call on his name.
|   Make known to the nations what things he has done,
|     record that his name is exalted on high.
|   [12:5] To the LORD  make music, for he has wrought proudly;
|     let this be made known through the length of the world.
|   Lift up your voices, you dwellers in Zion;
|     for great in your midst is the Holy One of Israel.”

#### Prophecies Concerning Foreign Nations ####

##### Prophecy concerning Babylon #####

###### The doom of Babylon ######

[Isaiah 13]

 [13:1] Oracle on Babylon: a vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz.

|   [13:2] On a bare height raise the signal,
|     and cry aloud to them.
|   Wave you the hand that they enter
|     the gates of those lordly men.
|   [13:3] I have myself commissioned
|     my consecrated servants
|     to execute my anger.
|   Yea, I have summoned my warriors,
|     my proudly exultant ones.
|   [13:4] Hark! On the hills a tumult
|     as of a mighty multitude.
|   Hark! It’s the roar of kingdoms,
|     of nations gathering together.
|   The LORD  of Hosts is mustering
|     his army for the battle.

|   [13:5] They come from a distant land,
|     from the uttermost end of heaven –
|   the LORD, with his weapons of wrath,
|     to ruin all the earth.
|   [13:6] Wail! For the day of the LORD  is nigh,
|     like destruction from God Almighty it comes.
|   [13:7] All hands will therefore hang helpless,
|     each mortal heart will melt,
|   [13:8] and men will be confounded.
|   Taken with throes and pangs,
|     they will writhe like a woman in travail.
|   They will look on each other astonished,
|     with faces all aflame.

|   [13:9] Behold! The LORD  comes,
|     with wrath and hot anger cruel,
|   to make earth a desolation
|     and destroy the sinners upon it.
|   [13:10] The heavens and their constellations
|     will not flash any light;
|   the sun will be dark when it rises,
|     no light of moon will shine.
|   [13:11] I will punish the world for its evil,
|     the godless for their guilt;
|   I will still the conceit of the arrogant,
|     the tyrant’s pride lay low.
|   [13:12] And men will be rarer than gold,
|     yea, mortals than gold of Ophir.

|   [13:13] The heavens will therefore tremble,
|     and the earth quake out of her place,
|   at the wrath of the LORD  of Hosts
|     in the day of the heat of his anger.
|   [13:14] And then, like a hunted gazelle,
|     or like sheep that have no one to fold them,
|   will each set his face to his people,
|     and each to his own land flee.
|   [13:15] Whoso is found will be stabbed,
|     by the sword he will fall who is caught.
|   [13:16] Their babes will be dashed in pieces
|     before their very eyes;
|   their houses will be plundered,
|     and ravished their wives will be.

|   [13:17] Behold! I already am stirring
|     the people of media against them:
|   no thought have they of silver,
|     no pleasure take they in gold.
|   [13:18] (They grasp their) bows (and spears,
|     fearful are they and cruel;
|   they will smite) the young men (all,
|     and the maids) will be dashed in pieces.
|   To the fruit of the womb they are ruthless,
|     and children they eye without pity.
|   [13:19] Thus Babylon, fairest of kingdoms,
|     the glory and pride of Chaldea,
|   will perish with doom like the doom
|     to which God hurled Gomorrah and Sodom.

|   [13:20] For ever she will be desolate,
|     tenantless age after age.
|   No nomad will pitch his tent there,
|     no shepherd will fold his flock there;
|   [13:21] but there will wild cats lie,
|     and their homes will be crowded with jackals.
|   And there will ostriches dwell,
|     and there will satyrs dance,
|   [13:22] hyenas will howl in her castles,
|     and wolves in her halls of delight.
|   Her time is wellnigh come,
|     her day lasts not much longer.

###### Song of triumph over the fall of Babylon’s king ######

[Isaiah 14]

 [14:1] For the LORD  will take pity on Jacob, he will elect Israel once more and settle them on their own land: resident foreigners will join them and attach themselves to the household [14:2] of Jacob. (Foreign) people will take them and bring them to their place; and the household of Israel will employ them in the LORD ’s land as men-servants and maid-servants, thus reducing their erstwhile captors to captivity, and lording it over those who had been their taskmasters.

 [14:3] Then, in the day that the LORD  gives you rest from your toil and turmoil and from the hard service that was [14:4] laid upon you, you will take up this taunt-song over the King of Babylon, and say:

|   how still the oppressor is grown!
|     How still is the insolent raging!
|   [14:5] The LORD  has broken the staff
|     of the godless, the sceptre of tyrants,
|   [14:6] who smote the peoples in fury
|     with unremitting stroke,
|   who trod down the nations in anger
|     with unrelenting tread.
|   [14:7] All earth is at rest, is quiet,
|     they break into happy cries.
|   [14:8] Yea, the fir-trees rejoice at they fate,
|     and the cedars of Lebanon, saying,
|   “Since you have been laid low,
|     no woodsman is come to destroy us.”

|   [14:9] Sheol beneath is a-quiver,
|     awaiting your arrival;
|   she rousted the shades to greet the –
|     all who were chieftains on earth.
|   All the kings of the nations
|     she bids arise from their thrones.
|   [14:10] All of them lift up their voices,
|     and thus they say unto you:
|   “So you, too, are feeble as we;
|     you are become like us.”
|   [14:11] your pomp has been brought down to Sheol –
|     the strumming of your lutes:
|   beneath you the maggots are spread,
|     your coverlet is worms.

|   [14:12] How are you fallen from heaven,
|     you radiant son of the morning!
|   How are you struck to the ground,
|     lying stiff, a corpse upon corpses.
|   [14:13] And you, you did say in your heart,
|     “Into heaven I will ascend;
|   I will set my throne on high
|     above the stars of God,
|   and sit on the sacred mountain
|     in the uttermost parts of the north.
|   [14:14] I will climb above the cloud-peaks,
|     and rival the Most High.”
|   [14:15] But down you are brought to Sheol,
|     to the very depths of the pit.

|   [14:16] They who see you will gaze and gaze,
|     they will ask with eyes intent,
|   “Is this the man who startled the earth
|     and sent tremors through her kingdoms?
|   [14:17] Who made the world like a desert,
|     and overthrew her cities;
|   who left not his prisoners free,
|     to return each man to his home?”
|   [14:18] Now in their honoured tombs
|     all the kings of the nations are lying;
|   [14:19] but you are cast forth, tombless,
|     like a hateful untimely birth,
|   clothed upon with the slain,
|     whose bodies the sword has pierced,
|   who go down to the floor of the pit,
|     like a carcase trodden under foot.
|   [14:20] You will not be joined unto them
|     in the place where they lie buried;
|   because you have ruined your land,
|     your people you have slaughtered.
|   May it never be named again –
|     the race of this evil-doer.
|   [14:21] Get ready the knife for his sons,
|     to atone for the guilt of their father;
|   lest they rise and posses the earth,
|     and fill the face of the world.

 [14:22] I will rise up against them, says the LORD  of Hosts, cut off from Babylon record and remnant, kith and kin, says the LORD . And I will make it a possession of the bittern, and pools of water; and I will sweep it with the besom of destruction, says the LORD  of Hosts.

##### The Lord’s invincible world-plan #####

 [14:24] The LORD  of Hosts has sworn this oath:

|   my plan will most surely be done,
|     and the thing that I purposed will stand.
|   [14:25] On the land that is mine I will shatter Assyria,
|     and trample him down on my mountains.
|   His yoke will oppress them no more,
|     and his burden will pass from their shoulders
|   [14:26] This is the purpose formed
|     to humble all the earth;
|   and this is the hand outstretched
|     against the nations all.
|   [14:27] For who can bring to nothing
|     what the LORD  of Hosts has planned?
|   And when his is the hand that is outstretched,
|     who can turn it back?

##### Warning to Philistia #####

 [14:28] In the year that King Ahaz died, came this oracle:

|   [14:29] Rejoice not, you Philistines all,
|     that the rod that has scourged you is broken;
|   for an asp from the root of the serpent will issue,
|     its fruit will be a fiery flying serpent.

|   [14:30] For the poor will feed on my meadows,
|     the needy will lie down secure;
|   but your seed I will kill with famine,
|     your remnant I will slay.

|   [14:31] Wail, you gates; and shriek, you cities:
|     melt with fear, you Philistines all.
|   For out of the north comes smoke (of war),
|     in the ranks of the foe will no straggler be found.
|   [14:32] What answer will (Judah) make
|     to the envoys of that nation?
|   That “the LORD  himself is the founder of Zion,
|     and there do his suffering people find refuge.”

##### Lament over Moab #####

[Isaiah 15]

 [15:1] Oracle on Moab

|   Alas! In a night has Ar-Moab
|     been wasted and ruined.
|   Alas! In a night has Kir-Moab
|     been wasted and ruined.
|     [15:2] Gone up is the daughter of Dibon
|     to weep on the heights;
|   on the summits of Nebo and medeba
|     Moab wails.
|   On every head there is baldness,
|     and beards are all shorn.
|   [15:3] On her streets they have girt them with sackcloth,
|     on roofs is lament;
|   on her squares, one and all they are wailing
|     with torrents of tears.
|   [15:4] Heshbon and Elealeh cry out,
|     and their cry reaches Jahaz;
|   whereat Moab’s loins fall a-quiver,
|     the soul of her quivers.
|   [15:5] My heart cruet out for Moab,
|     they flee towards Zoar;
|   they climb the ascent unto Luhith
|     and weep as they go;
|   they raise on the way to Horonaim
|     a cry of destruction.
|   [15:6] For ruin has clean overtaken
|     the waters of Nimrim;
|   the herbage is gone, the grass withered,
|     and verdure is none.

|   [15:7] So they bring o’er the Brook of the Willows
|     their riches and stores;
|   [15:8] for the cry (of despair) has gone round
|     all the borders of Moab;
|   the wail thereof reaches Eglaim,
|     it reaches Beer-elim.
|   [15:9] For the waters of Dimon are bloody.
|     Yet more will I bring upon Dimon –
|   a lion on those who escape
|     and are left out of Moab.

[Isaiah 16]

|   [16:1] Tribute of lambs they despatched
|     to the lord of the land,
|   from the Sela, by way of the wilderness,
|     unto Mount Zion.
|   [16:2] And then at the fords of the Arnon
|     the daughters of Moab
|   will flutter like birds, and will fly
|     as when nestlings are scattered.
|   [16:3] “Grant us the laid of you counsel,
|     and mediate (for us);
|   shelter us as in the noon-tide
|     with shade deep as night.
|   Bring into shelter the outcasts,
|     betray no the fugitives;
|   [16:4] suffer the outcasts of Moab
|     to dwell in your land.
|   Be you a shelter to them
|     from the face of the spoiler.”

|   When the ruthless are brought to an end,
|     and the spoiler has ceased;
|   when the heel of the tyrant has vanished
|     clean out of the land;
|   [16:5] then the throne will be established by kindness,
|     and on it will sit
|   in the tent of King David in faithfullness
|     one who will judge
|   with a spirit intent on the right
|     and on promptness of justice.
|   [16:6] We have heard of the pride of Moab,
|     the utterly proud –
|   of her haughty and insolent pride,
|     and her prating all baseless.
|   [16:7] So Moab for Moab is wailing,
|     she wails altogether;
|   yea, utterly stricken they moan
|     for the cakes of Kir-heres.
|   [16:8] The vine-tracts of Heshbon are withered,
|     the vineyards of Sabah,
|   whose choice red wine has laid low
|     many a lord of the nations.
|   Her cluster did stretch unto Jazer,
|     they strayed to the desert.
|   Her tendrils were spread far abroad,
|     they passed over the sea.

|   [16:9] So I share in the weeping of Jazer
|     for the vineyards of Sibmah;
|   I drench you with my tears,
|     O Heshbon and Elealeh:
|   for over your grapes and your vintage
|     the war-cry is fallen.
|   [16:10] From the land of gardens is vanished
|     all gladness and joy;
|   there resounds no cry in the vineyards,
|     no shout any more;
|   no wine in the presses is trodden,
|   the shouting is stilled.
|   [16:11] So my soul like a harp makes moaning for Moab,
|     and my heart for Kir-heres.
|   [16:12] When Moab appears on the heights
|     and makes herself weary,

##### Prophecy concerning Damascus and Northern Israel #####

###### The destruction of Damascus ######

[Isaiah 17]

 [17:1] Oracle on Damascus

|   See! Soon will Damascus no more be a city,
|     but only ruin, forsaken for ever.
|   [17:2] To the grazing of flocks will her cities be given,
|     and there will they lie, with not one to affright them.
|   [17:3] The fortress will vanish from Ephraim,
|     and the dynasty from Damascus.
|   The remnant of Aram will perish,
|     their fate will be Israel’s fate,
|     says the LORD  of Hosts.

###### The doom of Israel ######

|   [17:4] That day it will come to pass
|   that the glory of Jacob will pale,
|     and the fat of his flesh will be wasted;
|   [17:5] or like gleanings it will be,
|     when a reaper gathers the corn,
|   and his arm reaps the ears –
|     the ears of corn that are gleaned
|     in the valley of Rephaim;
|   [17:6] or the gleanings that are left
|     when an olive-tree has been beaten –
|   a berry or two on the uppermost branch,
|     four of five on the boughs of a fruit tree:
|     thus says the LORD, the God of Israel.
|   [17:7] In that day men will look to their maker,
|     and turn their eyes unto Israel’s Holy One;
|   [17:8] not to the work of their hands will they look,
|     nor to things that their fingers have made will they turn.
|   [17:9] That day will your cities deserted be
|     like the derelict cities of Hivite and Amorite.
|   [17:10] Because you forgot the God who had helped you,
|     and did not remember the rock of your refuge;
|   though you planted Adonis’ gardens,
|     and stocked them with foreign slips;
|   [17:11] though you fence them the day they are set,
|     and next morn bring your seedlings to blossom:
|   your harvest will vanish away
|     in the day of your sickness and desperate pain.

##### The speedy doom of the Assyrians #####

###### Their sudden destruction ######

|   [17:12] Ha!
|   The uproar of peoples many!
|     They roar like the roar of the sea:
|   the thunder of mighty nations,
|     they thunder as ocean thunders.
|   [17:13] But the LORD  will rebuke them,
|     and far they will flee, pursued
|   like chaff on the hills before wind,
|     or like dust in the face of the hurricane.
|   [17:14] At even-tide, lo! Terror:
|     ere morning they are gone.
|   Such is the fate of those who despoil us,
|     the lot of those who plunder us.

###### Isaiah’s answer to the Ethiopian ambassadors ######

[Isaiah 18]

|   [18:1] Ah, land of the buzzing of wings
|     beyond the rivers of Cush,
|   [18:2] that despatches ambassadors over the sea
|     in vessels of reed on the face of the waters.
|   “Depart, you messengers fleet,
|     to your tall and bronze-skinned people,
|     whose land is divided by rivers –
|   your nation strong and victorious,
|     dreaded both near and far.
|   [18:3] All you who inhabit the world,
|     and dwell upon the earth:
|   when a signal is raised, beware,
|     and hark, when the trumpet is blown.

|   [18:4] For thus says the LORD  to me,
|     ’From my place I watch untroubled,
|   still as shimmering heat in sunshine,
|     or dew-clouds in time of harvest.’
|   [18:5] For before the harvest, when blossom is over,
|     and the berry becomes a ripening grape,
|   he will lop off the branches with pruning-hooks,
|     he will server the tendrils and cast them away.
|   [18:6] They will all be left to the beasts of the land,
|     to the ravenous birds that haunt the mountains;
|   all summer the ravenous birds will devour them,
|     all winter the beasts of the land will consume them.”

 [18:7] At that time will a gift of homage be brought to the LORD  of Hosts from that tall and bronze-skinned people, whose land is divided by rivers – that nation strong and victorious, dreaded near and far – to Mount Zion, the place of the name of the LORD  of Hosts.

##### The destiny of Egypt #####

###### The disaster of Egypt ######

 Oracle on Egypt

[Isaiah 19]

|   [19:1] Behold! On swift cloud riding
|     the LORD  is coming to Egypt:
|   the idols of Egypt will quake at his presence,
|     the heart of Egypt will melt within her.

|   [19:2] I will spur on Egypt to fight against Egypt,
|     brother with brother, and neighbour with neighbour,
|     city with city, and kingdom with kingdom.

|   [19:3] Then will Egypt be drained of the spirit within her,
|     and I will confound her counsels:
|   to idols and muttering wraiths they will seek,
|     to ghosts and familiar spirits.

|   [19:4] And I will deliver Egypt
|     into a stern lord’s hands;
|   a king who is fierce will rule over her,
|     says the Lord the LORD  of Hosts.

|   [19:5] And the sea will be drained of its water,
|     the river be parched and dry;
|   [19:6] its branches will dwindle and stink,
|     and the arms of the Nile will be parched.
|   Reeds and rushes will wither,
|     [19:7] the sedge on its brink will shrivel;
|   and all that is sown by the Nile
|     will be withered and whirled into nothing.

|   [19:8] The fishers mourn and lament,
|     who cast their hook in the Nile;
|   and all the spread their nets
|     on the face of the waters will languish.

|   [19:9] The workers in flax will be shamed,
|     the combers and weavers of white stuff;
|   [19:10] the weavers of cloth will be crushed,
|     and the workers for hire will be sorrowful.

|   [19:11] Sheer fools are the princes of Zoan;
|     the wisest of Pharaoh’s counsellors
|     prove but a witless council.
|   How then can you say unto Pharaoh,
|     “A son of the wise am I,
|     a son of ancient kings”?

|   [19:12] Where are your wise men, then?
|     Let them, pray, declare unto you,
|   and make known what the LORD  of Hosts
|     has purposed to do unto Egypt.

|   [19:13] Befooled are the princes of Zoan,
|     deceived are the princes of memphis;
|   the chieftains of her tribes
|     have led Egypt all astray.

|   [19:14] The LORD  has mingled within them
|     the spirit of clouded judgment;
|   and so they led Egypt astray
|     in all her enterprise,
|     as a drunkard strays in his vomit.

|   [19:15] Thus head, tail, palm-branch and rush,
|     will nothing accomplish for Egypt.

###### The conversion of Egypt ######

 [19:16] In that day will Egypt fear and tremble like a woman, at the hand which the LORD  of Hosts [19:17] will swing over her. The land of Judah will be a terror to her; the very mention of the name will fill her with dread at the thought of the purpose which the LORD  of Hosts has formed against her.

 [19:18] In that day there will be in the land of Egypt five cities speaking the language of Canaan, and swearing allegiance to the LORD  of Hosts; and one of them will be called the City of the Sun.

 [19:19] In that day there will be an altar to the LORD  in the heart of the land of Egypt, and a pillar to [19:20] the LORD  at the border. It will be a sign and a witness to the LORD  of Hosts in the land of Egypt: for when, under oppression, they cry to the LORD  to send a deliver, he will intervene and rescue [19:21] them. And the LORD  will reveal himself to the Egyptians, and the Egyptians will acknowledge the LORD  on that day: they will worship him with sacrifice and offering, they will make vows to the LORD  and discharge them. The LORD  will smite [19:22] Egypt – smite and heal her: when they turn to the LORD, he will heal them in answer to their entreaty.

 [19:23] In that day there will be a highway between Egypt and Assyria. Assyrians will come to Egypt, and Egyptians to Assyria: Egyptians and Assyrians will worship (the LORD ) in common. [19:24] In that day Israel will join Egypt and Assyria in a triple alliance, and so bring blessing to the world [19:25] around, which the LORD  of Hosts has in these words blessed: “Blessed be Egypt my people, and Assyria the work of my hands, and Israel my inheritance.”

##### Warning against the folly of an alliance with Egypt #####

[Isaiah 20]

 [20:1] At that time Isaiah the son of Amoz received a message from the LORD, bidding him go and take the sackcloth from his loins and the sandals from his feet; and this he did, going about without [20:2] mantle or shoe. Then in the year that the Tartan, who had been despatched by Sargon King of Assyria, [20:3] came to Ashdod and took it by storm, the LORD  said, “Just as my servant Isaiah has gone for three years without mantle of shoe for a sign and a symbol to [20:4] Egypt and Ethiopia, so will the captives of Egypt and the exiles of Ethiopia, young and old, be led away by the King of Assyria – without mantle or [20:5] shoe, and with buttocks exposed. Then those who had looked with hope to Ethiopia and made their boast of Egypt, will be put to shame and dismay. [20:6] And in that day the people who live in the coast-land will say, ’If this be the fate of those to whom we had fled in expectation of help and deliverance from the King of Assyria, how can *we* escape?”

##### The fall of Babylon #####

###### The fall of Babylon: its consequences for Judah ######

[Isaiah 21]

 [21:1] Oracle on the Wilderness

|   Like the roar of the whirlwind
|     that sweeps through the southland,
|   it comes from the desert,
|     that land of dread.
|   [21:2] A vision full stern
|     has been told unto me:
|   the robber still robs,
|     the spoiler still spoils.
|   “Go up, O Elam;
|     O media, lay siege:
|   all the sighs of the crushed
|     have I brought to an end.”

|   [21:3] For this cause my loins
|     are filled with anguish;
|   with pangs am I seized
|     like a woman in travail.
|   I writhe with the message,
|     the vision confounds me.
|   [21:4] My mind goes a-wandering,
|     horror appals me;
|   the twilight I love
|     has been turned into trembling.
|   [21:5] The tables are ready,
|     the carpets are spread,
|     they are eating and drinking.
|   Arise, you princes,
|     spread oil on the shields.
|   [21:6] For on this wise the Lord
|     has spoken to me:
|   “Go, station a watchman
|     to tell what he sees.
|   [21:7] If he sees a troop,
|     horsemen in pairs,
|   a train of asses,
|     a train of camels,
|   then let him give heed:
|     with most diligent heed.”

|   [21:8] And the watchman cried,
|   “On the watch-tower, O Lord,
|     do I stand all the day;
|   at my post am I stationed
|     the live-long night.

|   [21:9] Lo! A troop I see coming,
|     of horsemen in pairs.”
|   And he uttered these words,
|     “Fallen, fallen is Babylon:
|   down to the ground
|     fall her images shattered.”

|   [21:10] you my folk who were threshed
|     like the corn of the floor,
|   I have told you my message
|     from Israel’s God,
|     from the LORD  of Hosts.

###### The fall of Babylon: its consequences for the trading tribes of the desert! ######

 [21:11] Oracle of Edom

|   One calls to me out of Seir,
|     “Watchman, how late in the night?
|     “Watchman, how late in the night?”
|   [21:12] The watchman made answer,
|   “The morning approached,
|     but still it is night.
|   If you would enquire,
|     come hither again.”

 [21:13] Oracle “in the steppe”

|   In the bush, in the steppe, you must lodge for the night,
|     you caravans of Dedan.
|   [21:14] You dwellers in Temas’s land,
|   bring water to meet the thirsty,
|     and offer the fugitives bread.
|   [21:15] For before the sword they are fled,
|     before the whetted sword,
|   before the bow that is bent,
|     before the press of battle.

 [21:16] For thus has the Lord said unto me, “Within a year, no more and no less, will all the glory of [21:17] Kadar be at an end; and few will remain of the mighty archers of the Kedareness. The LORD  the God of Israel has decreed it.”

##### Judah’s unpardonable sin #####

[Isaiah 22]

 [22:1] Oracle on the Valley of Vision

|   What mean you that you are gone up,
|     one and all, to the house-tops,
|   [22:2] O town filled with uproar and tumult,
|     O city exultant?
|   your slain are not slain with sword,
|     neither fallen in battle.
|   [22:3] Your chieftains are all fled together
|     who wielded the bow,
|   and your strong men are all taken prisoners,
|     though far they had fled.
|   [22:4] “Turn away from me,” therefore I say,
|     “Bitter tears would I shed.
|   Urge not upon me your comfort,
|     my people are ruined.”

|   [22:5] For a day of confusion and trampling and tumult,
|     does come from the Lord, the LORD  of Hosts.
|   They tear down the wall in the Valley of Hanno,
|     the war-cry ascends to the mountains.
|   [22:6] Elam seized the quiver,
|     and Aram came riding on horses.
|   Kir uncovered the shield,
|     [22:7] your choicest of valleys was crowded
|   with chariots and horsemen,
|     arrayed for assault on the gate.
|   [22:8] Then you looked to the arms in the House of the
|     Forest,
|   [22:9] you had eyes for the gaps in the Fortress of
|     David;
|   [22:11] but you looked not to him who was doing all this,
|     you had no eyes for him who had planned it of old.
|   [22:12] So the Lord, GOD  of Hosts, has called you
|     to weeping and mourning, to baldness and sackcloth.
|   [22:13] But see! There is nothing but mirth and rejoicing,
|     slaying of oxen and killing of sheep,
|     eating of meat and drinking of wine –
|   eating and drinking, “because” (as you say)
|     “we may haply be dead men tomorrow.”
|   [22:14] The LORD  of Hosts has declared in my ear,
|     “This sin will assuredly never be purged
|     till you die” – says the Lord, GOD  of Hosts.

##### Personal threats and promises #####

###### The doom of Sheba ######

|   [22:15] Against Shebna, the Governor of the Palace.
|   Thus says the Lord GOD ,
|     go, get you yonder perfect (and say),
|   [22:16] “What right have you here, and what kin have you here,
|     that you hew you here a sepulchre –
|   that here on the height you do hew you a sepulchre,
|     carving a home for yourself on the rock?
|   [22:17] Behold, the LORD  will firmly enwrap you,
|     and wind you and wind you around and around:
|   [22:18] he will hurl you and hurl you afar like a ball,
|   mighty man that you are, to a spacious land.
|   Thither your glorious chariots will follow,
|     and there you will die,
|     you disgrace of the house of your lord.

###### The exaltation of Eliakim ######

|   [22:19] I will thrust you from your office,
|     and tear you down from your post.
|   [22:20] That day will I summon my servant,
|     Eliakim, son of Hilkiah.
|   [22:21] I will put your mantle upon him,
|     and give your authority into this hand.
|   And a father he will be
|     to the folk of Jerusalem and the household of
|     Judah.
|   [22:22] I will lay upon his shoulder
|     they key of the house of David,
|   so that none may shut when he opens,
|     nor open when he shuts.
|   [22:23] I will fasten him securely,
|     like a nail in a place that is firm.
|   Through him will his father’s house
|     be lifted to seats of honour.”

###### The downfall of Eliakim’s family ######

 [22:24] his family will hang upon him with all their weight – off-spring and off-scourings, all the meaner sort of vessels, be they bowls or be they pitchers. [22:25] In that day, says the LORD  of Hosts, will the nail so firmly fastened be removed with a wrench, and down will come in ruin all that had hung upon it: for the LORD  of Hosts has spoken it.

|     your haven is ruined.
|   On your way from the island of Cyprus
|     the tale has been told you.
|   [23:2] The folk of the coast-land are perished,
|     the merchants of Sidon,
|   who traversed the sea, and whose envoys
|     did sail many waters,
|   [23:3] whose harvest was wheat from the Nile,
|     and whose revenue trade with the nations.
|   [23:4] O Sidon, you mother of cities,
|     you stronghold of ocean,
|     in shame take up this lament:
|   “The youths who with anguish I bore and brought up
|     and the maidens I reared, are no more.”
|   [23:5] When tidings are come unto Egypt –
|     the tidings of Tyre –
|     in sore pain they will be.

|   [23:6] Pass over to Tarshish, and wail,
|     you who dwell on the coast-land.
|   [23:7] Is this your jubilant city,
|     which dates from of old,
|   whose feet in the olden time bore her
|     to settle afar?
|   [23:8] Who then has purposed this doom
|     against Tyre, the crowned queen,
|   whose merchants and traders were princes,
|     most honoured of earth?
|   [23:9] It’s the LORD  of Hosts who has planned it,
|     to desecrate pride,
|   to bring to contempt all splendour,
|     all pomp of the earth.

|   [23:10] Lament, you ships of Tarshish,
|     your haven is gone.
|   [23:11] He has stretched out his hand o’er the sea,
|     he has shaken the kingdoms.
|   The LORD  has charged touching Canaan
|     to ruin her fortresses.
|   [23:12] Exult no more, you are ruined,
|     O daughter of Sidon.
|   Arise, and pass over to Cyprus –
|     there, too, you will rest not.
|   [23:14] Howl, you ships of Tarshish,
|     your haven is ruined.

###### The revival of Tyre ######

 [23:15] In that day Tyre will pass into oblivion for seventy years, covering the period of one dynasty. At the end of seventy years, Tyre will fare like the harlot in the song:

|   [23:16] With lyre in hand, walk up and down the city,
|     harlot, forgot by all:
|   play skilfully, and sing them many ditty,
|     that they may you recall.

 [23:17] But at the end of seventy years the LORD  will visit Tyre (with favour). She will resume her meretricious practices, selling herself to all the kingdoms of the [23:18] world on the face of the earth. But her gains from this traffic will be dedicated to the LORD : they will not be stored or hoarded, but they are to belong to those who dwell in the LORD ’s presence; and these are to be furnished there from with abundance of food and stately apparel.

#### The great world-judgment ####

##### The judgment: the rebels punished #####

[Isaiah 24]

|   [24:1] Hark! Soon will the LORD  empty
|     and desolate the earth.
|   Her semblance he will distort,
|     her inhabitants he will scatter.
|   [24:2] Then the priest will fare as the plain man,
|     the master will fare as the servant,
|     the mistress as the maid.
|   The seller will fare as the buyer,
|     the borrower will fare as the lender,
|     the creditor as the debtor.
|   [24:3] The earth will be utterly emptied,
|     the world will be utterly spoiled,
|     for the LORD  has so decreed.

|   [24:4] The earth mourns and withers,
|     the world languishes and withers,
|     high heaven, like earth, languishes.
|   [24:5] The earth is all polluted
|     beneath the people who tread it;
|   for law they have transgressed,
|     and statue overstepped,
|     they have broken the eternal covenant.
|   [24:6] So a curse has devoured the earth,
|     it lights on her guilty people;
|   the people of earth are scorched,
|     and few are the men who are left.
|   [24:7] The new wine mourns, the wine languishes,
|     all merry hearts are sighing,
|   [24:8] hushed is the mirth of the timbrel,
|     the tumult of gladness is silent,
|     the mirth of the lute is hushed.
|   [24:9] No more is there drinking of wine with singing,
|     strong drink is bitter to those who drink it.
|   [24:10] The city of chaos is shattered,
|     the houses are bolted and barred,
|   [24:11] Over the land is an outcry for wine
|     all merriment is over,
|     and gladness is vanished from earth.
|   [24:12] Desolation is left in the city,
|     the gates are battered to ruins.

|   [24:13] Few in the midst of the earth
|     will be those who are left of the nations –
|   few as the olives when beaten,
|     or grapes when the vintage is past.
|   [24:14] Yonder they lift their voices
|     in ringing shouts of joy;
|   to the glorious the LORD
|      they cry from over the sea.
|   [24:15] “Now then you folk of the east,
|     give glory to the LORD,
|   and you in the isles of the sea,
|     to the name of Israel’s God.”
|   [24:16] From the uttermost parts of the earth
|     there float to us songs of praise:
|   “Now glory has dawned for the righteous.”

|   “Ah misery, misery me,” said I,
|     “For the robbers are robbing and robbing still.”
|   [24:17] Trap, terror, and pit are before you,
|     all you who dwell on the earth.
|   [24:18] He who flies from the terror will fall down the pit,
|     he who creeps from the pit will be caught in the trap.
|   For the windows of heaven are opened,
|     and earth’s foundations tremble.
|   [24:19] The earth is breaking asunder,
|     the earth is splitting asunder,
|     the earth is shaking asunder,
|   [24:20] the earth like a drunkard is reeling,
|     she sways to and fro like a hammock;
|   so heavy a guilt lies upon her –
|     she falls, to rise no more.

|   [24:21] That day the LORD  will punish
|   the host of high heaven in the height,
|     and the kings of the earth on the earth.
|   [24:22] And they will be swept to a dungeon, like prisoners,
|     and pent in the prison long time they will lie,
|     till the day of their punishment dawns.
|   [24:23] Then the moon will veil her face,
|     and the sun will hide in shame;
|   for the LORD  of Hosts, enthroned
|     in Jerusalem on Mount Zion,
|   will manifest his glory
|     in the presence of his elders.

##### The banquet of the nations on Mount Zion. #####

[Isaiah 25]

|   [25:6] On this mountain the LORD  of Hosts
|     will prepare for all the nations
|   a feast of pieces fat,
|     a feast of wine on the lees –
|   fat pieces full of marrow,
|     and wine on the lees well strained.
|   [25:7] He will rend on this mountain the veil
|     that enwrapped the face of all nations.
|   [25:8] He will swallow up death for ever.
|   And then will swallow up death for ever.
|   And then will the Lord GOD
|      wipe tears from every face,
|   and remove from off the earth
|     the reproach that has clung to his people.
|     The LORD  himself has decreed it.

##### Israel’s security in the great world-judgment #####

[Isaiah 26]

|   [26:20] O people of mine, come, enter your chambers,
|     and shut your doors behind you;
|   and hide you but for a moment,
|     till the wrath be overpast.
|   [26:21] For the LORD, behold, comes forth from his place,
|     to punish the dwellers on earth for their guilt;
|   and the earth will disclose her blood,
|     she will cover her slain no more.

[Isaiah 27]

|   [27:1] When that comes, the LORD  will punish,
|     with his fierce and great and mighty sword,
|   leviathan the fleeing serpent,
|     and leviathan the coiled serpent,
|     and the great sea-monster he will slay.
|   [27:12] That day will the LORD  beat out the grain
|     from the river Euphrates to the torrent of Egypt,
|   and *you* will be gleaned, one by one, sons of Israel.
|   [27:13] That day, at the blast of a mighty trumpet,
|   the men who were lost in the land of Assyria,
|     and those who were outcast in Egypt’s land,
|   will come and bow down to the LORD  in worship
|     on the holy Mount in Jerusalem.

##### Song of thanksgiving over the destruction of some proud city #####

[Isaiah 25]

|   [25:1] The LORD, you are my God;
|     I exalt you, I praise your name:
|   for a marvellous thing you have done,
|     long purposed, now come to fulfilment.
|   [25:2] You have made of a city a heap,
|     of a fortified city a ruin;
|   the palace of pride is a city no more,
|     it will not be rebuilt for ever.
|   [25:3] For this will fierce nations own your glory,
|     the city of tyrants will fear you.
|   [25:4] For unto the weak you have proved you a stronghold,
|   a stronghold were you to the poor in his straits –
|   a refuge from storm and a shadow from heat.
|   [25:5] You subdued the voice of the proud,
|     and you humbled the song of the tyrant.

##### Song over the anticipated destruction of Moab #####

|   [25:9] That day it will be said:
|   behold! This is our God,
|     for whom we have waited – to save us.
|   This is the LORD  for whom we have waited,
|     O let us rejoice and be glad – he has saved us.
|   [25:10] For here upon this mountain
|     the hand of the LORD  will rest;
|   and Moab will be trampled
|     in the place whereon he stands,
|     as straw in a dung-pit is trampled,
|   [25:11] should he spread forth his hands.

##### Song of gratitude and hope #####

###### Jerusalem secure: the proud city destroyed ######

[Isaiah 26]

|   [26:1] In that day this song will be sung in the land of Judah:
|   a strong city is ours,
|     with bulwarks and walls
|     that he sets for our safety.
|   [26:2] Open the gates,
|     that the righteous may enter
|     who keeps the faith.
|   [26:3] The mind that is steady
|     you keeps in weal,
|     for it trusts in you.
|   [26:4] Trust in the LORD
|      forevermore;
|   for the LORD GOD
|      is rock of ages.
|   [26:5] For down he has cast
|     the dwellers on high,
|     the towering city,
|   abasing it to the ground,
|     and laying it low in the dust.
|   [26:6] The foot will trample it –
|     the feet of the poor,
|     and the steps of the needy.

###### It is well with the righteous, ill with the persistently wicked ######

|   [26:7] The path of the upright is even,
|     you smooth the way of the righteous.
|   [26:8] We have looked for you, O LORD,
|     to come by your pathway of judgment;
|   we have yearned for a sign of your presence,
|     which men may remember for ever.
|   [26:9] I have yearned for you in the night,
|     yea, with passionate spirit have sought you.
|   When your judgments come over the world,
|     those who dwell on the earth learn righteousness.
|   [26:10] No grace will be shown to the wicked,
|     who righteousness will not learn,
|   but even in the land of truth
|     persist in their evil ways,
|   and are altogether blind
|     to the majesty of the LORD .

###### The utter destruction of the enemy ######

|   [26:11] The LORD, your hand is uplifted,
|     but they are blind thereto;
|     may they see it, and be ashamed.
|   Let the fire, reserved for your foes,
|     and your zeal for your people consume them.
|   [26:12] O LORD, establish our welfare;
|     for all that we have achieved
|     has been wrought for us by you.
|   [26:13] O LORD  who are our God,
|     lords other than yourself
|   have held us in their sway,
|   but *your* name alone will we praise.
|   [26:14] The dead will not live again,
|     the shades will not arise;
|   you have visited them with destruction,
|     and blotted their memory clean.

###### A yet more glorious day ######

|   [26:15] you have, O LORD, increased the nation,
|     enlarged all the bounds of the land,
|     and shown yourself most glorious.
|   [26:16] In our straits, O LORD, we sought you;
|     we cried, because we were crushed,
|     your chastisement was upon us.
|   [26:17] As a woman who is with child,
|     when she draws nigh her time,
|     does cry aloud in her pangs;
|   so were we, Lord, because of your presence.
|     [26:18] For we, too, writhed in pangs,
|     but we brought forth nothing but wind.
|   We achieved for the land no deliverance;
|     the denizens of the world
|     fell not (in battle) before us.
|   [26:19] Your dead will arise unto life,
|     they who dwell in the dust will awake,
|     and utter cries of joy;
|   for a dew (from the regions) of light is your dew,
|     and the earth (refreshed thereby)
|     will quicken the shades into life.

##### Song of the vineyard #####

[Isaiah 27]

|   [27:2] In that day it will be said:
|   vineyard delightsome,
|     sing you of it.

|   [27:3] I am its guardian – the LORD  –
|     I water it moment by moment;
|   that no leaf of it will fail,
|     by day and by night I guard it.
|   [27:4] I cherish no anger against it.
|     But had I the briers and thorns,
|   I would trample them down in the fray,
|     I would burn them up altogether.
|   [27:5] Else, then, let them seek my protection,
|     and let them make peace with me;
|     yea, peace let them make with me.

|   [27:6] That day will Jacob take root,
|     Israel will blossom and bud,
|     and with fruit fill the face of the world.

##### The Lord’s mercy to Israel #####

|   [27:7] Has (Israel) been smitten so sorely
|     as those who smote *her* have been smitten?
|   Or has she been slain without remnant,
|     as those who slew *her* have been slain?
|   [27:8] By dismissal and exile alone
|     does (the LORD ) contend with *her*:
|   he has swept her away by his blast
|     that blows fierce in the day of sirocco.
|   [27:9] On this condition therefore
|     will Israel’s guilt be forgiven –
|   when she puts away her sin
|     the issue thereof will be this –
|   that all the stones of her altars
|     she will grind, like chalk, to powder;
|   that sacred poles and sun-pillars
|     she never will raise again.
|   [27:10] For the fortified city is desolate,
|     a homestead forsaken, forlorn,
|   like a pasture: there browses the calf –
|     there he lies, consuming the branches;
|   [27:11] and there, when the dry boughs are broken,
|     come women who use them for fuel.
|   For the people would not reflect;
|   and so from their maker they win no pity,
|     no favour from their creator.

#### Warnings and promises to Jerusalem ####

##### Woe to Samaria #####

[Isaiah 28]

|   [28:1] Woe to the coronet proud of the drunkards of Ephraim!
|     Woe to the fading flower of her glorious beauty,
|     which crowns the heads of the men who are prostate with wine!
|   [28:2] See! The Lord has in readiness one who is mighty and strong –
|     like a storm of hail, or like tempest destructive,
|   like storm of a mighty tempestuous flood –
|     who will bring her with violence down to the ground.
|   [28:3] The coronet proud of the drunkards of Ephraim
|     will be trampled under foot;
|   [28:4] and the fading flower of her glorious beauty,
|     which crowned the head of the fertile valley,
|   will be as the first ripe fig before summer –
|   no sooner seen than swallowed,
|     the moment it is in the hand.

|   [28:5] But that day will the LORD  of Hosts
|     unto those that are left of his people
|     be coronet lovely and diadem fair –
|   [28:6] a spirit of justice to him
|     who presides over justice,
|   of valour to those at the gate
|     that stem the tide of war.

##### The scoffers of Jerusalem threatened #####

###### Isaiah’s solemn warning to the drunken priests and prophets ######

|   [28:7] But here also men reel with wine
|     and stagger under drink;
|   yea, with drink reel prophet and priest,
|     with wine they are utterly dazed.
|   They reel in the hour of vision,
|     they totter in giving of judgment;
|   [28:8] all tables are full of vomit,
|     and filth is everywhere.

|   [28:9] “To whom does he mean to teach knowledge,
|     and impart his revelation?
|   To children weaned from the milk,
|     to babes just drawn from the breast –
|   [28:10] with his law upon law, law upon law,
|     saw upon saw, saw upon saw,
|     here a little and there a little?”

|   [28:11] (Well! Thus I answer your mocking.)
|   Through barbarous lips and a foreign tongue
|     will (the LORD  now) speak to this people.
|   [28:12] For once had his message to you been this:
|   “The true rest in this – let the weary enjoy it:
|     and this is repose.” But you turned a deaf ear.
|   [28:13] So on this wise the LORD  will speak to you now:
|     “Law upon law, law upon law,
|   saw upon saw, saw upon saw,
|     here a little, and there a little” –
|   to the end that you trip on your way and fall backward,
|     shattered and snared and taken.

###### The folly of the Egyptian alliance ######

|   [28:14] Hear therefore the word of the LORD, you scoffers,
|     who rule this folk in Jerusalem.
|   [28:15] Because you have said, “We are leagued with death,
|     and with Sheol we are compact;
|   so the flood, though it passes in whelming torrents,
|     will never reach unto us;
|   for a lie we have made our refuge,
|     we have sheltered ourselves behind falsehood.”
|   [28:16] Therefore thus says the Lord the LORD,
|     behold! I am laying in Zion a stone,
|   a tried and precious foundation stone,
|     and he who believes will not give way.
|   [28:17] And I will make justice the measuring-line,
|     and righteousness the plummet.
|   Then the refuge of lies will swept by hail,
|     and the shelter deluged by water.
|   [28:18] Your league with death will be clean disannulled,
|     and your compact with Sheol will no wise stand.
|   When the flood swept on, it will trample you down;
|     each time that it passes, ’twill bear you away.
|   [28:19] It will pass every morning – by day and by night –
|     and the word, grasped at last, will bring nothing but terror.
|   [28:20] For the bed is too short for a man to stretch out in,
|     the cover too narrow to wrap himself round.
|   [28:21] For the LORD  will rise as he rose on Mount Perazim,
|     blazing with wrath as in Gibeon’s vale,
|   to perform his task – that task so strange,
|     to accomplish his work – that work so.

|   [28:22] Now scoff you no more, lest your bands become tighter;
|     for this have I heard from the LORD  of Hosts –
|     a decree of destruction o’er all the earth.

##### The patience and considerateness of the divine purpose #####

|   [28:23] Listen, and hear you my voice;
|     attend and hear my speech.
|   [28:24] Does the ploughman keep ploughing for ever,
|     keep opening and harrowing his ground?
|   [28:25] Does he not, after levelling its surface,
|     scatter broadcast fennel and cummin,
|   and plant there wheat and barley,
|     and, for its border, spelt?
|   [28:26] The LORD  it is who has trained him aright,
|     and his God it is who has taught him.

|   [28:27] men thresh not fennel with sledges,
|     nor are cart-wheels rolled over cummin;
|   but fennel is threshed with a staff,
|     and cummin with a flail.
|   [28:28] Do we ever crush bread-corn to pieces?
|     No, we do not keep threshing for ever.

##### The character and fate of Jerusalem #####

###### The fate of Jerusalem ######

[Isaiah 29]

|   [29:1] Woe to you, Ariel, Ariel,
|     city where David encamped.
|   Let one or two years pass by,
|     a cycle of festivals more,
|   [29:2] and distress I will bring upon Ariel,
|     moaning and lamentation,
|   and you will be Ariel indeed.
|   [29:3] I will camp, like David, against you,
|   and circle there round with entrenchments,
|     and set up forts against you.
|   [29:4] And low from the ground you will speak,
|     and your words from the dust will rise humbly
|   with voice like a ghost’s from the ground,
|     with twittering speech from the dust.
|   [29:5] But the horde of your foes will become like fine dust,
|     and the horde of the tyrants like flying chaff.
|   Then swiftly and suddenly
|   [29:6] the LORD  of Hosts will visit you
|   with thunder and with earthquake,
|     and with din stupendous,
|   with whirlwind and with tempest,
|     and flame of devouring fire.
|   [29:7] But the horde of all the nations
|     that fight against Ariel,
|   with all their entrenchments and forts
|     and all the hosts that distress her,
|     will be as a dream, as a vision of night.
|   [29:8] Like a man who is hungry, who dreams that he eats
|     and wakes to find his desire unappeased;
|   like a man who is thirsty, who dreams that he drinks,
|     and wakes all faint, with his thirst unquenched:
|   even so will it be with the horde of all nations
|     that fight against Mount Zion.

###### The spiritual torpor and religious formality of the people ######

|   [29:9] Utterly dazed you will be,
|     utterly blind you will be,
|   and drunken, though not with wine,
|     reeling, though not with strong drink.
|   [29:10] For the LORD  has poured upon you
|     a spirit of slumber deep;
|   the prophets, your eyes, he has sealed,
|     the seers, your heads, he has covered,
|   [29:11] so that the sight of all this is to you
|     as the words on a scroll that is sealed.

 If put into the hands of a scholar with the request that he read it, he will reply, “I cannot, it is sealed.” [29:12] If, however, it be put into the hands of a man who is no scholar, with the request that he read it, he will reply, “I cannot, I am no scholar.”

|   [29:13] And the Lord said:
|   because these people praise me with words,
|   honouring me with their lips,
|     while their hearts are far away –
|   their religion only a mockery,
|     formulate learned by rote –
|   [29:14] I will deal with them therefore once more
|     in a fashion so wondrous strange
|   that their wise men’s wisdom will perish,
|     their prudent men’s prudence will vanish.
|   [29:15] Woe to them who conceal
|     from the LORD  their deep designs,
|   doing their deeds in the dark,
|     unseen, unperceived – so they think!

##### Doubters rebuked by a vision of Israel’s welfare in the latter days #####

|   [29:16] O perverse that you are!
|     Is the potter no more than the clay?
|   Can the thing that is made maintain
|     that it has not been made by its maker?
|   Can the thing that is fashioned deny
|     that the potter has understanding?
|   [29:17] Soon Lebanon’s forests will become an orchard,
|     and orchards will be considered useless forest.
|   [29:18] In that day even the deaf
|     will hear words read from a scroll,
|   and out of the gloom and darkness
|     the eyes of the blind will see.
|   [29:19] And then will the humble win
|     a new joy in the LORD,
|   and the poorest will exult
|     in the Holy One of Israel.
|   [29:20] For the tyrant will have vanished,
|     and the scoffer will have ceased;
|   and those who were zealous in sin
|     will all have been rooted out,
|   [29:21] with those who have falsely condemned,
|     and sought to entrap the judge,
|     and quibbled to injure the innocent.
|   [29:22] Thus therefore says the LORD,
|     the God of the household of Jacob,
|     Abraham’s redeemer:
|   no longer will Jacob be ashamed,
|     no longer will faces grow pale with embarrasment.
|   [29:23] For the moment he beholds his children,
|     what my hands have wrought in his midst,
|     they will count my name as holy,
|   The Holy One of Jacob
|     they then will count as holy,
|     and in awe hold the God of Israel.
|   [29:24] Those who had erred in spirit
|     will then win understanding;
|   and those who had grumbled
|     will willingly learn the truth.

##### The Egyptian alliance a ruinous policy #####

###### The embassy to Egypt ######

[Isaiah 30]

|   [30:1] Ha! you refractory sons, says the LORD,
|     who follow a purpose I did not inspire,
|   and who make an alliance that *I* did not sanction,
|     thus heaping sin upon sin.
|   [30:2] They start on their journey to Egypt,
|     without consulting me,
|   to flee to the shelter of Pharaoh will turn to your shame,
|     and the shadow of Egypt will prove your confusion.
|   [30:4] The princes encamp in Zoan,
|     the envoys arrive at Hanes,
|   [30:5] all of them laden with gifts
|     for a people who cannot avail them,
|   that brings no help or profit,
|     but only disgrace and shame.

|   [30:6] Oracle concerning the beasts of the South.
|     Through a land of distress and hardship,
|   of lioness and roaring lion,
|     of viper and flying dragon,
|   they carry their wealth on the backs of young asses,
|     their treasures on humps of camels,
|   to a people who cannot avail them,
|     whose help is vain and empty.
|   [30:7] And therefore I name her Rahab,
|     the monster brought to silence.

###### Judah’s rebellion and ruin ######

|   [30:8] Now go and write it down,
|     and on a roll inscribe it,
|   that it may be for the after-time,
|     a testimony for ever.
|   [30:9] For a rebel people are they,
|     sons who are utterly false,
|   sons who refuse to listen
|     to the teaching of the LORD  –
|   [30:10] That forbid the seers to see
|     and the prophets to prophesy truth.
|   “Speak to us smooth things,” they say,
|     “and prophesy illusions.
|   [30:11] Give over your wonted ways,
|     and leave your well-worn tracks;
|   and trouble us no more
|     with the Holy One of Israel.”

|   [30:12] This therefore is the message
|     of the Holy One of Israel:
|   “Because you reject this word,
|     and trust in guile and craft,
|     and lean your weight thereon,
|   [30:13] this guilt of yours will be
|     like a rift in a lofty wall,
|     that bulges, ready to fall,
|   till suddenly and swiftly
|     down it comes with a crash –
|   [30:14] a crash like that of a pitcher
|     so ruthlessly dashed in pieces,
|   that not a shred can be found
|     among the scattered fragments
|   wherewith to take fire from the heart,
|     or to draw from the cistern water.”

|   [30:15] For thus says the Lord the LORD,
|     the Holy One of Israel,
|   “In calmly resting your safety lies,
|     in quiet trust will be your strength.”
|   [30:16] But this you refused. you said “No;
|   but away we will speed upon horseback.”
|     Yes, speed indeed you will.
|   “On steeds that are swift we will ride.”
|     Yes, and swift will be they who pursue you.
|   [30:17] At the menace of five you will flee,
|     until only a remnant be left,
|   like a pole on the top of a mountain,
|     or a signal upon a hill.

##### The final triumph and prosperity of Jerusalem #####

###### Forgiveness and prosperity ######

|   [30:18] Therefore the LORD  waits
|     to show unto you his favour,
|   and therefore he arises
|     to reveal his pity upon you;
|   for the LORD  is God of justice:
|     happy all who long for him.
|   [30:19] For, O people of Zion who dwell in Jerusalem,
|     tears will be yours no more.
|   He will show you his gracious favour;
|     at the (faintest) sound of your cry,
|     he will answer you, soon as he hears it.
|   [30:20] And though the Lord may give unto you
|     scant measure of bread and scarceness of water,
|   yet your teacher no more will withdraw,
|     but your eyes will behold your teacher.
|   [30:21] When you swerves to right of left,
|     you will hear a voice behind you.
|   “This is the way: walk here.”
|   [30:22] And your images you will defile –
|     whether carved and plated with silver,
|     or molten and covered with gold.
|   Like an unclean thing you will scatter them,
|     saying to them, “Begone.”
|   [30:23] Rain he will give for your seed,
|     wherewith you sow the ground;
|   and the wheat that springs from the ground
|     will rich and abundant be.
|   In that day will your cattle
|     graze over pastures broad.
|   [30:24] The oxen and asses that till the ground
|     will feast upon salted provender,
|     that with shovel and fork has been winnowed.
|   [30:25] On every lofty mountain,
|     on every hill that is high,
|   will be streams of running water,
|     on the day of vast slaughter and falling towers.
|   [30:26] And the moonlight will be as the sunlight,
|     and the sun will be sevenfold brighter than now,
|   in the day that the LORD  upbinds
|     the hurt of his people,
|     and heals the wound that has smitten them.

###### The glorious triumph ######

|   [30:27] Behold, the LORD  comes from afar
|     in thick rising clouds and with anger that blazes,
|   with lips that are filled with rage,
|     and tongue like devouring fire,
|   [30:28] with breadth like a rushing torrent,
|     that reaches up to the neck,
|   to sift till the nations are sifted to nothing,
|     to bridle their jaws and to lead them to ruin.

|   [30:29] Then a song you will sing like the song
|     in the night of a holy festival;
|   and gladness of heart will be yours,
|     as is his, who, to sound of flute,
|   sets forth for the Mount of the LORD,
|     to (worship) the rock of Israel.
|   [30:30] The LORD  will utter his glorious voice,
|     he will bring down his arm in the sight of all,
|   in furious indignation,
|     and flame of devouring fire,
|     in cloud-burst and rain-storm and hailstones.
|   [30:31] At the thunder-voice of the LORD,
|     when he smiles with the rod,
|     will Assyria be stricken with terror.
|   [30:32] And each stroke of the rod of destiny,
|     that the LORD  lays upon him,
|   will fall to the music of timbrel and lute;
|     and with brandished arm he will fight against them.
|   [30:33] For already a pyre is prepared,
|     constructed wide and deep,
|   piled high with blazing wood,
|     and fired by the breath of the LORD,
|     as by a stream of brimstone.

##### The folly of the Egyptian alliance #####

[Isaiah 31]

|   [31:1] Woe to those who journey
|     to the land of Egypt for help,
|   who rely on the throngs of her horses and chariots,
|     and trust in the eminent strength of her horsemen,
|   but never turn their eyes
|     to the Holy One of Israel,
|     and ask not the LORD  for counsel.
|   [31:2] Yet he too is wise, and he brings disaster;
|     his threats he has not recalled.
|   He will rise to contend with the household of miscreants,
|     and with those whom the wicked would summon to help them.
|   [31:3] The people of Egypt are men, not God;
|     and their horses are flesh, not spirit.
|   Let therefore the LORD  but stretch forth his hand,
|     and the helper will stumble, the holpen will fall,
|     and both will perish together.
|   [31:4] For thus has the LORD  declared to me:
|   like as a lion growls,
|     or a young lion over his prey,
|   when against him the shepherds are summoned
|     to come in all their strength –
|   at the shout he is undismayed,
|     at their noise he is nothing daunted –
|   so the LORD  of Hosts will come down
|     to fight against Mount Zion,
|   and against the hill thereof;
|   [31:5] then like fluttering birds (they will flee).
|   Thus will the LORD  of Hosts
|     throw his shield around Jerusalem;
|   he will shield her and deliver her,
|     he will spare her and bring her to safety.

##### The enemy’s downfall #####

|   [31:6] O turn, you men of Israel, to him
|     whom deeply you have offended.
|   [31:7] In that day each will disdain
|     the gold and silver idols
|     his guilty hands have made.
|   [31:8] Assyria will fall by no mortal sword;
|     a sword, but not man’s, will devour him.
|   From the face of that sword he will flee,
|     and his youths will be put to task-work.
|   [31:9] In his fear he will flee past his rocky retreat,
|     and his princes will run from the standard in panic.
|   Thus says the LORD  whose fire is in Zion,
|     whose furnace is in Jerusalem.

##### Rulers and people in the coming days #####

[Isaiah 32]

|   [32:1] Behold there comes a king
|     who will rule in a spirit of justice,
|     and princes who govern with equity –
|   [32:2] each like a shelter from the wind,
|     a refuge from storm of rain,
|   or like streamlets of water in dry parched places,
|     or shade of great rock in a weary land.

|   [32:3] Then the eyes that see will not be sealed,
|     and the ears that hear will not be heedless;
|   [32:4] the mind of the rash will judge with discernment,
|     the stammering tongue will be fluent and plain.
|   [32:5] No more will a fool be called “noble.”
|     No more will a knave be named “princely.”

|   [32:6] For the fool speaks folly for ever,
|     his mind evermore plots mischief;
|   his doings are profane,
|     and error he speaks of the LORD .
|   He leaves the hungry unsated,
|     and drink he withholds from the thirsty.
|   [32:7] The tricks of the evil are vile,
|     and villainies he plans –
|   to ruin the humble with lies,
|     and the poor, though his plea may be just.
|   [32:8] But the plans of the “noble” are noble,
|     by nobleness he will endure.

##### Warning to the women #####

|   [32:9] You women who are at ease,
|     arise and hear my voice;
|   you carelessly confident daughters,
|     attend to what I say.
|   [32:10] In little more than a year
|     you will shudder, for all your confidence;
|   for the vintage will surely fail,
|     and the fruit will not be garnered.
|   [32:11] Tremble, you women at ease,
|     and you who are confident, shudder;
|   strip you, and make you bare,
|     gird (sackcloth) upon your loins,
|   [32:12] and beat upon your breasts
|     in lament for the pleasant fields,
|     and for the fruitful vines,
|   [32:13] and for the land of my people,
|     overgrown with thorns and briers.
|   Not a house of mirth will be left
|     in all the jubilant city.
|   [32:14] The palace will be forsaken,
|     the thronging city deserted;
|   watchtower and hill will become
|     an everlasting waste.

##### The security and prosperity of the coming days #####

|   [32:15] But yet from the heavenly height
|     will a spirit be poured upon us,
|   and the desert become like a garden,
|     and the garden be counted a forest.
|   [32:16] Then justice will dwell in the desert,
|     and righteousness live in the garden-land.
|   [32:17] Of justice the fruit will be peace,
|     and the outcome of righteousness safety
|     and quietness for ever.
|   [32:18] My people will dwell in the mansion of peace,
|     at the easeful rest in abodes secure.
|   [32:19] The forest will be felled,
|     and the city laid utterly low.
|   [32:20] Happy are you who may sow
|     in a land that is all well watered,
|     where oxen and asses may roam.

##### The present distress and the future glory of Jerusalem #####

###### The distress ######

[Isaiah 33]

|   [33:1] Woe to you, spoiler, whom none has despoiled;
|     you treacherous robber, whom no one has robbed.
|   When your spoiling is over, you too will be spoiled;
|     when your robbing is ended, you too will be robbed.

|   [33:2] O LORD, be gracious to us,
|     we have waited for you;
|   be you our arm every morning,
|     our saviour in time of distress.

|   [33:3] At the sound of the tumult the peoples are fled;
|     you lift yourself, and the nations are scattered.
|   [33:4] (Your folk), like the locusts, will gather the booty,
|     over it swarming, as grasshoppers swarm.

|   [33:5] The Lord is exalted, he dwells on high;
|     with justice and righteousness Zion he fills,
|   [33:6] with wealth of salvation and wisdom and knowledge,
|     with treasure that flows the fear of the LORD .

|   [33:7] The heroes of Ariel are crying without,
|     the envoys of peace shed bitter tears;
|   [33:8] forlorn are the highways, the wayfarer ceases.
|   He has broken the compact and mocked at its witnesses,
|     utterly reckless of human kind.
|   [33:9] The earth mourns and languishes,
|     Lebanon withers in shame:
|   Sharon is now like a desert,
|     and Bashan and Carmel are leafless.

###### The deliverance ######

|   [33:10] But thus says the LORD, “Now *I* will arise;
|     yea now, even now, I will lift me on high.
|   [33:11] You are pregnant with chaff, and your child will be stubble,
|     my breath will devour you like fire.

|   [33:12] The nations will sink through the burning ashes,
|     like a thorns cut away, that are kindled with fire.
|   [33:13] The men of far countries will hear of my doings,
|     and those who are near will acknowledge my might.”

|   [33:14] The sinners in Zion are filled with terror,
|     and shuddering seizes the souls profane.
|   “O who can dwell with devouring fire?
|     Who can dwell with eternal flame?”

|   [33:15] Who walks in righteousness, speaks with honesty,
|     scorns the gain that is won by oppression;
|   whose hand refuses to clutch at a bribe,
|     who stops his ears at a tale of blood,
|   who closes his eyes at the sight of evil:
|     [33:16] he it is who will dwell on impregnable heights.
|   On a fastness of rock his stronghold will be,
|     where his bread is provided, his water is sure.
|   [33:17] Your eyes will behold the king in his beauty,
|     they will look on the land that stretches afar.
|   [33:18] And thus you will muse on the (vanished) terror:
|     “Where is he who once weighed, who once counted the tribute,
|     and he who once counted the towers (for assault)?”
|   [33:19] No more you will look on the insolent people,
|   the people of dark and difficult speech,
|     who chatter a barbarous, meaningless tongue.

|   [33:20] Look on the city of Zion,
|     the home of our festal assemblies;
|   your eyes will behold Jerusalem,
|     as a home of ease, a tent unremoved,
|   whose pegs will never be plucked from the ground,
|     and not one of whose cords will be snapped asunder.

|   [33:21] In place of broad encompassing streams
|     will be there for our comfort the LORD ’s own river,
|   a river where sails no fleet with oars,
|     and stately galleys pass not over.

|   [33:22] For the LORD  himself is our judge,
|     the LORD  himself is our marshall,
|   the LORD  himself is our king:
|     it is he, he alone, who will save us.

|   [33:23] Then will the blind divide spoil in abundance,
|     and then will rich plunder be seized by the lame.
|   [33:24] Nevermore will inhabitants say, “I am sick,”
|     for the sins of her people are all forgiven.

#### The Golden Age ####

##### The day of vengeance #####

###### The destruction of the nations ######

[Isaiah 34]

|   [34:1] Draw nigh, you nations, and hearken;
|     you peoples, give attention.
|   Let the earth and its fullness hearken,
|     the world and all its offspring.

|   [34:2] For the LORD  is wroth with all nations,
|     and angry with all their host;
|   he has doomed them to destruction,
|     has given them up to slaughter.

|   [34:3] Their slain will be flung out,
|     and a stench will arise from their corpses;
|   the mountains will run with their blood,

|   [34:4] The heavens will roll up like a scroll,
|     and all their host will fade –
|   as the leaves fade away from the vine,
|     as the foliage fades from the fig tree.

###### The destruction of Edom ######

|   [34:5] For already drunk with his wrath
|     is the sword of the LORD  in heaven.
|   See! Down it descends upon Edom
|     in doom on that people accursed.

|   [34:6] Blood-gorged is the sword of the LORD
|      It is smeared all over with fat
|   with the blood of lambs and of goats,
|     with the fat of the kidneys of rams.

|   For the LORD  has a sacrifice in Bozrah,
|     vast slaughter in Edom’s land:
|   [34:7] with those will be struck down wild oxen,
|     and bullocks together with steers.

|   Their land will be drunken with blood,
|     and their dust will be smeared with fat;
|   [34:8] for the LORD  has set him a day of revenge,
|     and the champion of Zion a year of requital.

|   [34:9] Her streams will be turned into pitch,
|     and the dust of the land into brimstone;
|   her land will be turned into pitch,
|     that burns night and day.

|   [34:10] It will not be quenched for ever,
|     her smoke will go up through the ages;
|   a waste she will lie evermore,
|     to be crossed by no traveller for ever –

|   [34:11] The haunt of the pelican and bittern,
|     the home of the owl and the raven:
|   the LORD  will stretch out upon her
|     the measuring-line of chaos,
|     and the plumbs of destruction.

|   [34:12] No kingdom will there be proclaimed,
|     and her princes will be no more.

|   [34:13] Where her palaces were, will spring thorns;
|     in her fortresses, nettles and thistles.
|   A haunt she will be for jackals,
|     a place for the camping of ostriches.

|   [34:14] wild cats will join the hyenas,
|     and satyrs will meet with their fellows;
|   there only the night-hag reposes,
|     and finds her place of rest.

|   [34:15] There the arrow-snake nestles and lays,
|     there she broods and hatches her eggs;
|   there only the vultures gather –
|     not one without its mate.

|   [34:16] Search in the book of the LORD  –
|     not one of all these is missing;
|   for the LORD ’s own lips have commanded,
|     and his is the breath that has gathered them.

|   [34:17] *He* has assigned it by lot to them,
|     his is the hand that apportioned it,
|   as their everlasting possession,
|     their home through all the ages.

##### The joy of the redeemed #####

[Isaiah 35]

|   [35:1] Let the desert and parched land rejoice,
|     let the steppe-land exult and burst forth;
|   let it burst into bloom like narcissus,
|     and ring with glad cries of rejoicing,

|   [35:2] All dowered with the glory of Lebanon,
|     the splendour of Carmel and Sharon:
|   they will witness the LORD ’s own glory,
|     the majesty of our God.

|   [35:3] Strengthen the hands that hang down,
|     and the tottering knees make firm;
|   [35:4] tell you the wild-beating hearts
|     to be strong and unafraid.
|   Behold! your God is coming,
|     he will surely avenge his people;
|   God is coming in retribution,
|     he himself is coming to save you.

|   [35:5] Then the eyes of the blind will be opened,
|     the ears of the deaf unstopped;
|   [35:6] then the lame will leap like a hart
|     and the tongue of the dumb will sing.

|   For waters break out in the desert,
|     and torrents in the wilderness;
|   [35:7] the parched land becomes a pool,
|     and the thirsty land springs of water.

|   In the haunts of (wild cats and of) jackals
|     (your flocks and your herds) will rest,
|   and the court (where the ostriches camp)
|     will be filled with reeds and rushes.

|   [35:8] And there a pure highway will rise,
|     to be called “The Holy Way”.
|   The unclean will not pass over it,
|     only those who walk in God’s way,
|     even fools will not go astray.

|   [35:9] No lion will be there,
|     no ravenous beast will ascend it;
|   but there will the ransomed walk,
|     yea, the LORD ’s redeemed will come home.

|   [35:10] They will come unto Zion with singing;
|     and crowned with unending joy;
|   for at last joy and gladness have found them,
|     and sorrow and sighing are fled.

#### Historical Appendix ####

##### Isaiah encourages Hezekiah to resist Sennacheirb’s summons to surrender Jerusalem #####

###### First narrative ######

[Isaiah 36]

 [36:1] In the fourteenth year of the reign of Hezekiah, Sennacherib, King of Assyria, after having assaulted and captured all the fortified cities of Judah, [36:2] despatched his Chief Officer from Lachish with a large force against King Hezekiah in Jerusalem. Near the conduit of the upper pool, where he had taken up his position on the Fuller’s Field Road, [36:3] he was visited by a deputation consisting of Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, Governor of the Palace, Shebna the Secretary, and Joah the son of Asaph, the Recorder.

 [36:4] The Chief Officer began: “This is the message from the Great King, the King of Assyria: I desire [36:5] you to deliver it to Hezekiah. ’What sort of confidence is this that you cherish? Do you imagine that in war a mere word of the lips is the equivalent of wisdom and strength? Now who is it you are [36:6] trusting in, that you presume to rebel against me? Of course you are trusting to Egypt, that staff of broken reed, which will enter and piece the hand of the man who leans upon it: that is all that Pharaoh King of Egypt will prove to those who [36:7] trust to him. If, however, you tell me you are trusting to your God the LORD, why, that is the very god whose sanctuaries and altars Hezekiah has abolished, commanding the people of Judah and Jerusalem to confine their worship to the altar at this [36:8] place? Now, make a wager, if you like, with my lord the King of Assyria: I am prepared to furnish you with two thousand horses, if you on your part [36:9] can supply them with riders. (But if you cannot), how do you propose to repel the onset of one of the least of my lord’s officers? Yet you trust to Egypt [36:10] for chariots and horsemen. And now do you imagine that I have not the LORD ’s sanction for invading this land with a view to its destruction? Why, it is the LORD  himself who commissioned me to invade this land and destroy it.’”

 [36:11] Thereupon Eliakim, Shebna, and Joah asked the Chief Officer to be good enough not to speak to them in Hebrew, in the hearing of the people on the wall, but in Aramaic, which they assured him [36:12] they understood. “No,” replied the Officer, “it is not to your lord and yourself that my lord has sent me with this message, but precisely to the men on the wall, whom your policy is likely to reduce to eating their own filth and drinking their own water. ”

 [36:13] Then the Chief Officer came forward and cried aloud in Hebrew, “Listen to the words of the [36:14] Great King, the King of Assyria. Thus says the King: do not let yourselves be imposed upon by [36:15] Hezekiah, for he is powerless to deliver you; and do not let yourselves be induced to trust to the LORD  by Hezekiah’s assurances that the LORD  will unquestionably save you, and that this city will not be delivered into the hands of the King of Assyria. [36:16] Give no heed to Hezekiah; for thus says the King of Assyria to you, Make your peace with me and surrender, and then everyone will eat of his own vine and fig tree, and drink water from his own [36:17] cistern, till I come and take you to a land like your own – a land of corn and wine, a land of bread and [36:18] vineyards. Do not let Hezekiah delude you with assurances that the LORD  will save you. Has the god of any nation ever rescued his land from the grasp [36:19] of the King of Assyria? Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where are the gods Sepharvain? And where are the gods of the land of Samaria? Have they rescued Samaria from [36:20] his grasp? Which of all these national gods has succeeded in rescuing his land from my grasp, that the LORD  should now rescue Jerusalem from my [36:21] grasp?” To this they answered not a word, they remained silent; for the King had expressly told [36:22] them not to answer him. Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, Governor of the Palace, and Shebna the Secretary, and Joah the son of Asaph, the Recorder, tore their garments, and returned to Hezekiah, telling him what the Chief Officer had said.

[Isaiah 37]

 [37:1] When King Hezekiah heard this, he tore his garments, covered himself with sackcloth, and went [37:2] into the Temple; and he despatched Eliakim, Governor of the Palace, and Shebna the Secretary, and the elders of the priests, all covered with sackcloth, [37:3] to the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz, to whom they spoke as follows: “A message from Hezekiah! This is a day of trouble, chastisement, and disgrace: for children are come to the birth, [37:4] and there is not strength to bear them. But it may be that the LORD  your God will hear the words of the Chief Officer, whom the King of Assyria, his master, has sent to insult the living God, and will punish the word which the LORD  your God has heard: so lift up [37:5,6] your prayer for those that remain.” And this was the answer that Isaiah returned to the deputation of King Hezekiah’s ministers: “Tell your master,” he said, “that the LORD ’s message to him is this: he is not to be afraid of the blasphemous words he has heard from the minions of the King of Assyria. [37:7] ’Behold,’ says he, ’I will inspire him with such a spirit (of panic) that on the strength of a rumour he will return to this own land, and there, in his own land, I will cause him to fall a victim to the sword.’”

 [37:8] Then the Chief Officer returned and found the King of Assyria engaged in the siege of Libnah, for he had heard that he had moved his camp from Lachish. [37:9] When the news reached him that Tirhakah King of Ethiopia was advancing to give him battle, he sent messengers to Hezekiah with the following instructions.

###### Second narrative ######

|   [37:10] “This,” said he, “is what you are to say to Hezekiah King of Judah, [37:11] Do not let the god you trust in delude you with his assurance that Jerusalem will not be delivered into the hands of the King of Assyria. you are well aware of the ruin the King of Assyria has brought upon all lands, and are *you* to escape? [37:12] Were the nations which my father destroyed saved by their gods – Gozan and Haran and Rezeph and the [37:13] Edenites in Telassar? Where is the King of Hamath and the King of Arpad and the King of the city of Sepharvaim, of Hena and Ivvah?”

 [37:14] Hezekiah received the letter at the hands of the messengers and read it; then he went up to the [37:15] Temple and spread it before the LORD, and to [37:16] the LORD  thus he prayed: “O LORD  of Hosts, God of Israel, enthroned upon the cherubim, you are God alone over all the kingdoms of the earth: you are the creator of heaven and earth. [37:17] Incline your ear, O LORD, and hear; open your eyes, O LORD, and see; and hear the message of Sennacherib which he has sent to insult [37:18] the living God. True it is, O LORD, that the Kings of Assyria have devoted all nations and [37:19] their lands to destruction, and thrust their gods in the fire, for no gods were they at all, but wood and stone, fashioned by human hands and so they were [37:20] destroyed. But now, O LORD  our God, save us from his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that you alone, O LORD, are God.” [37:21] Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent this answer back to Hezekiah: “Thus says the LORD  the God of Israel: I have heard your prayer concerning Sennacherib, King of Assyria. [37:22] This is the word of the LORD  concerning him:

|   the virgin, the daughter of Zion,
|     contemns you and mocks you;
|   behind you Jerusalem’s daughter
|     is shaking her head.
|   [37:23] Against whom have you lifted your voice
|     in reviling and blasphemy?
|   Yea, your eyes you have lifted to heaven
|     against Israel’s Holy One.
|   [37:24] You have reviled, by your minions,
|     the Lord, and have said,
|   “With my chariots I climb the high hills,
|     the recesses of Lebanon;
|   her towering cedars I fell,
|     and her cypresses choice;
|   and I pierce to her furthest retreat,
|     where the forest is thickest.
|   [37:25] Wells, too, (in the desert) I dig,
|     and I drink of strange waters;
|   with the sole of my foot I dry up
|     all the Nile-streams of Egypt.”
|   [37:26] Have you not heard that all this
|     I prepared long ago?
|   From the old I had planned it, and now
|     I have brought it to pass:
|   so ’tis yours to lay fortified cities
|     in desolate heaps.
|   [37:27] Their inhabitants, impotent all,
|     are dismayed and confounded,
|   become like the grass of the field,
|     like the green tender grass;
|   they are like unto grass on the roofs
|     that the east wind has blasted.
|   [37:28] Your sitting and rising I know,
|     and your going and coming;
|   [37:29] your raging and uproar against me
|     are come to my ears.
|   So my ring I will put through your nose
|     and my bit in your lips,
|   and (thus led) I will make you return
|     by the way that you came.
|   [37:30] And the sign unto you will be this:
|   this year you will eat that which grows of itself,
|     and the next that which springs therefrom;
|   but the third you will sow and reap,
|     plant vineyards and eat of their fruit.
|   [37:31] And those who escape of the household of Judah
|     will again take root downward, and upward bear fruit;
|   [37:32] for out of Jerusalem will go forth a remnant,
|     and forth from Mount Zion all such as escape.
|   The zeal of the LORD  of Hosts
|     will bring this thing to pass.

|   [37:33] Therefore thus says the LORD  concerning the King of Assyria,
|   he will not come into this city,
|     nor shoot an arrow there;
|   he will not come before it with shield,
|     nor cast up a mound against it.
|   [37:34] But back he will go by the way that he came,
|     and into this city he will not enter;
|   [37:35] for I will protect and deliver this city,
|     for my own sake and David my servant’s sake.

 [37:36] Then the angel of the LORD  went forth and slew in the camp of Assyria one hundred and eighty-five thousand men: when they rose in the morning, behold! Every man was a lifeless corpse. [37:37] So Sennacherib, King of Assyria, broke up camp and returned to Nineveh, where he settled.  [37:38] Subsequently, as he was worshipping in the temple of Nisroch his god, he was assassinated by his sons Adrammelech and Sharezer. They, however, made good their escape to Armenia, and he was succeeded by Esar-haddon his son.

##### Hezekiah’s sickness, recovery, and song of thanksgiving #####

###### Hezekiah’s sickness ######

[Isaiah 38]

 [38:1] In those days Hezekiah was seized with a mortal sickness: and the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz came to him and said, “The LORD  commands you to set your household affairs in order; for you will [38:2] not recover, you are to die.” Then, turning his face to the wall, Hezekiah offered this prayer to [38:3] the LORD : “Remember, O LORD, I beseech you, how I have lived in your presence with a faithful and undivided heart, and done the thing that pleased you.” And Hezekiah wept bitterly. Then [38:4] there came to Isaiah this message from the LORD, [38:5] “Go and say to Hezekiah: this says the LORD, the God of David your father, ’I will add to your life fifteen [38:6] years more. you and this city together I will rescue from the grasp of the King of Assyria, and [38:7] “Take this,” he replied, “as a sign from the LORD [38:8]  that he will do what he has promised. Watch the shadow that the descending sun has cast on the step-clock of Ahaz: I will bring that shadow ten steps backward.” and the sun did indeed go back on the step-clock the ten steps it had gone down.

###### Hezekiah’s song of thanksgiving ######

 [38:9] A psalm of Hezekiah King of Judah, to celebrate his recovery from the sickness which had overtaken him:

|   [38:10] me thought I was doomed to depart
|     when my life was at noon-tide –
|   consigned to the portals of Sheol
|     the rest of my years.
|   [38:11] I had thought to see the LORD  nevermore
|     in the land of the living,
|   and never again to behold
|     any man in this world.

|   [38:12] Like the tent of a shepherd, my home
|     is plucked up and stripped from me;
|   he has rolled up my life like a web,
|     from the thrum he has cut me.
|   To pain I am doomed night and day,
|   [38:13] and I cry till the morning,
|   while all my bones, like a lion
|     he crushes in pieces.

|   [38:14] I scream as screams a swift,
|     like a dove do I moan;
|   my eyes look tearfully heavenward:
|     O think on me, Lord, be my surety.
|   [38:15] What can I utter or say,
|     since ’tis he has done it.
|   I toss all the time of my slumber –
|     my soul is so bitter.
|   [38:16] O rest you my spirit, refresh me,
|     and let me recover.
|   [38:17] "Tis you who have kept my soul
|     from the pit of destruction.
|   Behind your back you have cast
|     my iniquities all.

|   [38:18] For Sheol can give you no thanks,
|     nor can Death sing your praises;
|   and they who go down to the pit
|     cannot hope for your love.
|   [38:19] It is the living, the living, who praise you,
|     as I do this day.
|   So the father will tell to his sons
|     of your faithfulness sure.

|   [38:20] Be pleased, O LORD, to save us:
|     then all the days of our life
|   we will play upon instruments stringed
|     in front of the house of the LORD . [38:21] this city I will protect.’” 

 Then Isaiah said, “Let them take a cake of figs and press it on the boil, to [38:22] ensure his recovery.” And Hezekiah said, “What is the sign that I will yet go up to the Temple?”

##### Hezekiah’s vanity and Isaiah’s rebuke #####

[Isaiah 39]

 [39:1] At that time, merodach-baladan the son of Baladan, King of Babylon, having heard that Hezekiah had been ill and had recovered, despatched [39:2] eunuchs to him with a present. Hezekiah, delighted, proceeded to display to them his treasure-house, the silver, the gold, the spices, the fine oil, the armoury, and the whole range of his treasures: there was nothing in his place or indeed in all his dominion that Hezekiah did not show them.

 [39:3] Then came the prophet Isaiah to King Hezekiah and said, “Where do these men come from, and what have they said?” “They have come,” said Hezekiah, “from a distant land, from Babylon.” [39:4] “What have they seen in your palace?” said Isaiah; and Hezekiah answered, “Everything: there is none of my treasures that I have not shown them.” [39:5] “Listen, then,” said Isaiah, “to the word of the LORD [39:6]  of Hosts. Mark, the day is coming, when all that is in your palace, and all the treasures that you ancestors have hither to amassed, will be carried to [39:7] Babylon: nothing will be left, says the LORD . And of the sons who may yet be born to you, some will be taken to become eunuchs is the palace of the [39:8] King of Babylon.” Then said Hezekiah to Isaiah, “I accept the word of the LORD  which you have spoken.” At least, thought he, there will be peace and stability in my day.

### The Exiles’ Book of Consolation ###

#### The Lord is the Lord of Nature and History ####

##### The glorious news – redemption is nigh #####

[Isaiah 40]

|   [40:1] “Comfort you, comfort my people,”
|     declares your God.
|   [40:2] “Speak home to the heart of Jerusalem,
|     cry unto her
|   that her time of sore service is over,
|     her guilt is discharged;
|   for her sins she has doubly atoned
|     at the hand of the LORD .”

|   [40:3] Hark! Says a voice, “In the wilderness
|     clear you a way for the LORD ;
|   make you straight in the desert
|     a highway for our God.
|   [40:4] Let every valley be raised,
|     every mountain and hill brought low;
|   let the steep rugged ground become level,
|     the rough rocky ridges a plain.
|   [40:5] Then the LORD  will show forth his glory,
|     and all fresh will see it together:
|     the mouth of the LORD  has spoken it.”

|   [40:6] Hark! Says a voice, “Proclaim.”
|     “What should I proclaim?” said I.
|   “Proclaim that all flesh is grass,
|     all its grace as the flower of the field.
|   [40:7] The grass withers, the flower fades,
|     when upon it the breath of the LORD  has blown.
|   [40:8] Yea, the grass withers, the flower fades;
|     but the word of our God will stand for ever.”

|   [40:9] Get you up to a mountain high,
|     you who tell good tidings to Zion;
|   lift up your voice with strength,
|     you who bring good news to Jerusalem;
|     lift it up, be not afraid.
|   Say to the cities of Judah,
|     “Yonder comes your God.”

|   [40:10] See! The LORD  is coming in might,
|     with an arm that ensures his dominion.
|   Behold, his reward is with him,
|     his recompense is before him.
|   [40:11] He feeds his flock like a shepherd,
|     he gathered it with his arm;
|   he carries the lambs in his bosom,
|     and those who give suck he leads.

##### The sovereignty and omnipotence of God as seen in nature #####

|   [40:12] Who has measured the waters in the hollow of his hand?
|     Who has ruled off the heavens with a span,
|   comprehend the dust of the earth in a measure,
|   and weighed the mountains in scales,
|     and the hills in a balance?

|   [40:13] Who has directed the mind of the LORD ?
|     And where is the counsellor who taught him?
|   [40:14] Whom did he ask for enlightenment?
|   Who taught him the pathway of right,
|     or showed him the way of true insight?

|   [40:15] See! Nations are nothing but a drop on a bucket,
|     they count but as dust on a balance;
|   he lifted the isles like a mote.
|   [40:16] Too small for the fires (of his altars) is Lebanon,
|     too few are its breasts for an offering.

|   [40:17] All nations are nothing before him,
|     he counts them but empty nothing.
|   [40:18] So to whom will you liken God,
|     or what likeness set over against him?
|   [40:19] An imagine! A craftsman has cast it,

[Isaiah 41]

|     A goldsmith o’erlaid it with gold.
|   [41:6] Each workman helps his fellow,
|     and says to his neighbour, “Set to.”
|   [41:7] So the craftsman heartens the goldsmith,
|     the polisher says to the finisher,
|   “Fine piece of soldering that!”

[Isaiah 40]

|     Then the nails down the statue securely.
|   [40:20] And he would carve a wood image
|     makes choice of a wood that decays not;
|   then he seeks a craftsman of skill,
|     to erect for him an image,
|     that is warranted not to topple.

|   [40:21] But know you not then of yourselves, or from hearsay?
|     Has this from the first not been told you?
|   Of this have you not been aware,
|     since the day that the world was founded?
|   [40:22] It is he who sits throned on the vault of the earth,
|     so high that the dwellers thereon are like locusts;
|   who stretches the heavens across like a veil,
|     and spreads them out like a tent to dwell in.
|   [40:23] It is he who reduces proud princes to nothing,
|     who turns the rulers of earth into nothing.
|   [40:24] Scarce are they planted, and scarce are they sown,
|     and scarce has their stock then root in the earth,
|   when he blows upon them, and so they wither:
|     the whirlwind bears them away like chaff.

|   [40:25] To whom will you liken me, then?
|     And who is my match? says the Holy One.
|   [40:26] Lift up your eyes on high;
|     see! Who has created all those?
|   He who brings their host out by number,
|     and summons each by his name:
|   so great his resource and so mighty his power
|     that not one of them fails to answer.

|   [40:27] Why say you, then, O Jacob,
|     and Israel, why maintain
|   that your lot is unknown to the LORD,
|     your right ignored by your God?
|   [40:28] Know you not of yourself or by hearsay –
|   the LORD  is God eternal,
|     creator of all the earth?

|   He faints not, neither is weary,
|     unsearchable is his wisdom;
|   [40:29] *he * gives power to the weary,
|     and increase of strength to the feeble.
|   [40:30] Youths may faint and grow weary,
|     and young men may stumble and fall;
|   [40:31] but those who wait for the LORD
|      will find their strength renewed;
|     they will put forth pinions like eagles.
|   They will run, and not grow weary;
|     they will walk, and not be faint.

##### The sovereignty of God as seen in history, and especially in the rise of Cyrus #####

###### The rise of Cyrus a proof of the Lord’s power ######

[Isaiah 41]

|   [41:1] Hearken in silence, you coast-lands, to me,
|     and await, you nations, my argument:
|   come hither, then state your case;
|     so let us approach the tribunal together.

|   [41:2] Who raised up him from the east land,
|     whose steps are attended by victory,
|   sweeping the nations before him,
|     and laying king low at his feet?

|   his sword makes them like dust
|     and his bow like the driven stubble;
|   [41:3] he pursues and passes unharmed,
|     nor touches the ground with his feet.

|   [41:4] Who has wrought and accomplished this?
|     He who from the beginning
|     did summon the generations –
|    I, the LORD, was with the first,
|     and with last am I.
|   [41:5] The coast-lands have seen it and feared,
|     the ends of the earth fell a-trembling,
|     they came and drew nigh (to the judgment).

###### Israel is the Lord’s servant, loved and upheld by him ######

|   [41:8] But you, Israel my servant,
|     Jacob, whom I have chosen,
|     the offspring of Abraham my friend;
|   [41:9] whom I fetched from the ends of the earth,
|     and called from the corners thereof,
|   with the words, “My servant are you;
|     I have chosen, and not since rejected you.”
|   My victorious hand will uphold you.

|   [41:11] See! All who are furious against you
|     will end in shame and confusion;
|   the men that contended against you
|     will pass into nothing and perish.
|   [41:12] The men who have striven against you
|     you never will find, though you seek them;
|   the men who are warring against you
|     will wholly and utterly vanish.
|   The LORD  says, I am your helper;
|     your redeemer is Israel’s Holy One.

|   [41:15] A threshing-sledge, see! I will make of you,
|     new and well-furnished with teeth;
|   you will thresh the mountains to powder,
|     the hills you will make like chaff.
|   [41:16] The wind, when you winnow, will scatter them,
|     the whirlwind will bear them away;
|   but you will rejoice in the LORD,
|     and glory in Israel’s Holy One.

|   [41:17] The poor who seek water where water is none,
|     the needy whose tongue is parched with thirst –
|   I, the LORD, will hear their prayer,
|     I, who am Israel’s God, will not leave them.
|   [41:18] But streams on the hills I will open,
|     and springs in the midst of the valleys;
|   the will I turn into pools of water,
|     the land that is parched into fountains of water.

|   [41:19] I will plant in the desert the cedar,
|     acacia, myrtle, and olive;
|   I will set in the wilderness fir-trees,
|     the plane and the cypress together.

###### No heathen god can predict the future ######

|   [41:21] Now then, says the LORD, bring forward your suit,
|     produce your idols, says Jacob’s king.
|   [41:22] Let them come and declare unto us
|     the things that are yet to happen;
|   declare how the past was foretold,
|     that we may give thought thereto.
|   Or announce what is yet to come,
|     that we may mark the issue;
|   [41:23] declare what will be hereafter,
|     and then we will know you are gods.
|   Yea, do aught that you please, good or ill,
|     that may strike us with awe to behold.

|   [41:24] Now see, you are nothing, and you can do nothing:
|     hateful is he who chooses you.

###### No heathen god, but the Lord alone, predicted the advent of Cyrus ######

|   [41:25] I have roused up one from the north, he is come –
|     one from the sunrise who calls on my name;
|   he will trample on princes like mortar,
|     as potter tramples the clay.

|   [41:26] But who from the first has announced this,
|     that so we might recognize it?
|   Or who has aforetime declared it,
|     that now we must own to its truth?
|   There was none who announced or declared it,
|     not one heard a word from *you*.

|   [41:27] It was I who first told it to Zion,
|     and gave the glad news to Jerusalem.

|   [41:28] I looked all around – there was no one;
|     not one of the gods could give counsel
|     or answer, to taught that I asked them.

|   [41:29] See! One and all they are nothing,
|     and nothing can they do:
|     their idols are wind and waste.

#### The servant (Israel), his Task and Destiny ####

##### The servant’s task #####

[Isaiah 42]

|   [42:1] Behold!
|   My servant, whom I uphold;
|     my chosen, the joy of my soul.
|   I have put my spirit upon him;
|     he will publish (my) Law to the nations.

|   [42:2] He will not cry, nor shout,
|     nor utter his voice in the streets;
|   [42:3] not a reed that is bent will he break,
|     nor a wick that burns dim will he quench.

|   He will faithfully set forth (my) Law,
|   [42:4] all erect and aglow he will be:
|   he will yet set (my) Law in the earth,
|     and the islands will wait for his teaching.

|   [42:5] Thus says the LORD, the God
|     who spread out and stretched forth the heavens;
|   who created the earth and its fruits,
|     giving breath to the people upon it,
|     and spirit to them who tread it:
|   [42:6] with full and deliberate purpose
|     have I the LORD  called you,
|     and taken your hand in mine;
|   I formed you as pledge and symbol
|     of my covenant with mankind –
|   a light to enlighten the nations,
|     [42:7] to open the eyes of the blind,
|   and to bring from the dungeon the captives
|     who sit in the darkness of prison.

|   [42:8] I am the (true) God, the LORD ;
|     this is the name that is mine:
|   and my glory I yield to no other,
|     my praise will no image enjoy.
|   [42:9] Behold, the predictions of old are fulfilled,
|     and new things I now declare;
|   before they spring into being,
|     I make them know unto you.

##### The new song #####

|   [42:10] Sing a new song to the LORD,
|     his praise form the end of the earth;
|   let the sea and its fullness roar,
|     the islands and those who dwell there.
|   [42:11] Let the desert rejoice with her cities,
|     the villages Kedar inhabits;
|   let Sela’s inhabitants sing,
|     let them shout from the top of the mountains.
|   [42:12] Let them give to the LORD  glory,
|     and tell forth his praise in the islands.
|   [42:13] The LORD  goes forth like a hero,
|     he stirs his rage like a warrior;
|   he shouts his fierce battle-cry,
|     he engages his foes like a hero.

##### The Lord at last bestirs himself #####

|   [42:14] Long time have I held my peace,
|     and restrained myself in silence;
|   but now, like a woman in travail,
|     I groan, I pant and gasp.
|   [42:15] Mountains and hills I will waste,
|     I will dry up all their herbage;
|   the streams I will turn into sand,
|     and the pools I will clean dry up.
|   [42:16] The blind I will lead and guide,
|     by ways and by paths unfamiliar;
|   their gloom I will turn into light,
|     and the ground that is rough I will level
|   these are the things I will do,
|     they will not be left undone.
|   [42:17] But those who put trust in an idol,
|     and call an image their god,
|     will backward be driven in shame.

##### A call for repentance on Israel’s part #####

|   [42:18] Hearken, you who are deaf;
|     and you blind, look up, that you see;
|   [42:19] who is blind but my servant,
|     and who is deaf as my messenger?
|   Who is blind as my envoy,
|     and the deaf as the LORD ’s servant?
|   [42:20] Much have you seen that you marked not;
|     your ears, though open, were dead.
|   [42:21] The LORD  was pleased, for his righteousness’ sake,
|     to make his instruction great and glorious.
|   [42:22] Yet it is still a people
|     plundered and despoiled,
|   all of them snared in dungeons,
|     and hidden away in prisons –
|   a prey without prospect of rescue,
|     a spoil of which none says “Restore.”
|   [42:23] Which of you now will listen to this,
|     will attend and hear for the time to come?
|   [42:24] Who gave up Jacob to plunderers,
|     and Israel to them who despoiled him,
|   [42:25] and poured his hot anger upon him,
|     in fury of war so intense
|   that it blazed round about him – he knew not why –
|     and it burned him, yet never heart did he lay it?

##### The Lord will show his love for Israel by gathering her exiles home #####

[Isaiah 43]

|   [43:1] But now – thus says the LORD,
|     your creator, O Jacob, your maker, O Israel –
|   fear not, for I have redeemed you,
|     and called you by name: you are mine.
|   [43:2] When you pass through waters, then I will be with you;
|     no rivers will bear you away in their flood:
|   when you walk through fire, you will no wise be scorched,
|     and the flames will not kindle upon you.

|   [43:3] For I am the LORD  your God,
|     your deliverer, Israel’s Holy One;
|   Egypt I give as your ransom,
|     yea, Seba and Cush in your stead,
|   [43:4] because in my sight you are precious,
|     both honoured and beloved,
|   those lands I will give as your ransom,
|     those peoples in your stead.
|   [43:5] Therefore fear not, for I am with you.

|   I will bring your seed from the sunrise,
|     and gather you out of the sunset;
|   [43:6] I will say to the north, “Give them up;”
|     and unto the south, “Withhold them not.”
|   Bring in my sons from afar,
|     and my daughters from the ends of the earth –
|   [43:7] every one who is called by my name,
|     whom I fashioned and made for my glory.

##### Israel is the Lord’s witness to the world #####

|   [43:8] Forth! you folk who have eyes, but are blind;
|     and you who have ears, yet are deaf.
|   [43:9] The nations are all assembled,
|     the peoples are gathered together.
|   Which of them all can declare such a thing,
|     or announce to us such in advance?
|   Let them prove themselves right by the witness they bring,
|     who will say, when they hear, “It is true.”

|   [43:10] But *you* are my witnesses – thus says the LORD  –
|     my servants, whom I have chosen,
|   that they may acknowledge and trust me,
|     and learn I am ever the same.
|   No god was formed before me,
|     and after me will be none.
|   [43:11] I am the LORD,
|     and saviour beside me is none.

|   [43:12] It was I, and no strange god among you,
|     who announced and declared and delivered.
|   You are my witnesses – thus says the LORD  –
|     and I am God from of old,
|   [43:13] from henceforth ever the same.
|   There is none who can snatch from my hand,
|     and who can reverse what I do?

##### The deliverance from Babylon more wonderful than the deliverance from Egypt #####

|   [43:14] Thus says the LORD, your redeemer,
|     the Holy One of Israel:
|   for your sake I send unto Babylon,
|     and down will I bring them in flight.
|   I will lay the Chaldeans low,
|     and turn their rejoicing to mourning;
|   [43:15] for I am the LORD, your Holy One,
|     the creator of Israel, your king.

|   [43:16] Thus says the LORD,
|   who of old made a way through the Sea,
|     and a path through the mighty waters;
|   [43:17] who chariot and horse led forth,
|     the warriors and war-host together –
|   they lay down, but they rose no more,
|     they were quenched and put out like a wick –
|   [43:18] think of those old things no more,
|     nor give heed to those deeds of the old time.
|   [43:19] For see! I am doing a new thing,
|   already it springs to view:
|     do you not recognize it?

|   Yea, a path I will make through the desert,
|     and rivers in the wilderness;
|   [43:20] the wild beasts will render me honour,
|     the jackals and the ostriches.
|   For with water I shower the desert,
|     the wilderness with streams,
|   to yield drink to my chosen people,
|   [43:21] the people I formed for myself,
|   to tell abroad my praise.

##### Israel’s restoration is due, not to her own merits, but to the Lord’s free grace #####

|   [43:22] Yet you have not called upon me, O Jacob,
|     nor wearied yourself about me, O Israel.
|   [43:23] You have not brought unto me
|     burnt offerings of sheep,
|     nor did honour me with your sacrifice.

|   I burdened you not with offerings,
|     nor wearied you with frankincense;
|   [43:24] you brought me no sweet cane with your money,
|     you sated me not with the fat of your sacrifice.
|   But you by your sins have burdened me,
|     and through your transgressions have wearied me.
|   [43:25] Yet I am he 
|     who blots out your transgressions;
|     your sins I remember no more.
|   [43:26] Call to my mind your merits,
|     let us urge our several pleas;
|   reckon up all that you can,
|     to prove yourself in the right.
|   [43:27] Your ancient sire was a sinner,
|     your prophets were rebels against me,
|   [43:28] my Temple your princess profaned;
|   so Jacob I gave to destruction,
|     and Israel to reviling.

[Isaiah 44]

|   [44:1] Yet hear now, Jacob my servant,
|     and Israel, whom I have chosen;
|   [44:2] thus says the LORD  your maker,
|     who formed you and helped you from birth:
|   fear not, Jacob my servant;
|     Jeshurun, whom I have chosen:
|   [44:3] for water I will pour on the thirsty,
|     and rills on the ground that is dry,

|   On your sons I will pour out my spirit,
|     my blessing upon their offspring:
|   [44:4] and then they will grow like the grass among waters,
|     like willows by water-courses.
|   [44:5] And one will declare, “I belong to the LORD ;”
|     Another will call himself Jacob:
|   another will write on his hand, “To the LORD,”
|     and add to his own name the surname of Israel.

##### Israel’s God is sovereign and eternal #####

|   [44:6] Thus says the LORD, the King of Israel,
|     his redeemer, the LORD  of Hosts:
|   I am the first, I too am the last,
|     beside me is no god at all.
|   [44:7] Who is like me? Let him stand and proclaim
|     and declare it and set it in order before me?
|   Who has announced from of old things to come?
|     Let them tell us the things that will yet come to pass.
|   [44:8] Be not disquieted, be not afraid:
|     have not I from the old time proclaimed and declared it?
|   you are my witnesses: is there a God
|     or a rock beside me at all?

##### The folly of idolatry #####

|   [44:9] Makers of idols are all an illusion,
|     and profitless all are the idols they dote on;
|   no vision or insight have whose adore them,
|     and so in the end they will come but to shame.
|   [44:10] (The fool who believes) he has fashioned a god,
|     has but fashioned a profitless metal image.
|   [44:11] The magical arts are all put to shame,
|     the words of enchantment are only human.
|   The worshippers all, when they stand assembled,
|     will tremble and come to confusion together.

|   [44:12] The smiths prepare it over the coals,
|     and into the shape that is fitting he hammers it,
|     working it up with his sturdy arm.
|   Then hunger comes over him – feeble he grows,
|     or faint, if so be that he drinks no water.
|   [44:13] The carpenter stretches his measuring-line,
|     with a stylus he traces the shape of the image,
|   and carves it with tools human likeness,
|     a fair human likeness, to rest in a chapel.

|   [44:14] Forth a man goes to cut himself timber;
|     from the forest he chooses a plane or an oak,
|   which the Lord did plant, and the rain has nourished
|     for men to make use of as fuel for kindling.
|   [44:15] He sets it ablaze and he warms himself,
|     or he kindles a fire, and bakes bread;
|   or he makes it into a god and bows down to it,
|     fashions an image and falls down before it.
|   [44:16] One half of the wood in the fire he burns,
|     then he roasts flesh on the embers therefrom;
|   whereafter he eats the roast to his fill,
|     then he warms himself, and he says, “Ha! Ha!
|     Now I am warm, I feel the glow.”
|   [44:17] The rest of it then he makes into a god –
|     to an image, and bows down prostate before it.
|   He prays to it, and his prayer is this:
|     “Deliver you me, for you are my god.”

|   [44:18] No insight has he, and no power of discernment,
|     his eyes are besmeared, that he cannot see,
|     and his mind is sealed past understanding.
|   [44:19] He suffers never his thoughts to ponder,
|     he has not the sense or the insight to say,
|   “One half thereof in the fire I have burned,
|     and bread I have baked on the embers therefrom;
|   flesh I have roasted and eaten: and then
|     of the rest should I make a detestable image,
|     and bow myself down to a block of wood?”

|   [44:20] Who takes delight in combustible idols
|     is led far astray by delusion of heart:
|   he cannot deliver himself, and confess
|     that his hand has been grasping an utter delusion.

##### Let the world rejoice over Israel’s redemption #####

|   [44:21] Remember these things, O Jacob;
|     yea, Israel, for you are my servant.
|   I made you, my servant are you;
|     O Israel, you must not renounce me.
|   [44:22] I blot out your sins as a mist,
|     as a thick dark cloud your transgressions;
|     return unto me, for I have redeemed you.
|   [44:23] Rejoice, O you heavens, for the LORD  has acted.
|     Shout, O you depths of the earth.
|   Break forth into jubilant cries, you mountains,
|     you forest, you trees.
|   For the LORD  has now wrought redemption for Jacob,
|     he shows his glory in Israel.

#### Cyrus and the Overthrow of Babylon ####

##### The Lord calls Cyrus and bestows upon him a career of victory, for Israel and the world’s sake #####

|   [44:24] Thus says the LORD, your redeemer,
|     who formed you from the womb:
|   I am the LORD, creator of all things,
|     who stretched forth the heavens alone,
|     and spread out the earth by myself;
|   [44:25] who frustrates the omens of soothsayers,
|     making diviners like fools,
|   thrusting the wise to the background,
|     and turning their science to folly;

|   [44:26] but the words that *my* servants have spoken I confirm,
|     and the purpose my messengers urge I fulfil.
|   For I say to Jerusalem, “You will be peopled,
|     the cities of Judah will yet be rebuilt,
|     and the ruins thereof I will raise again.”
|   [44:27] I will say to the deep, “Be dry;
|     for all your floods I will wither.”
|   [44:28] Cyrus I name as my friend,
|     he will execute all my purpose,
|     Jerusalem will yet be rebuilt,
|     the Temple foundations will yet be laid.

[Isaiah 45]

|   [45:1] Thus says the (true) God, the LORD,
|     to Cyrus his anointed,
|   whose hand I hold in mine,
|     to bring down nations before him,
|   to open doors before him,
|     and gates – to be closed no more:
|   [45:2] “I will go in person before you,
|     and mountains I will level;
|   I will shiver the doors of bronze,
|     and cleave bars of iron in sunder.

|   [45:3] I will give you the dark-hidden treasures,
|     in secret places hoarded,
|   that so you may learn that I am the LORD,
|     the God of Israel, who called you by name.
|   [45:4] For the sake of Jacob my servant,
|     and Israel my chosen,
|   I called you by your name:
|     though you knew me not, I rejoiced in you.
|   [45:5] I am the LORD, and there is no other;
|     beside me is no god at all.
|   I will gird you, though you knew me not,
|   [45:6] that men from the sunrise and sunset
|     may know there is none beside me.
|   I am the LORD, and there us no other,
|     [45:7] the maker of light, the creator of darkness,
|   the maker of weal, the creator of woe:
|     it is I, the LORD, who does all this.”
|   [45:8] You heavens, pour down your showers,
|     let victory rain from the skies.
|   Let the earth open up
|     and bring forth the fruit of deliverance.
|   Let victory blossom,
|     I, the LORD  have created it.

##### Murmurs against Cyrus rebuked #####

|   [45:9] Woe unto him who strives with his maker –
|     a potsherd no better than earthen potsherd.
|   Does the clay say to the potter,
|     “What thing is this that you make?”
|   Does the vessel he wrought exclaim,
|     “What a heartless person you are!”
|   [45:10] Woe to the son who says,
|     “Sirem what is this you beget?”
|   Or “Mother, what bring you forth?”

|   [45:11] Thus says the (true) God, the LORD,
|     Israel’s maker and Holy One:
|   would you ask me of things to come,
|     or command me as touching my handiwork?
|   [45:12] It was I – the maker of earth,
|     the creator of man upon it,
|   whose hands stretched out the heavens,
|     and on all their host laid charge –
|   [45:13] it was I who of purpose aroused him,
|     and all his ways I smooth:
|   he it is who will build my city,
|     and set my exiles free;
|   yet neither for price nor reward.
|     Thus says the LORD  of Hosts.

##### The heathen acknowledge the uniqueness of Israel and her God #####

|   [45:14] Thus says the LORD  of Hosts:
|   the peasants of Egypt, the merchants of Cush,
|     and the giant men of Seba,
|   will pass in procession as lieges before you,
|     and walk behind you in chains.
|   They will bow to you prostrate, and thus they
|     will pray to you:
|   “God is with you alone,
|     there is no other god at all:
|   [45:15] yea, truly with you God hides himself;
|     yea, Israel’s God is a saviour.”

|   [45:16] Ashamed and confounded together
|     are all who have risen up against him –
|     the idol-making craftsmen.
|   [45:17] But Israel is saved by the LORD
|      with salvation everlasting:
|   you will not be ashamed or confounded
|     for ever and evermore.

##### The Lord desires the salvation of the whole world #####

|   [45:18] For thus says the LORD, God indeed,
|     creator of the heavens,
|   who made the earth and fashioned it,
|     and also fixed it fast,
|   creating it not for a desert,
|     but fashioning it for man’s home:
|   “I am the LORD, and there is none other.

|   [45:19] Not in secret spake I,
|     nor in any land of darkness;
|   the offspring of Jacob I asked not
|     to go in vain quest of me.
|   I am the LORD, my words are true,
|     and straight are my proclamations.

|   [45:20] Come, you who survive of the nations,
|     assemble, draw near together.
|   No shred of sense have they
|     who carry an image of wood,
|   and make their prayers to a god
|     who is impotent to save.

|   [45:21] Declare and bring forward (your case),
|     yea, let them take counsel together:
|   who has announced this old,
|     or declared it in days gone by?
|   Is it not I, the LORD ?
|     There is no other god beside me –
|   a righteous God, and a saviour,
|     and none there is beside me.

|   [45:22] Look unto me and saved,
|     all you ends of the earth;
|   for I am God, and there is no other.
|   [45:23] By my own self have I sworn
|   that to me every knee will bow,
|     every tongue will swear allegiance,
|   [45:24] and own that the LORD  alone
|     is the giver of strength and of victory.”
|   All who were furious against him
|     will come unto him with shame;
|   [45:25] but all the descendants of Israel
|     will triumph and boast in the LORD .

##### The downfall of Babylon’s gods #####

[Isaiah 46]

|   [46:1] Bel bows down, Nebo stoops:
|     consigned are their idols to beasts –
|     on weary beasts lifted and laden.
|   [46:2] They crouch, they are bowed down together;
|     unable to rescue their load,
|     they themselves are gone into captivity.

|   [46:3] Hearken to me, house of Jacob,
|     you of Israel’s house who remain,
|   all you who from birth have been carried
|     and upheld since the day you were born.
|   [46:4] Till old age I am ever the same;
|     till your hair is grey, I will carry you.
|   It is I who have borne the burden,
|     it is I who will carry it still;
|     it is I who will carry and save you.
|   [46:5] To whom will you liken or equal me?
|     Whom will you set as my peer?

|   [46:6] They who freely give gold from a purse
|     and who weigh in a balance the silver,
|   hire a goldsmith to fashion a god of it;
|     then they fall down and worship it.
|   [46:7] They carry the load on their shoulder,
|     and set it down on its base,
|     where it stands, in its place, unmoved.
|   It answers no man’s cry,
|     it saves no man in his trouble.
|   [46:8] Reflect, then, and own yourselves guilty;
|     you rebels, lay it to heart.
|   [46:9] Remember the things of long ago;
|     for I am God, and there is none like me.
|   [46:10] From the first I declare the issue,
|     from ancient times things yet to be done;
|   I declare that my purpose will stand,
|     I will execute all my pleasure.
|   [46:11] I have called a wild bird from the sunrise,
|     the man of my purpose from a far distant land.
|   I will usher in what I promised,
|     and accomplish the thing that I planned.

|   [46:12] Hearken to me, you faint-hearted,
|     who deem that your triumph is far away;
|   [46:13] the triumph I bring you is near, not far,
|     my deliverance will not tarry.
|   I will set the deliverance in Zion,
|     and lavish my glory on Israel.

##### The downfall of Babylon #####

[Isaiah 47]

|   [47:1] Come down, and sit in the dust,
|     O virgin daughter of Babylon;
|   sit on the ground unthroned,
|     O daughter of the Chaldeans:
|   for you will be called no more
|     the tender and the dainty.
|   [47:2] Take mill-stones, and grind the meal;
|     and put your veil aside.
|   Strip off your skirt, and pass
|     bare-legged through the rivers.
|   [47:3] Let your nakedness be uncovered,
|     and let your shame be seen.
|   For vengeance I will take,
|     irrevocable vengeance –
|   [47:4] thus says our redeemer,
|     the LORD  of Hosts is his name,
|     the Holy One of Israel.

|   [47:5] Sit in silence and shrouded in darkness,
|     O daughter of the Chaldeans;
|   for you will be called no more
|     the mistress of dominions.
|   [47:6] True, I was wroth with my people,
|     my heritage I profaned;
|   and I gave them into your hand,
|     but you showed no pity upon them;
|   you laid upon the aged
|     your exceeding heavy yoke.
|   [47:7] You said, “I will live for ever,
|     and be mistress evermore;”
|   These things you did lay not heart,
|     nor did think how it all would end.

|   [47:8] Hear this now, lady of pleasure,
|     who sits so securely,
|   and says in your heart,
|     “It is I, there is none beside me;
|   I will never sit as a widow,
|     nor know the loss of children.”
|   [47:9] These two things will come upon you,
|     full swift in a single day –
|   the loss of your husband and children
|     will suddenly come upon you,
|   despite your many spells,
|     despite your enchantments many,
|   [47:10] despite your trust in your wickedness,
|     and your fancy that no one can see you.

|   Behold your wisdom and knowledge –
|     ’Tis they who have led you astray;
|   and you in your heart did say,
|   “It is I, there is none beside me.”
|   [47:11] So disaster will come upon you,
|     which no knowledge of your can avert;
|   destruction will fall upon you,
|     which you have no power to appease;
|   sudden ruin will come upon you,
|     which you have no knowledge (to banish).
|   [47:12] Abide, then, by your enchantments,
|     abide by your sorceries many,
|     wherein you have toiled from your youth.
|   Perchance you may somewhat avail,
|     perchance you may yet strike terror.

|   [47:13] You have wearied yourself with your counsellors;
|     now let them stand up and save you –
|   those men who divide up the heavens,
|     directing their gaze to the stars,
|   and month by month make known
|     what things are coming upon you.
|   [47:14] But see! They are all like stubble,
|     the fire burns them up.
|   Not even themselves can they save
|     from the mighty power of the flame: –
|   it is no glowing coal to warm at,
|     no fire to sit before.
|   [47:15] Such then have they proved unto you,
|     in whose cause you have toiled from your youth;
|   your flee staggering, each his own way –
|     not a man of them all to save you.

##### The summons to depart from Babylon #####

###### The new prophecies will be fulfilled as surely as the old ######

[Isaiah 48]

|   [48:1] Hear this, O household of Jacob,
|   called by the name of Israel,
|     and sprung from the loins of Judah,
|   who swear by the name of the LORD,
|     and celebrate Israel’s God –
|     but neither with justice or truth;
|   [48:2] for they call themselves after the holy city,
|     and lean on the God of Israel,
|     whose name is the LORD  of Hosts.

|   [48:3] Of old I announced predictions,
|     and uttered them forth from my lips:
|     of a sudden I wrought, and they came.
|   [48:4] But I knew that you were stubborn,
|     with a neck like an iron band,
|     and a forehead all of brass;
|   [48:5] so I told it you long ago:
|     ere it came to pass, I informed you:
|   in case you should claim that your idol had wrought it,
|     your images – molten or graven – appointed it.
|   [48:6] You have heard it, now see it fulfilled;
|     wilt you not bear witness to it?

#### The Restoration of Israel and the Future Glory of Zion ####

##### The servant discouraged, but at last triumphant #####

###### The servant: his seeming failure and his great destiny ######

[Isaiah 49]

|   [49:1] Hearken, you isles, unto me,
|     and you peoples from far, give attention.
|   The LORD  has called me from birth,
|     from the womb of my mother he gave me my name.

|   [49:2] Like a sharp sword made he my mouth,
|     in the shadow of his hand did he hide me;
|   he made me a polished shaft,
|     in his quiver he concealed me.

|   [49:3] And he said to me, “You are my servant,
|     in whom I will show my glory;”
|   [49:4] But I said, “I have laboured in vain,
|     I have spent my strength on an empty nothing;
|   yet safe is my cause with the LORD,
|     and my recompense with my God.”

|   [49:5] And now – thus says the LORD,
|     who formed me from birth for his servant,
|   to bring Jacob back unto him,
|     and that Israel to him might be gathered –
|   and so I had honour in the sight of the LORD,
|     my God became my strength.

|   [49:6] He says, “It is too light a thing
|     to raise up the tribes of Jacob,
|     and Israel’s dispersed to restore:
|   I will make you a light to the nations,
|     that so my salvation may reach
|     to the very ends of the earth.”

###### Israel’s happy return and restoration ######

|   [49:7] Thus says the (true) God the LORD,
|     Israel’s holy redeemer,
|   to him who of men is contemned,
|     abhorred of the nations, the servant of tyrants:
|   kings, when they see you, will rise,
|     and princes will bow down in homage,
|   because of the LORD  the faithful,
|     and Israel’s Holy One, who chose you.

|   [49:8] Thus says the LORD :
|   now will I favour and answer you,
|     now will I help and deliver you;
|   making you pledge and symbol
|     of my covenant with mankind:
|   restoring the (ruined) land,
|     and allotting the desolate heritage;
|   [49:9] bidding the prisoners go forth,
|     and the inmates of darkness to show themselves.

|   They will pasture wherever they go,
|     even on all the bare hills will be pasture;
|   [49:10] they will neither hunger nor thirst,
|     neither sun nor the hot wind will smite them.
|   For one who pities will lead them,
|     and guide them to foundations of water.
|   [49:11] I will make all the mountains a highway,
|     and roads will be raised everywhere.
|   [49:12] Lo! Yonder they come from afar,
|     some from the north and the west,
|     and some from the land of Syene.

|   [49:13] Sing, O you heavens, for joy;
|     and earth, do you exult;
|     let the mountains break forth into song.
|   For the LORD  comforts his folk,
|     takes pity upon his affected.

##### The consolation of Zion #####

###### Wasted Zion will be rebuilt and repeopled ######

|   [49:14] “But the LORD,” says Zion, “has left me;
|     my Lord has forgotten me clean.”
|   [49:15] Can a woman forget her babe,
|     cease to pity the son of her womb?
|   Yes, such may indeed forget,
|     but never will I forget you.
|   [49:16] I have graven you on my hands,
|     and your walls are for ever before me:
|   [49:17] in haste men are coming to build you;
|     while those who have torn you down
|     and laid you in ruins, will leave you.

|   [49:18] Lift up your eyes round about, and behold
|     how they flock to you, all of them gathered together.
|   Yea, thus says the LORD  on oath, as I live,
|     you will wear them upon you as jewels on a garment,
|     and bind them about you as bride binds her girdle.
|   [49:19] For your desolate wastes and your ruined land
|     (will be turned to a garden and crowded with men.)
|   Then scarce room enough you will have for your people,
|     when those who devoured you are far away.

|   [49:20] The children you long were bereft of
|     will one day declare in your ears,
|   “This place is too narrow for me,
|     give me ampler space to dwell in.”
|   [49:21] And then you will say in your heart,
|   “Who can have borne me these children?
|   Since I am bereaved and unfruitful,
|     who can have reared these children?
|   Behold! I was left all alone:
|     who then can these children be?”

##### Three words of consolation #####

###### At a signal from the Lord, the nations will bring Israel back to Zion ######

|   [49:22] Thus says the Lord the LORD :
|   behold I will lift up my hand to the nations,
|     and raise for the people my banner (as signal);
|   and then they will bring your sons in their bosom,
|     and carry your daughters upon their shoulders.
|   [49:23] Kings will be your foster-fathers,
|     and queens will be your nursing mothers;
|   with face to the earth they will do you homage,
|     and lick the dust of your feet:
|   and then you will know that I am the LORD,
|     who never will bring those who trust me to shame.

###### The Lord is omnipotent ######

|   [49:24] Can prey from the mighty be wrenched,
|     or can captives escape from a tyrant?
|   [49:25] Verily, thus says the LORD :
|   yes, even from the mighty can captives be wrenched,
|     and the prey of a tyrant escape;
|   but *I* will defend your cause,
|     *I* will deliver your children,
|   [49:26] and cause your oppressors to eat their own flesh,
|     and to drink themselves drunk with their blood as with wine.
|   And then all flesh will know
|     that I am your saviour-redeemer,
|     the LORD, the Strong One of Jacob.

###### The Lord’s omnipotent love ######

[Isaiah 50]

|   [50:1] Thus says the LORD :
|   where is the bill of your mother’s divorcement,
|     wherewith I have put her away?
|   Or which of my creditors is it
|     to whom I have ever sold you?
|   If sold you have been, ’tis because of your sins;
|     your rebellions have led to your mother’s divorce.

|   [50:2] Why, when I came, was there no one,
|     and none to respond when I called?
|   Is my hand too short to deliver?
|     And have I no power to rescue?
|   With a word of a rebuke did I dry up the sea,
|     and rivers I turned into desert;
|   their fish dried up for lack of water,
|     their monsters perished on thirsty land.
|   [50:3] I clothed the heavens in mourning,
|     and sackcloth I made their covering.

##### The servant tried but trusting #####

|   [50:4] The Lord the LORD  has given me
|     the tongue of a true disciple,
|   to know how to answer the weary
|     with words (of consolation).

|   In the morning he opens my ears
|     to listen, as true disciple;
|   [50:5] as for me, I have not been rebellious,
|     or turned me backward away.

|   [50:6] I gave my back to the lash,
|     and my cheeks unto those who plucked them;
|   my face and I did not hide
|     from insult or from spitting.

|   [50:7] For the Lord of the LORD  helps me,
|     and so I am not confounded;
|   I set my face like a flint,
|     and I know I will never be shamed.

|   [50:8] My vindicator is nigh,
|     who then dare to contend with me?
|     Let us both stand up together.
|   Who dare be my opponent?
|     Let him draw nigh unto me.

|   [50:9] See, the LORD  God is my helper;
|     where, then, is the man who can worst me?
|   They all like a garment will crumble,
|     the moth will eat them up.
|   [50:10] Let that man among you who fears the LORD
|      listen to the voice of his servant.
|   Whoso walks in darkness,
|     with not a gleam of light,
|   let him trust in the name of the LORD,
|     and lean upon his God.

|   [50:11] All you who kindle a fire,
|     and you who set brands aflame,
|   begone to the flame of your fire,
|     get you into the brands you have lighted.
|   This is your fate at my hand,
|     that you lie in the place of torment.

##### Words of encouragement and promise #####

###### Deliverance is near and sure ######

[Isaiah 51]

|   [51:1] Hearken to me, you who yearn for redress,
|     who seek for the aid of the LORD ;
|   look to the rock from which you were hewn,
|     to the quarry from which you were dug.
|   [51:2] Look unto Abraham your father,
|     and Sarah - her who bore you:
|   for he was but one, when I called him,
|     yet I blessed him and increased him.

|   [51:3] So the LORD  has comforted Zion,
|     has comforted all her ruins,
|   her desert has made like the LORD ’s own garden,
|     like Eden itself her wilderness.
|   There will joy and gladness be found,
|     giving of thanks and the sound of melody.
|   [51:4] Give heed unto me, my people,
|     O nation of mine, listen;
|   for from me will direction go forth,
|   my law to enlighten the nations.
|   [51:5] I will bring my deliverance swiftly;
|     my victory is now on the way,
|     my arms will judge the peoples.
|   For me do the islands wait,
|     they will set their hope in my arm.

|   [51:6] Lift up your eyes to the heavens,
|     and look on the earth beneath;
|   for the heavens will vanish like smoke,
|     and the earth like a garment (will perish;
|   (the world) will crumble to pieces,
|     her people will die like gnats:
|   but eternal will be my salvation,
|     my triumph will not fail.

|   [51:7] Hearken to me, you who care for the right,
|     you folk in whose heart is my teaching;
|   be not afraid of the insults of men,
|     let no their reviling dismay you:
|   [51:8] for like a garment the moth will consume them,
|     the worm will consume them like wool;
|   but eternal will be my salvation,
|     my triumph from age to age.

###### Appeal to the Lord to show his ancient power ######

|   [51:9] Awake, O arm of the LORD,
|     awake, and clothe you with might;
|   awake as in days of old,
|     as in ancient generations.
|   Are *you* not the arm that hewed Rahab in pieces,
|     and pierced the dragon through?
|   [51:10] Are *you* not the arm that once dried up the sea,
|     the waters of mighty ocean,
|   that made the depths of the sea
|     a way for the ransomed to pass?

|   [51:12] I, I am he comforts you:
|     how then should you be afraid
|   of frail man who will die, or of mortal
|     who passes away like the grass;
|   [51:13] and forgets the LORD  your maker,
|     who stretched forth the heavens and founded the earth;
|   and lives in ceaseless dread
|     of the fury of the oppressor?
|   Where is now the oppressor’s fury,
|     who aimed at your destruction?
|   [51:14] Soon will the captive be freed,
|     he will not end in death and the pit,
|     nor suffer for lack of bread.

|   [51:15] I am the LORD  your God,
|     who stirs the sea into roaring waves:
|     the LORD  of Hosts is my name.
|   [51:16] And I put my words in your mouth,
|     in the shadow of my hand did I hide you,
|   when I stretched forth the heavens and founded the earth,
|     and said unto Zion, “My people are you.”

###### Jerusalem’s affliction: her speedy redemption and glory ######

|   [51:17] Bestir you, bestir you; arise, O Jerusalem,
|     who have drunk at the hand of the LORD
|    the cup of his indignation,
|     and the bowl that bewilders have drained to the dregs.
|   [51:18] Of all the sons you have borne
|     there is not man to guide you;
|   of all the sons you have reared
|     there is none to take your hand.
|   [51:19] A twofold woe has befallen you;
|     who may with you condole?
|   Wreck and ruin, famine and sword –
|     and who may comfort you?
|   [51:20] Your sons in a swoon were lying
|     like an antelope in a net,
|   filled full with the LORD ’s fury
|     and with the rebuke of your God.
|   [51:21] Therefore hear now this, you afflicted one,
|     drunken, but not with wine:
|   [51:22] thus says your Lord the LORD,
|     your God who defends his people:
|   “Behold, from your hand I have taken
|     the cup that brings bewilderment;
|   the chalice of my fury
|     you will never drink again.
|   [51:23] I will hand it to your tormentors,
|     to those who afflicted you,
|   and commanded you to bow down
|     that they might pass over you:
|   yea, you made your back like the ground,
|     like a street for men to pass over.”

[Isaiah 52]

|   [52:1] Awake, awake, O Zion,
|     put on your garment of strength;
|   put on your glorious raiment,
|     O holy city, Jerusalem:
|   for never will enter you more
|     the uncircumcised or unclean.
|   [52:2] Shake yourself from the dust,
|     and arise, O captive Jerusalem;
|   loose you the bands of your neck,
|     O captive daughter of Zion.

 [52:3] For thus says the LORD, “You were sold for nothing and [52:4] without money you will be redeemed.” For thus says the Lord the LORD, “My people went down at the first to Egypt to sojourn there; and Assyria oppressed them [52:5] without cause. And now,” says the LORD, “wherein have I been advantaged here, in that my people have been taken away for nothing? See! Those who waited for me,” says the LORD, “are become a byword, and my name is ever ceaselessly reviled. Therefore in that day will my people know my name, that it is I who have promised. Behold, it is I.”

|   [52:7] How fair are the feet on the mountains
|     of him who proclaims good tidings,
|   the herald of peace and good tidings,
|     who brings the news of deliverance,
|   who says unto Zion,
|     “Your God reigns.”
|   [52:8] your watchmen lift up their voices
|     in jubilant cries together,
|   for eye to eye they look
|     on the LORD  returning to Zion.
|   [52:9] You ruins of wasted Jerusalem,
|     break into singing together:
|   for the LORD  comforts his people,
|     he brings Jerusalem redemption.

|   [52:10] In the sight of all nations the LORD
|      gas bared his holy arm;
|   and all the ends of the earth
|     will see how our God has saved us.
|   [52:11] Away, away. get you hence,
|     and touch no unclean thing;
|   get you forth from her, make yourselves pure,
|     you who bear the vessels of the LORD .
|   [52:12] Nor need you go forth in haste,
|     nor depart as though you were fugitives;
|   for the LORD  goes before you,
|     and Israel’s God is your rear guard.

##### The humiliation and exaltation of the servant #####

###### The servant: his sufferings and his great glory ######

|   [52:13] See, Israel my servant will yet be exalted
|     and raised exceeding high.
|   [52:14] And as many were erstwhile appalled at his fate
|     (And kings at his destiny shuddered),
|   [52:15] so many a nation will yet do him homage
|     and kings will be silent for awe of him.

|   For what they had never been told they will see,
|     they will gaze upon things unheard of before.

[Isaiah 53]

|   [53:1] “Who could have ever believed” (they will say)
|     “Such a tale as that which we hear?”
|   And to whom has the arm of the LORD
|      been ever so revealed?

###### The sorrows, humiliation, and death of the servant ######

|   [53:2] He grew like a sapling before us,
|     a shoot out of ground that was dry;
|   no beauty had he to attract us,
|     no figure to win our regard;

|   [53:3] He was spurned and forsaken of men,
|     familiar with suffering and pain;
|   as one from whom men hide their faces,
|     he was spurned and we heeded him not.

|   [53:4] But *ours* was the pain that *he* bore,
|     and the sorrows he carried were ours;
|   yet by *us* he was counted as smitten
|     and tortured by God’s own hand.
|   [53:5] But ours was the sin that pierced him,
|     the guilt that crushed him was ours:
|   yea, *he* was chastised for *our* welfare,
|     and *his* stripes brought healing to *us*.

|   [53:6] We had all of us wandered like sheep,
|     each turning a way of his own,
|   while the LORD  had laid upon *him*
|     the iniquity of us all.

|   [53:7] Though outraged, he was submissive,
|     he opened not his mouth;
|   like a lamb that is led to the slaughter,
|     or sheep that with shearers is dumb.

|   [53:8] He was dragged away by injustice,
|     and who gave a thought to his fate?
|   He was torn from the land of the living,
|     and smitten to death for the sins that were ours.

|   [53:9] His grave was appointed with rebels,
|     his funeral mound with the wicked;
|   although he had done no violence,
|     nor was any deceit in his mouth.

###### The servant’s ultimate exultation and glory ######

|   [53:10] ’Twas the will of the LORD  that crushed him with pain;
|     but by yielding himself as an offering for sin,
|   he will yet see an offspring, his days will be long,
|     and the purpose of God will through him be triumphant.

|   [53:11] For he has delivered his soul from anguish,
|     his eyes he has filled with abundance of light.”
|   “In the of the many my servant stands justified,
|     theirs is the guilt that this man bears.

|   [53:12] For this he will win with the great an inheritance,
|     he with the strong will divide the spoil;
|   because he had poured out his soul unto death,
|     and had suffered himself to be numbered with rebels;
|   though the sins that he bore were the sins of the world,
|     and for those very rebels he had offered his prayer.”

##### The future glory of Jerusalem #####

[Isaiah 54]

|   [54:1] Sing, you barren, who did not bear,
|     you who travailed not, break forth into singing;
|   for more are the sons of the woman forlorn
|     than the sons – says the LORD  – of her who is married.

|   [54:2] Enlarge the space for your tent,
|     and stretch out your canvas unstintingly;
|   lengthen your cords, and your stakes fasten well,
|   [54:3] for to right and to left you will spread.
|   Your sons will possess the nations,
|     and people the cities now desolate.

|   [54:4] Fear not, for never you will be ashamed,
|     nor put to the blush, therefore be not confounded.
|   The shame of your youth you will clean forget,
|     and remember no more the reproach of your widowhood.

|   [54:5] For your husband is he who made you,
|     the LORD  of Hosts is his name;
|   your redeemer is Israel’s Holy One,
|     the God of all the earth.

|   [54:6] As a wife forsaken and grieved
|     to himself has the LORD  recalled you;
|   can a wife wooed in youth be rejected?
|     Thus says the LORD  your God.

|   [54:7] I forsook you a little while,
|     but in great compassion I will gather you;
|   [54:8] in a burst of wrath for a moment
|     I hid my face from you,
|   but with love everlasting I pity you,
|     says the LORD  your redeemer.

|   [54:9] Like the days of Noah are these days to me:
|   as I sware that the waters of Noah
|     should no more pass over the earth,
|   so I swear I will never again
|     be angry with you, or rebuke you.

|   [54:10] Though the mountains should remove,
|     and the hills be utterly shaken,
|   yet from you will my love never move,
|   nor my covenant of peace be shaken,
|     says the LORD, who pities you.

|   [54:11] you who were sore afflicted,
|     tossed by the storm and uncomforted,
|       Behold,
|   your base I will set in rubies,
|     in sapphires your foundations.
|   [54:12] I will make your pinnacles jasper,
|     your gates of carbuncle stones,
|     and all your borders of jewels.
|   [54:13] The LORD  will teach your builders,
|     and greatly prosper your children;
|   [54:14] through righteousness you will endure.
|   Far you will be from oppression,
|     yea, you will have nothing to fear:
|   far you will be from destruction,
|     it will not come nigh unto you.
|   [54:15] If any should stir up strife,
|     it comes not from me;
|   who stirs up strife against you
|     will fall upon you to his ruin.
|   [54:16] Behold! It is I who created the smith
|     that blows the fire of coals,
|   bringing weapons forth for their work.
|     It is I who created destroyer to ravage.
|   [54:17] Success will never attend
|     the weapon forged against you;
|   the tongue that is raised against you
|     will be worsted evermore.
|   Such is the lot of the LORD ’s servants,
|     and this will I vindicate them, says the LORD .

##### Invitation to embrace the impending salvation #####

###### The blessings in store for Israel ######

[Isaiah 55]

|   [55:1] Ho! All who are thirsty, come you to the waters,
|     and you who have no money, come;
|   buy you and eat without money,
|     buy wine and milk without price.
|   [55:2] Why spend you silver for that which can satisfy no one?
|   And your money for that which can satisfy no one?
|   If you hearken to me, you will eat what is good,
|     and your soul will be ravished with dainties.

|   [55:3] Incline your ear and come unto me,
|     hear, that your soul may revive;
|   for with you I will enter a bond everlasting
|     of kindness, once promised to David and sure.
|   [55:4] For, as once to the nations I made him my witness,
|     appointing him prince and commander of nations,
|   [55:5] so now you will summon a people you know not,
|     people who know you not will run unto you,
|   for the sake of the LORD  your God,
|     the Holy One of Israel,
|     because he has girt you with glory.

###### The wonderful salvation is near: forth, then, from Babylon! ######

|   [55:6] Seek you the LORD, while he may be found,
|     call you upon him, while he is near.
|   [55:7] Let the wicked forsake his way,
|     and the sinful man his thoughts;
|   let him turn unto the LORD,
|     and he will have pity upon him –
|   and unto our God, for he 
|     will plentifully pardon.
|   [55:8] For my thoughts are not your thoughts,
|     nor are your ways mine, says the LORD :
|   [55:9] but as heaven is higher than earth,
|     so are my ways higher than your ways,
|     and my thoughts higher than your thoughts.

|   [55:10] For even as the rain and the snow
|     that descend from the heaven, return not
|   without having watered the earth,
|     and caused it to bear and sprout,
|     giving seed to the sower and bread to the eater,
|   [55:11] even so will it be with the word
|     that has issued out of my mouth:
|   it will not return to me void,
|     it will execute my pleasure,
|     and carry my mission to triumph.

|   [55:12] For with joy you will go forth,
|     and in peace you will be led out;
|   the mountains and the hills
|     will break into singing before you,
|   and all the trees of the forest
|     will clap their hands together.
|   [55:13] For the thorn will come up the fir,
|     for the brier will come up the myrtle;
|   it will be for the LORD ’s renown,
|     for a sign everlasting that never will perish.

### Later Voices of Rebuke, Threat, and Promise ###

##### A word of cheer to those who are in danger of being excluded from the church #####

[Isaiah 56]

|   [56:1] Thus says the LORD :
|   “Keep the law, and do that which is right:
|   for soon my deliverance cometh,
|     my justice will soon be revealed.”
|   [56:2] Happy the man who thus does,
|     the mortal who holds it fast –
|   he who keeps the Sabbath unsullied,
|     who keeps his hand from all evil.

|   [56:3] And let not the foreigner say,
|     who has joined himself unto the LORD,
|   “The LORD  will separate me
|     most assuredly form his people.”
|   And let not the eunuch say,
|     “Behold, a dry tree am I.”

|   [56:4] For thus says the LORD :
|     “The eunuchs who keep my Sabbaths,
|   make choice of the things I delight in,
|     and hold my covenant fast –
|   [56:5] in my house and within my walls
|     I will give them a name and a monument
|     better than sons and daughter:
|   I will give them a name everlasting
|     that never will be cut off.
|   [56:6] And the foreigners joined to the LORD,
|     who serve him and love his name,
|     and are pledged to be his servants –
|   all who keep the Sabbath unsullied
|     and hold his covenant fast –
|   [56:7] I will bring to my holy mountain;
|     and fill them with joy in my house of prayer
|   their burnt-offerings and their sacrifices
|     will be welcomed upon my altar.
|   And my house will be known by the name,
|     ’house of prayer for every nation.’”

|   [56:8] Thus says the Lord the LORD,
|     who gathers the outcasts of Israel:
|   “I will yet gather others to him
|     beside those who already are gathered.”

##### The demoralization of leaders and people #####

###### The sensuous leaders ######

|   [56:9] All you wild beasts of the field,
|     all you wild beasts of the forest,
|     come hither to devour.
|   [56:10] My watchmen are blind, every one,
|     with no knowledge of how to give heed.
|   Dumb dogs they are, every one of them,
|     lacking the power to bark;
|   but there they lie a-dreaming
|     in the slumber that they love.

|   [56:11] Yes, greedy dogs are they,
|     that never can have enough;
|   but each to his own way turns,
|     each on his own gain bent:
|   [56:12] “Come, wine let us fetch” (they say),
|     “let us fill ourselves with drink,
|   and tomorrow will be as today,
|     a royal uproarious day.”

[Isaiah 57]

|   [57:1] The righteous are being destroyed,
|     and no man lays it to heart;
|   the godly are swept away,
|     and no man gives it a thought.
|   ’Tis the wickedness prevailing
|     that sweeps the righteous away;
|   [57:2] but he enters into peace,
|     and those whose walk has been upright
|     do rest at last on their biers.

###### The idolatrous people ######

|   [57:3] But *you* – hither approach,
|     you children of a sorcerers;
|   you offspring of whore and adulterer,
|   [57:4] whom are you making sport of?
|   At whom are you making wide mouths,
|     and putting out our tongue?
|   Are you not apostate children,
|     a very brood of falsehood,
|   [57:5] who inflame yourselves at the oaks,
|     and under each green tree;
|   who in valleys slaughter children
|     amidst the clefts of the rocks?

|   [57:6] The slippery gods of the valley –
|     those, those you have taken for your portion.
|   Yes, to them you have poured your drink-offerings
|     and rendered on oblation:
|     and should I with such things be appeased?
|   [57:7] And you did set your bed
|     on a high and lofty mountain,
|   and thither you did go
|     to offer up your sacrifice.

|   [57:8] Behind the door and the door-posts
|     your symbol you did set;
|   inflamed, you did uncover,
|     did go up and enlarge your bed.
|   And you did purchase you lovers,
|   whose wantonness you loved;
|   and did multiply your whoredoms,
|     when your eyes beheld the phallus.

|   [57:9] For Melech you did anoint you
|     and multiply your perfumes;
|   you did send your ambassadors far,
|     yea, down to the depths of Sheol.
|   [57:10] Though weary with many journeys,
|     you said not, “I despair.”
|   But ever new strength you gained,
|     and therefore you did not desist.

|   [57:11] Of whom were you then in such abject terror
|     that you did play the traitor,
|   and gave no thought to me,
|     nor did lay your duty to heart?
|   I hid my eyes in silence,
|     and me you did not fear.
|   [57:12] But I will expose your doings,
|     this “righteousness” of yours.

|   [57:13] When you cry, your hateful idols
|     will profit you nothing, nor save you;
|   the wind will lift them all,
|     and a breath will take them away.
|   But who trusts in me will possess the land,
|     and inherit my holy mountain.

##### Blessings in store for the faithful #####

|   [57:14] O raise, raise a highway, and clear you a path,
|     take the stumbling-blocks out of the way of my people.
|   [57:15] For thus says he who is high and exalted,
|     whose throne is for ever, whose name is holy:
|   “On high as the Holy One sit I enthroned,
|     and with him who is crushed, who is lowly in spirit;
|   to quicken the spirit of them who are lowly,
|     and the heart of all such as crushed to revive.

|   [57:16] For not for ever will I contend,
|     nor cherish my anger evermore;
|   for then would the spirits faint before me,
|     the souls that I myself have made.
|   [57:17] Because of his sin I was worth for a moment,
|     I smote him in anger and hid my face:
|   but he kept to the way of his rebel heart –
|   [57:18] I have noted his ways,” says the LORD .

|   “But now will I bring to him healing and rest,
|     and requite him with full consolation.
|   [57:19] The lips of his mourners will blossom with praise,
|     when to far and to near I bring peace and prosperity,
|   whose waters cast up mire and dirt.”
|     [57:21] So peace there is none, says my God, to the wicked.

##### The true and the false worship #####

###### Fasting ######

[Isaiah 58]

|   [58:1] Cry with full throat and refrain not,
|     lift up your voice like a trumpet;
|   declare to my people their sins,
|     and their guilt to the household of Jacob.
|   [58:2] Daily indeed they consult me,
|     their joy is to learn my ways,
|   like a nation that does the right
|     and forsaken not the law of its God.

|   They ask me to guide then aright,
|     they delight to draw nigh unto God.
|   [58:3] “Why look you not when we fast?” (they say)
|     “Why heed you not our self-chastening?”
|   But on fast-days you think of your business,
|     you drive all your workmen like slaves.
|   [58:4] See! you fast for strife and contention,
|     you smite the poor with your fists.

|   Such fasting as yours today
|     will not carry your prayers on high.
|   [58:5] Can such be the fast of my choice,
|     a day for self-mortification?
|   To bow one’s head like a bulrush,
|     to lie upon sackcloth and ashes –
|   is this what you call a fast,
|     a day that the LORD  accepts?
|  
|   [58:6] Thus says the Lord the LORD :
|     is the fast of my choice not this –
|   to loose the unjust fetters,
|     to undo the bands of the yoke,
|   to let those who are crushed go free,
|     and to snap each yoke in sunder,
|   [58:7] to break your bread to the hungry,
|     to bring the homeless home: –
|   when you see the naked, to cover him,
|     and to hide not yourself from your kinsmen?
|   [58:8] Then will your light break forth as the dawn,
|     and your wounds will be speedily healed.
|   In front will your righteousness march,
|     with the LORD ’s own glory behind you.
|   [58:9] Then, when you call, the LORD  will answer,
|     and say, when you cry for help, “Here am I.”
|  
|   If from your midst you remove the yoke,
|     the finger of scorn and the speech that is mischievous;
|   [58:10] if to the hungry you give your bread,
|     and the soul that is bowed you satisfy:
|   then in the darkness your light will arise,
|     and your gloom will be as the noonday:
|   [58:11] the LORD  will guide you for evermore,
|     and your soul in the land that is parched he will satisfy.
|   Your strength he will make new again,
|     and you like a well-watered garden will be,
|     like a fountain of water, whose waters fail not.
|   [58:12] The ancient ruins your sons will rebuild,
|     you will rear once again the foundations of old;
|   and you will be called the repairer of ruins,
|     who makes waste places a home again.

###### The Sabbath ######

|   [58:13] If you turn away your foot from the Sabbath,
|     from doing your business on my holy day,
|   and call the Sabbath a sheer delight,
|     and the holy (day) of the LORD  honourable,
|   and honour it by not doing your wont,
|     nor heeding your business, nor speaking idly:
|   [58:14] then you will have your delight in the LORD,
|     and over the heights of the earth you will ride;
|   I will give you the portion of Jacob your father
|     in full to enjoy, as the LORD  has promised.

##### The sinful people and the devine deliverance #####

###### The sins ######

[Isaiah 59]

|   [59:1] Behold, the hands of the LORD
|      is not too short to save,
|     nor his ear too dull to hear.
|   [59:2] Your iniquities are the barrier
|     between your God and you;
|   your sins have hidden his face,
|     and therefore he will not hear you.

|   [59:3] For your hands are stained with blood,
|     and your fingers with iniquity;
|   your lips have uttered falsehood,
|     your tongue mutters depravity.
|   [59:4] No one sues the integrity,
|     no one with honesty pleads;
|   they trust in pretence and lies,
|     conceive trouble and bring forth mischief.

|   [59:5] Basilisks’ eggs they hatch,
|     and spiders’ webs they weave:
|   who eats their eggs will die,
|     and the egg that is crushed breaks out as a viper.
|   [59:6] Their webs cannot serve as a garment,
|     with that which they fabricate no man can clothe himself;
|   for evil is what they fabricate,
|     their hands work deeds of violence.

|   [59:7] Their feet run to evil,
|     they haste to shed innocent blood;
|   their thoughts are thoughts of mischief,
|     their paths are wreck and ruin.
|   [59:8] The ways of peace they know not,
|     no justice is in their tracks:
|   for their own selfish ends they have twisted their paths;
|     who treads thereon is a stranger to peace.

###### The confession ######

|   [59:9] For this cause our right remains far,
|     and no victory yet overtakes us;
|   we look for the light, but lo! Darkness –
|     for brightness, but walk in the gloom.
|   [59:10] We grope, like the blind, by the wall,
|     yea, like men who are sightless we grope;
|   we stumble at noon as in twilight,
|     in darkness we dwell like the dead.
|   [59:11] We all of us roar like bears,
|     like doves we sadly mourn;
|   we look – but in vain – for justice,
|     salvation is far away.

|   [59:12] Our transgressions before you are many,
|     our sins do witness against us,
|   our transgressions are ever with us,
|     we know our iniquities well –
|   [59:13] rebellion, denial of the LORD,
|     and turning away from our God,
|   speaking revolt and perverseness,
|   and uttering lies from the heart.
|   [59:14] Justice is driven back,
|     and righteousness stands afar;
|   in the market-place truth stumbles,
|     and rectitude cannot enter.
|   [59:15] So truth is not to be found,
|     and insight departs from the city.
|   At the sight was the LORD  displeased,
|     he was angry that justice was lacking.

###### The deliverance ######

|   [59:16] He saw with utter amaze
|     not a man to interpose;
|   so his own arm wrought him deliverance,
|     his righteous might upheld him.
|   [59:17] He put on the breastplate of righteousness,
|     on his head the helm of salvation;
|   he put on the garments of vengeance,
|     in the mantle of passion he clothed him.

|   [59:18] He renders recompense matching desert –
|     wrath to his enemies, shame to his foes:
|   [59:19] so will those in the west fear the name of the LORD,
|     and those at the sunrise behold his glory.
|   He will come like a pent-up stream,
|     which the breath of the LORD  drives.
|   [59:20] But to Zion he comes as redeemer,
|     and removes transgressors from Jacob.

|   [59:21] This covenant with them I make, says the LORD  –
|   my spirit that is upon you,
|     and the words I have put in your mouth –
|   will not depart form your mouth,
|     nor from the mouth of your children,
|   nor yet from the mouth of your children’s children,
|     says the LORD, from the henceforth and evermore.

##### The glory of the new Jerusalem #####

[Isaiah 60]

|   [60:1] Arise, shine, for your light is now come,
|     and on *you* is the LORD ’s own glory arisen.
|   [60:2] For, though darkness covers the earth,
|     and the nations are wrapped in gloom,
|   yet on *you* the LORD  shines forth,
|     over *you* his glory appears.
|   [60:3] And nations will come to the light that *you* shed,
|     and kings to the brightness that streams from *you*.
|   [60:4] Lift up your eyes round bout and behold
|     how they flock to you, all of them gathered together –
|   your sons coming in from afar,
|     on the arms of their nurses your daughters.
|   [60:5] At the sight of them you will be radiant,
|     your heart will tremble and throb;
|   for the wealth of the sea will be turned unto you,
|     unto you will the nations come in with their treasures.

|   [60:6] A stream of camels will cover you,
|     young camels of Midian and Ephah;
|   all those of Sheba will come,
|     laden with gold and frankincense,
|     and tell of the LORD ’s renown.
|   [60:7] All the flocks of Kedar
|     will gather unto you,
|     and the rams of Nebaioth will seek you;
|   they will mount with acceptance my altar,
|     and my house of prayer will be radiant with beauty.

|   [60:8] Who are these that fly like a cloud,
|     or like doves to their latticed cotes?
|   [60:9] For ships unto me are gathering –
|     vessels of Tarshish in front –
|   to bring your sons from afar,
|     and with them their silver and gold,
|   to the name of the LORD  your God,
|     to the Holy One of Israel,
|     because he has girt you with glory.

|   [60:10] Strangers will build your walls,
|     and their kings unto you will be ministers;
|   for the wrath that moved me to smite you
|     is turned into favour and pity.
|   [60:11] Your gates will ever be open,
|     not shut by day or nigh,
|   that the wealth of nations be brought you –
|     their kings at the head of the train.
|   [60:12] For the nation and the kingdom
|     that serve you not will perish:
|     yea, utterly waste will those nations be.

|   [60:13] The glory of Lebanon will come unto you,
|     the pine-tree, the plane, and the cypress together,
|   that the House where my holiness dwells may be fair,
|     that the place where I walk may be covered with glory.
|   [60:14] The sons of those who afflicted and scorned you
|     will come unto you, all lowly bending,
|   and give you the name of “the LORD ’s own city,
|     the Zion of Israel’s Holy One.”

|   [60:15] Whereas you have been forsaken,
|     unvisited, abhorred,
|   an eternal pride I make you,
|     a joy unto all generations.
|   [60:16] You will suck the milk of nations,
|     yea, royal breasts you will suck;
|   and then you will know that I,
|     the LORD, am your saviour,
|   and he who redeems you
|     is the Mighty One of Jacob.

|   [60:17] For brass I will bring in gold,
|     and silver instead of iron,
|   brass in the place of wood,
|     and iron in place of stones;
|   and peace I will set to govern you,
|     and justice to be your lord.
|   [60:18] Violence will no more be heard in your land,
|     nor rapine nor ruin within your borders;
|   but a sure defence you will call your walls,
|     and your gates you will name renown.

|   [60:19] The sin will no more be your light by day,
|     nor yet will the moon shed her brightness upon you;
|   but the LORD  will be your eternal light,
|     and your God will be your glory.
|   [60:20] Your sun will set no more,
|     your moon will wane no more;
|   for the LORD  will be your eternal light,
|     and the days if your grief will be ended.

|   [60:21] Your people will all be righteous,
|     possessing the land for ever,
|   the shoot of the LORD ’s planting,
|     the work of his hands, for his glory.
|   [60:22] The smallest will grow to a clan,
|     and the least to a mighty nation.
|   I (who have promised), the LORD,
|     will hasten it in its time.

##### The proclamation of Zion’s redemption #####

[Isaiah 61]

|   [61:1] The spirit of the LORD  the Lord is upon me,
|     because I have been by the LORD  anointed:
|   he has sent to me to bring glad news to the wretched,
|     to bind up hearts that are broken,
|   to proclaim release unto captives,
|     and freedom to men in bonds,
|   [61:2] to proclaim the year of the LORD ’s favour,
|     and the day of our God’s revenge,
|   to comfort all who mourn,
|     [61:3] to give them a garland for ashes,
|   the oil of joy for the garment of mourning,
|     a song of praise for a spirit bedimmed;
|   and oak-trees of righteousness they will be called,
|     the plants of the LORD  reflecting his glory.

|   [61:4] They will build the ancient ruins,
|     restoring the places long desolate,
|   renewing the wasted cities,
|     that age upon age have been desolate.
|   [61:5] Strangers will stand and feed your flocks,
|     and foreigners will be your ploughmen and vine-dressers:
|   [61:6] but *you* will be called the priests of the LORD,
|     the name you will bear will be ministers of our God.
|   The wealth of the nations will be yours to enjoy,
|     you will deck yourselves with their splendour.

|   [61:7] A twofold measure of shame has been theirs,
|     and theirs was a lot of contempt and insult,
|   so now in their own land their share will be doubled,
|     and theirs will be joy everlasting.
|   [61:8] For I am the LORD, the lover of justice,
|     iniquitous plunder is hateful to me;
|   faithfully then their reward I will give them,
|     and enter with them in a bond everlasting.

|   [61:9] Their sons will be famous all over the world,
|     and their offspring among the nations;
|   then those who behold them will all acknowledge
|     that this is the race that the LORD  has blessed.
|   [61:10] For as surely as earth puts forth her shoots,
|     and the seed springs up that is sown in a garden,
|   the LORD  the Lord will make victory spring,
|     and renown, before all the world.

|   [61:11] “I will greatly rejoice in the LORD,
|     my soul will exult in my God,
|   who has clothed me in robes of salvation,
|     and decked me with mantle of victory,
|   like bridegroom who fixes his turban
|     or bride who adorns herself with her jewels.”

[Isaiah 62]

|   [62:1] For Zion’s sake I will not keep silence,
|     for Jerusalem’s sake I will not rest,
|   till her victory issue forth clear as the light,
|     her deliverance bright as a burning torch,
|   [62:2] so that nations will see you are victor indeed,
|     and kings, every one, will behold your glory.
|   But you will be called by a name that is new,
|     which the LORD ’s mouth will determine.
|   [62:3] Fair crown you will be in the hand of the LORD,
|     a diadem royal in the hand of your God.

|   [62:4] No more will your name be forsaken,
|     nor your land called desolate more:
|   but your name will be called my delight,
|     and your land my wedded wife;
|   for the LORD  delights in you,
|     and your land will indeed be wedded.
|   [62:5] For even as a youth weds a maiden,
|     so your builder will wed with you;
|   and as bridegroom rejoices in bride,
|     so your God will rejoice over you.

|   [62:6] Over your walls, Jerusalem,
|     I have appointed watchmen;
|   all the day and night
|     they never hold their peace.
|   You whose task it is
|     to keep the LORD  in mind,
|     [62:7] take to yourselves no rest,
|   and give no rest unto him,
|     until that he establish,
|   until that he make Jerusalem
|     renowned in the earth.
|   [62:8] By his right hand the LORD  has sworn,
|     and by his mighty arm:
|   “Never again will I suffer
|     your foes to devour your corn;
|   never again will strangers
|     drink the wine for which you have toiled.
|   [62:9] But those who have garnered will eat it,
|     with songs of praise to the LORD ;
|   and those who have gathered will drink it
|     within my holy courts.”

|   [62:10] Pass you, pass through the gates,
|     prepare you a way for the people;
|   cast you, cast up the highway,
|     and gather out the stones,
|     and raise for the peoples a banner.
|   [62:11] Behold, to the ends of the earth
|     has the LORD  made proclamation:
|   say to the daughter of Zion,
|     behold, your salvation is come.
|   Behold his reward is with him,
|     and his recompense before him,
|   [62:12] they will call them the holy people,
|     the redeemed of the LORD,
|   and you will be called frequented,
|     the city unforsaken.

##### The destruction of the foes of Zion #####

[Isaiah 63]

|   [63:1] “Who is this who comes from Edom,
|     in bright-red garments from Bozrah,
|   so glorious in his apparel,
|     marching in fullness of strength?”
|   “It is I, who have promised deliverance,
|     I who am mighty to save.”

|   [63:2] “Why is your raiment so red,
|     and your garments like his who treads in the wine-press?”
|   [63:3] “I have trodden the wine-trough alone,
|     of the nations was no man with me;
|   so I trod them in my anger,
|     and trampled them down in my fury;
|   their life-blood besprinkled my garments,
|     and all my apparel I stained.

|   [63:4] In my heart was the day of revenge,
|     and the year of redemption was come.
|   [63:5] I looked with utter amaze –
|     there was none to help or uphold;
|   so my own arm, wrought me the victory,
|     my fury – it upheld me.
|   [63:6] In my anger I trod down the peoples,
|     in my fury I broke them in pieces:
|     their life-blood I spilt on the ground.”

##### Passionate prayer for the divine favour #####

###### Thanksgiving for ancient mercies ######

|   [63:7] The LORD ’s renown I would celebrate –
|     all his loving-kindness –
|   as befits the deeds that the LORD,
|     so rich in goodness, has wrought for us,
|     even for the household of Israel –
|   wrought for us in his pity
|     and loving-kindness great.
|   [63:8] “Surely my people are they,” he said,
|     “sons who will not prove false.”
|   And so he became their saviour
|     from all that did distress them.

|   [63:9] No envoy was it or angel,
|     but his own very presence that saved them:
|   in his love and in his pity
|     he did himself redeem them;
|   he took them up and carried them
|     all the days of old.
|   [63:10] But as for them, they resisted,
|     and grieved his holy spirit;
|   so he turned to be their foe,
|     and himself did fight against them.

|   [63:11] Then (Israel) remembered
|     the days of the old time, (and said):
|   “Where is he who brought up from the sea
|     the shepherd of his flock?
|   And where is he who set
|     in their midst his holy spirit;
|   [63:12] who caused his glorious arm
|     to go at the right hand of Moses;
|   who cleft the waters before them,
|     to make him a name everlasting;
|  
|   13 who led them through the depths:
|   like a wild horse in open country
|     sure-footed, never stumbling.
|   [63:14] like cattle that descend to the valley,
|     the LORD ’s spirit guiding them to rest.
|   This was the way you lead your people,
|     bring glory to your name.”

###### Passionate entreaty for the devine forgiveness and pity ######

|   [63:15] Look down from heaven, and behold
|     from your holy and glorious palace.
|   Where are your zeal and your prowess,
|     the voice of your yearning and pity?
|   [63:16] Though Abraham knows us not,
|     and Israel does not regard us,
|   yet are you, O LORD, our father,
|     our redeemer from of old is your name.

|   [63:17] Why do you leave us, LORD,
|     to wander away from your paths?
|   And why do you suffer our hearts
|     to grow hard and strange to your fear?
|   O return for your servants’ sake,
|     for the sake of the tribes of your heritage.
|   [63:18] Why do the wicked make light of your holy place?
|     Why do our enemies tread down your Temple?
|   [63:19] We are grown like those whom you rule no more,
|     who have never been called by your name.

[Isaiah 64]

|   [64:1] O that the heavens you would rend and come down,
|     that the mountains might quake at your presence –
|   [64:2] As fire sets brushwood ablaze,
|     as fire causes water to boil –
|   to make known your name to your foes
|     so that nations might tremble before you,
|   [64:3] while terrible things you do,
|     surpassing our expectations,
|   [64:4] unheard-of from olden time!
|   No ear has ever heard,
|     no eye has ever seen,
|   the mighty deeds you will do
|     for those who wait for you.
|   [64:5] O that you would meet
|     with those who are doers of righteousness,
|     those who remember your ways!
|   But behold, you were wroth with our sin,
|     and of broken faith were we guilty.

|   [64:6] We are all like men defiled,
|     like a blood-stained cloth is our righteousness;
|   we are all like withered leaves,
|     swept away by the blast of our guilt.
|   [64:7] There is none who calls on your name,
|     or bestirs himself to lay hold of you.
|   For your face you have hidden from us,
|     and delivered us up to our guilt.

|   [64:8] But now, O LORD, our father are you;
|     we are the clay, and you are the potter,
|     the work of your hand are we all.
|   [64:9] O be not, LORD, exceeding wroth,
|     and do not remember our guilt for ever.
|   Behold, look, we beseech you,
|     for we are all your people.

|   [64:10] your holy cities are now a desert,
|     Jerusalem is accursed.
|   [64:11] Our holy and beautiful house,
|     wherein our fathers praised you,
|     has been burned up with fire;
|   and all the places we cherished
|     are lying now in ruins.
|   [64:12] At things like these, O LORD,
|     can you restrain yourself?
|   And will you still keep silence,
|     and afflict us very sore?

##### The blessedness of the faithful and the doom of the apostates #####

###### The fate of the apostates ######

[Isaiah 65]

|   [65:1] I was ready to offer an answer
|     to those who consulted me not;
|   and to suffer myself to be found
|     of those who had sought me not.
|   “Here am I, here am I,” I said
|     to a people who call not upon me.

|   [65:2] I spread out my hands all the day
|     to a rebel unruly people,
|   who walk in a way not good,
|     but after their own devices –
|   [65:3] A people who even to my face
|     continually provoke me,
|   sacrificing in gardens
|     and burning incense on tiles –
|   [65:4] who sit among the graves,
|     and spend the night in caves,
|   who eat the flesh of swine
|     and unclean broth from their vessels –
|   [65:5] who say, “Keep by yourself,
|     keep away from me, lest I infect you.”
|   Such men are a smoke in my nostrils,
|     a fire that blazes for ever.
|   [65:6] Behold, it is written before me:
|     I will not, says the LORD, keep silence,
|   [65:7] until I have punished their guilt
|     and the guilt of their fathers together,
|   who have burned on the mountains incense,
|     and dishonoured me on the hills.
|   So first their reward I will measure,
|     then into their bosom requite it.

###### The destiny of the faithful in the impending judgment ######

|   [65:8] Thus says the LORD :
|     as when new wine is found in the cluster,
|   and one says, “Destroy it not,
|     because it contains a blessing;”
|   Even so will I do for my servants’ sake,
|     I will not destroy the whole.
|   [65:9] I will bring out of Jacob a seed
|     and from Judah and heir to my mountains:
|   the land will be owned by my chosen,
|     and there will my servants dwell.
|   [65:10] And Sharon will then be a pasture for flocks,
|     and the valley of Anchor for cattle to rest in,
|     for my people who have sought me.
|   [65:11] But you who forsake the LORD,
|     and forget my holy mountain,
|   who spread forth a table for fortune,
|     and pour out mixed wine unto destiny:
|   [65:12] I destine you for the sword,
|     you will all bow down to the slaughter.

|   For you answered not when I called,
|     I spake, but you did not listen;
|   you did that which was vile in my sight,
|     and made choice of the things that displeased me.
|   [65:13] Therefore thus says the Lord the LORD :
|   behold, my servants will eat,
|     but you will be hungry;
|   behold, my servants will drink,
|     but you will be thirsty;
|   behold, my servants will be joyful,
|     but you will be ashamed.
|   [65:14] Behold, my servants will shout
|     for gladness of heart;
|   but for sorrow of heart *you* will cry,
|     you will wail for vexation of spirit.
|   [65:15] Behold, you will leave your name
|     for my chosen to curse by:
|   behold, by a far other name
|     will my servants be called.

|   [65:16] He who prays in the land for a blessing
|     will appeal to the God of truth;
|   and he who swears in the land
|     will swear by the God of truth –
|   when the former distress is forgotten
|     and hidden from my eyes:
|   [65:17] for behold I will soon create
|     the heavens and the earth anew.

###### The glorious future ######

|   The past will not be remembered,
|     nor come into mind again;
|   [65:18] but men will for ever rejoice and exult
|     over this my (new) creation.
|   For behold! I will straightway create
|     Jerusalem a rejoicing,
|     and her people an exultation;
|   [65:19] for I will exult in Jerusalem,
|     and in my people rejoice.

|   No more will be heard within her
|     the voice of weeping or crying,
|   [65:20] no more will be found there
|     a baby of a few brief days,
|   or an old man who has not completed
|     the full tale of his days.
|   But he who dies the youngest
|     will have lived for a hundred years,
|   and he who dies less than a hundred
|     will be counted a man accursed.

|   [65:21] They will dwell in the homes they have built,
|     eat the fruit of the vines they have planted;
|   [65:22] no others will dwell in the homes your have built,
|     nor will others enjoy what they planted.
|   For the days of my folk will be many
|     as the days of the life of a tree,
|   and the work that their hands have achieved
|     will my chosen enjoy to the end.

|   [65:23] They will not labour in vain,
|     nor rear their children to perish;
|   for a race that is blest of the LORD  are they,
|     and their offspring will live by their side.
|   [65:24] I will answer or ever they call,
|     I will hearken while still they are speaking.
|   [65:25] The wolf and the lamb will then pasture together,
|     and the lion eat straw like the ox:
|     but the serpent – its food will be dust.
|   None will do hurt, says the LORD, or havoc,
|     on all my holy mountain.

###### Doom pronounced upon those who intend to build a rival temple ######

[Isaiah 66]

|   [66:1] Thus says the LORD :
|     the heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool;
|   what manner of house would you build me?
|     What manner of home would you rear?
|   [66:2] For all this is the work of my hand,
|     and these things are all mine, says the LORD .
|   But this is the man I regard –
|     the afflicted and broken in spirit,
|     who trembles at my word.

|   [66:3] Oxen they kill forsooth –
|     but men they also slay;
|   and sheep they sacrifice –
|     but dogs they also strangle:
|   they offer their oblations –
|     but also the blood of swine;
|   they bring their memorial incense,
|     but they also bless the idol.

|   Such are the ways *they* have chosen,
|     foul rites are the joy of their soul;
|   [66:4] so *I* choose that *they* will be harassed,
|     the things that they dread I will bring on them:
|   because, when I called, none responded;
|     they listened not, when I spoke,
|   but did that which was vile in my sight,
|     and made choice of the things that displeased me.

###### The faithful cheered by the prospect of Zion’s prosperity ######

|   [66:5] Hear you the word of the LORD,
|     you who at *His* word tremble:
|   your brethren, who hate you and loathe you
|     for my name’s sake, have said:
|   “Let the LORD  show forth his glory
|     that we too may look on your joy.”
|     But *they* will put to shame.
|   [66:6] Hark! From the city an uproar.
|     Hark! From the Temple it comes.
|   Hark! ’tis the LORD  himself
|     dealing recompense unto his foes.

|   [66:7] But *she* has brought forth a son
|     before her hour of travail;
|   before her pains came upon her,
|     of a man-child was she delivered.
|   [66:8] Who has heard the like?
|     Who has seen aught like this?
|   Can it be that a single day
|     may see the birth of a people,
|     that a nation be born all at once?
|   For no sooner had Zion travailed
|     than she brought her sons to the birth.

|   [66:9] Would *I* ever not help to bring forth
|     what I bring to the birth? says the LORD .
|   Or would I, having brought to the birth,
|     then close up the womb? says your God.
|   [66:10] O Jerusalem, rejoice,
|     and exult in her, all you who love her.
|   Be joyful with her exceedingly,
|     all you who mourned over her;
|   [66:11] that so you may suck to the full
|     from the breasts of her consolations,
|   and drain to your heart’s delight
|     the milk of her rich mother-bosom.
|   [66:12] For thus says the LORD : behold,
|     I will set prosperity flowing
|   towards her, like a river in spate,
|     and the wealth of the world like a torrent.
|   Your babes will be borne on the side
|     and dandled upon the knees;
|   [66:13] and as one whom his mother comforts,
|     so will I comfort you:
|     in Jerusalem you will be comforted.
|   [66:14] Your heart will rejoice at the sight,
|     and your bones will flourish like grass;
|   and then will men perceive
|     how the LORD  loves his servants,
|     and how wroth he can be with his foes.
|   [66:15] For behold, the LORD  will come like a fire,
|     with chariots like the whirlwind,
|   to render his anger in burning heat,
|     his rebuke in flames of fire.

|   [66:16] For judgment the LORD  will hold on all flesh,
|     by fire and by his sword,
|     and the LORD ’s slain will be many.
|   [66:17] Those who devote themselves
|     by rites of purification
|   to (worship in sacred) gardens,
|     with one in the centre to lead them –
|   who eat the flesh of swine,
|     of creatures that crawl, and mice –
|   [66:18] their works and their thoughts, says the LORD,
|     will come to an end together.

###### The Lord’s glory announced throughout the world: the complete restoration and perpetuity of Israel ######

|   Behold, the time is come
|     to gather all nations and tongues;
|   they will come and behold my glory,
|   [66:19] and a sign I will set among them.
|   And those who escape (the judgment)
|     I will send unto distant coasts,
|   such as have not heard of my fame,
|     nor yet have seen my glory.
|   They will tell to the nations my glory;
|   [66:20] and out of all the nations
|     they will all your brethren bring,
|   unto my holy mountain,
|     to Jerusalem, says the LORD,
|   as an offering unto the LORD,
|     like the offerings brought to the Temple
|     by Israel in vessels pure.

|   [66:21] Some I will also take,
|     for Levitical priests, says the LORD .
|   [66:22] For as surely as the heavens
|     and the earth I create anew
|   will abide, says the LORD, before me,
|     your name and your race will continue.

###### The fearful fate of the apostates ######

|   [66:23] From one new moon to another,
|     one Sabbath to another,
|   will all flesh come to worship
|     before me, says the LORD .
|   [66:24] And forth they will go, and look
|     on the corpses of the men
|     who have rebelled against me –
|   whose worm never dies,
|     whose fire is never quenched:
|     they are held by all flesh in abhorrence.% Open English Bible

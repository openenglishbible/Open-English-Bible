{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 24}These men had been sent from the Pharisees;{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 25}and their next question was, \uc1\u8220*Why then do you baptize, if you are not the Christ or Elijah or \uc1\u8216*the prophet\uc1\u8217*?\uc1\u8221*{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 26}John\uc1\u8217*s answer was \uc1\u8211* \uc1\u8220*I baptize with water, but among you stands one whom you do not know;{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 27}he is coming after me, yet I am not worthy even to unfasten his sandal.\uc1\u8221*{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 28}This happened at Bethany, across the Jordan, where John was baptizing.

{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 35}The next day, when John was standing with two of his disciples,{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 36}he looked at Jesus as he passed and exclaimed, \uc1\u8220*There is the Lamb of God!\uc1\u8221*{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 37}The two disciples heard him say this, and followed Jesus.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 38}But Jesus turned around, and saw them following. \uc1\u8220*What are you looking for?\uc1\u8221* he asked. \uc1\u8220*Rabbi,\uc1\u8221* they answered (or, as we should say, \uc1\u8216*Teacher\uc1\u8217*), \uc1\u8220*where are you staying?\uc1\u8221*

I know that it is Jesus, who was crucified, for whom you are looking.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 6}He is not here; for he has risen, as he said he would.

The women went up to him, and clasped his feet, bowing to the ground before him. Then Jesus said to them,{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 10}\uc1\u8220*Do not be afraid; go and tell my brothers and sisters to set out for Galilee, and they will see me there.\uc1\u8221*{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 11}While they were still on their way, some of the guard came into the city, and reported to the chief priests everything that had happened.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 12}So they and the elders met and, after holding a consultation, gave a large sum of money to the soldiers,{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 13}and told them to say that his disciples came in the night, and stole him while they were asleep;{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 14}\uc1\u8220*And should this matter come before the Governor,\uc1\u8221* they added, \uc1\u8220*we will satisfy him, and see that you have nothing to fear.\uc1\u8221*{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 15}So the soldiers took the money, and did as they were instructed.

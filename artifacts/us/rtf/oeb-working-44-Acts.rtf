{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24 
{\cf1\f1\fs22 1}The first account which I drew up, Theophilus, dealt with all that Jesus did and taught from the very first,{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 2}down to that day on which he was taken up to heaven, after he had, by the help of the Holy Spirit, given instructions to the apostles whom he had chosen.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 3}With abundant proofs, he showed himself to them, still living, after his death; appearing to them from time to time during forty days, and speaking of all that related to the kingdom of God.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 4}And once, when he had gathered them together, he charged them not to leave Jerusalem, but to wait there for the fulfillment of the Father\uc1\u8217*s promise \uc1\u8211* \uc1\u8220*that promise,\uc1\u8221* he said, \uc1\u8220*of which you have heard me speak;{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 5}for, while John baptized with water, you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit before many days have passed.\uc1\u8221*
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi360 
{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 6}So, when the apostles had met together, they asked Jesus this question \uc1\u8211* \uc1\u8220*Master, is this the time when you intend to re-establish the kingdom for Israel?\uc1\u8221*{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 7}His answer was, \uc1\u8220*It is not for you to know times or hours, for the Father has reserved these for his own decision;{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 8}but you will receive power, when the Holy Spirit will have descended on you, and will be witnesses for me not only in Jerusalem, but throughout Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.\uc1\u8221*
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi360 
{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 9}No sooner had Jesus said this than he was caught up before their eyes, and a cloud received him from their sight.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 10}While they were still gazing up into the heavens, as he went, suddenly two men, clothed in white, stood beside them,{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 11}and said, \uc1\u8220*People of Galilee, why are you standing here looking up into the heavens? This same Jesus, who has been taken from you into the heavens, will come in the same way in which you have seen him go into the heavens.\uc1\u8221*
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi360 
{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 12}Then the apostles returned to Jerusalem from the hill called Olivet, which is about three quarters of a mile from the city.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 13}When they reached Jerusalem, they went to the upstairs room, where they were staying. There were there Peter, John, James, and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus, Simon the Zealot, and Judas the son of James.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 14}They all united in devoting themselves to prayer, and so did some women, and Mary, the mother of Jesus, and his brothers.

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi360 
{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 15}About this time, at a meeting of the Lord\uc1\u8217*s followers, when there were about a hundred and twenty present, Peter rose to speak.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 16}\uc1\u8220*Friends,\uc1\u8221* he said, \uc1\u8220*it was necessary that the prediction of scripture should be fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit made by the lips of David about Judas, who acted as guide to the men who arrested Jesus,{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 17}for he was one of our number and had his part allotted him in this work of ours.\uc1\u8221*{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 18}(This man had bought a piece of land with the price of his treachery; and, falling heavily, his body had burst open, and all his bowels protruded.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 19}This became known to everyone living in Jerusalem, so that the field came to be called, in their language, \uc1\u8216*Akeldama,\uc1\u8217* which means the \uc1\u8216*Field of Blood.\uc1\u8217*)

{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 21}Therefore, from among the men who have been with us all the time that Jesus, our Master, went in and out among us \uc1\u8211*{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 22}from his baptism by John down to that day on which he was taken from us \uc1\u8211* someone must be found to join us as a witness of his resurrection.\uc1\u8221*{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 23}So they put forward two men, Joseph called Barsabbas, whose other name was Justus, and Matthias;{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 24}and they offered this prayer \uc1\u8211*

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi0

{\cf1\f1\fs22 2}In the course of the Festival at the close of the Harvest the disciples had all met together,{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 2}when suddenly there came from the heavens a noise like a strong wind rushing by; it filled the whole house in which they were sitting.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 3}Then there appeared tongues of what seemed to be flame, separating, so that one settled on each of them;{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 4}and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and began to speak in different languages as the Spirit prompted their utterances.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi360 
{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 5}Now there were then staying in Jerusalem religious Jews from every country in the world;{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 6}and, when this sound was heard, numbers of people collected, in the greatest excitement, because each of them heard the disciples speaking in his own language.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 7}They were utterly amazed, and kept asking in astonishment, \uc1\u8220*What! Are not all these people who are speaking Galileans?{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 8}Then how is it that we each of us hear them in our own language?{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 9}Some of us are Parthians, some Medes, some Elamites; and some of us live in Mesopotamia, in Judea and Cappadocia, in Pontus and Roman Asia,{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 10}in Phrygia and Pamphylia, in Egypt and the districts of Libya adjoining Cyrene; some of us are visitors from Rome,{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 11}either Jews by birth or converts, and some are Cretans and Arabians \uc1\u8211* yet we all alike hear them speaking in our own languages of the great things that God has done.\uc1\u8221*{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 12}They were all utterly amazed and bewildered.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi360 
\uc1\u8220*What does it mean?\uc1\u8221* they asked one another.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 13}But there were some who said with a sneer, \uc1\u8220*They have had too much new wine.\uc1\u8221*
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi360 
{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 14}Then Peter, surrounded by the eleven other apostles, stood up, and, raising his voice, addressed the crowd. \uc1\u8220*People of Judea,\uc1\u8221* he began, \uc1\u8220*and all you who are staying in Jerusalem, let me tell you what this means. Mark well my words.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 15}These people are not drunk, as you suppose; for it is only now nine in the morning!

{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 22}People of Israel, listen to what I am saying.

{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 26}Therefore my heart was cheered, and my tongue told its delight;

{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 29}Friends, I can speak to you the more confidently about the patriarch David, because he is dead and buried, and his tomb is here among us to this very day.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 30}David, then, prophet as he was, knowing that God had solemnly sworn to him to set one of his descendants on his throne, looked into the future,{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 31}and referred to the resurrection of the Christ when he said that he had not been abandoned to Hades, nor had his body undergone corruption.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 32}It was this Jesus, whom God raised to life; and of that we are ourselves all witnesses.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 33}And now that he has been exalted to the right hand of God, and has received from the Father the promised gift of the Holy Spirit, he has begun to pour out that gift, as you yourselves now see and hear.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 34}It was not David who went up into heaven; for he himself says \uc1\u8211*

{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 36}So let the whole nation of Israel know beyond all doubt, that God has made him both Lord and Christ \uc1\u8211* this Jesus whom you crucified.\uc1\u8221*
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi360 
{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 37}When the people heard this, they were conscience-smitten, and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, \uc1\u8220*Friends, what can we do?\uc1\u8221*
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi360 
{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 38}\uc1\u8220*Repent,\uc1\u8221* answered Peter, \uc1\u8220*and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins; and then you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 39}For the promise is for you and for your children, and also for all those now far away, who may be called by the Lord our God.\uc1\u8221*
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi360 
{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 40}Peter spoke to them for a long time using many other arguments and pleaded with them \uc1\u8211* \uc1\u8220*Save yourselves from the perverse spirit of this age.\uc1\u8221*{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 41}So those who accepted his teaching were baptized, and about three thousand people joined the disciples on that day alone.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 42}They devoted themselves to the teaching of the apostles and to the Common life of the church, to the breaking of the bread and to the Prayers.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi360 
{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 43}A deep impression was made on everyone, and many wonders and signs were done at the hands of the apostles.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 44}All who became believers in Christ held everything for the common use;{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 45}they sold their property and their goods, and shared the proceeds among them all, according to their individual needs.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 46}Every day they devoted themselves to meeting together in the Temple Courts, and to the breaking of bread at their homes, while they partook of their food in simple-hearted gladness, praising God, and winning the goodwill of all the people.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 47}And the Lord daily added to their company those who were in the path of salvation.

{\pard

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi360 
{\cf1\f1\fs22 3}One day, as Peter and John were going up into the Temple Courts for the three o\uc1\u8217*clock Prayers, {\super\f1\cf2\fs24 2}a man, who had been lame from his birth, was being carried by. This man used to be set down every day at the gate of the Temple called \uc1\u8216*the Beautiful Gate,\uc1\u8217* to beg of those who went in.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 3}Seeing Peter and John on the point of entering, he asked them to give him something.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 4}Peter fixed his eyes on him, and so did John, and then Peter said, \uc1\u8220*Look at us.\uc1\u8221*
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi360 
{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 5}The man was all attention, expecting to get something from them;{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 6}but Peter added, \uc1\u8220*I have no gold or silver, but I give you what I have. In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, get up and walk.\uc1\u8221*{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 7}Grasping the lame man by the right hand, Peter lifted him up. Instantly the man\uc1\u8217*s feet and ankles became strong,{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 8}and, leaping up, he stood and began to walk about, and then went with them into the Temple Courts, walking, and leaping, and praising God.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 9}All the people saw him walking about and praising God;{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 10}and, when they recognized him as the man who used to sit begging at the Beautiful Gate of the Temple, they were utterly astonished and amazed at what had happened to him.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 11}While the man still clung to Peter and John, the people all quickly gathered around them in the Colonnade named after Solomon, in the greatest astonishment.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi360 
{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 12}On seeing this, Peter said to the people, \uc1\u8220*People of Israel, why are you surprised at this? And why do you stare at us, as though we, by any power or piety of our own, had enabled this man to walk?{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 13}The God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the God of our ancestors, has done honor to his servant Jesus \uc1\u8211* him whom you gave up and disowned before Pilate, when he had decided to set him free.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 14}You, I say, disowned the holy and righteous one, and asked for the release of a murderer!{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 15}The guide to life you put to death! But God raised him from the dead \uc1\u8211* and of that we are ourselves witnesses.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 16}And it is by faith in the name of Jesus, that this man, whom you all see and know, has \uc1\u8211* by his name \uc1\u8211* been made strong. Yes, it is the faith inspired by Jesus that has made this complete cure of the man, before the eyes of you all.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 17}And yet, my friends, I know that you acted as you did from ignorance, and your rulers also.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 18}But it was in this way that God fulfilled all that he had long ago foretold, as to the sufferings of his Christ, by the lips of all the prophets.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 19}Therefore, repent and turn so that your sins may be wiped away; so that happier times may come from the Lord himself,{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 20}and so that he may send you, in Jesus, your long-appointed Christ.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 21}But heaven must be his home, until the days of the Universal Restoration, of which God has spoken by the lips of his holy prophets from the very first.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 22}Moses himself said \uc1\u8211*

{\pard
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi-2440\li2800
\uc1\u8216*The Lord your God will raise up from among yourselves a prophet, as he raised me. To him you will listen whenever he speaks to you.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 23}And it will be that should anyone among the people not listen to that prophet, he will be utterly destroyed.\uc1\u8217*

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi0 
{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 24}Yes, and all the prophets from Samuel onwards, and all their successors who had a message to deliver, told of these days.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 25}You yourselves are the heirs of the prophets, and heirs, too, of the covenant which God made with your ancestors, when he said to Abraham \uc1\u8211*

{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 8}Then, Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said, \uc1\u8220*Leaders of the people and elders,{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 9}since we are on our trial today for a kind act done to a helpless man, and are asked in what way the man here before you has been cured,{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 10}let me tell you all and all the people of Israel, that it is by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified and whom God raised from the dead \uc1\u8211* it is, I say, by his name that this man stands here before you lame no longer.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 11}Jesus is \uc1\u8216*the stone which, scorned by you the builders, has yet become the corner stone.\uc1\u8217*{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 12}And salvation is in him alone; for there is no other name in the whole world, given to people, to which we must look for our salvation.\uc1\u8221*

{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 13}When the Council saw how boldly Peter and John spoke, and found that they were uneducated men of humble station, they were surprised, and realized that they had been companions of Jesus.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 14}But, when they looked at the man who had been healed, standing there with them, they had nothing to say.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 15}So they ordered them out of court, and then began consulting together.

God, who manifests himself in the glory, appeared to our ancestor Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia, and before he settled in Haran, and said to him \uc1\u8211*{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 3}\uc1\u8216*Leave your country and your people, and come into the country that I will show you.\uc1\u8217*{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 4}And so Abraham left the country of the Chaldaeans and settled in Haran; and from there, after his father\uc1\u8217*s death, God caused him to migrate into this country, in which you are now living.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 5}God did not at that time give him any part of it, not even a foot of ground. But he promised to give him possession of it and his descendants after him, though at that time he had no child.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 6}God\uc1\u8217*s words were these \uc1\u8211* \uc1\u8216*Abraham\uc1\u8217*s descendants will live in a foreign country, where they will be enslaved and ill-treated for four hundred years.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 7}But I myself will judge the nation, to which they will be enslaved,\uc1\u8217* God said, \uc1\u8216*and after that they will leave the country and worship me in this place.\uc1\u8217*{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 8}Then God made with Abraham the covenant of circumcision; and under it Abraham became the father of Isaac, and circumcised him when he was eight days old; and Isaac became the father of Jacob; and Jacob of the Twelve Patriarchs.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 9}The Patriarchs, out of jealousy, sold Joseph into slavery in Egypt; but God was with him,{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 10}and delivered him out of all his troubles, and enabled him to win favor and show wisdom before Pharaoh, king of Egypt, who appointed him Governor of Egypt and of his whole household.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 11}Then a famine spread over the whole of Egypt and Canaan, causing great distress, and our ancestors could find no food.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 12}Hearing, however, that there was corn in Egypt, Jacob sent our ancestors there on their first visit.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 13}In the course of their second visit, Joseph revealed himself to his brothers, and his family became known to Pharaoh.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 14}Then Joseph sent an urgent invitation to his father Jacob and to his relatives, seventy-five persons in all;{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 15}and so Jacob went down into Egypt. There he died, and our ancestors also,{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 16}and their bodies were removed to Shechem, and laid in the tomb which Abraham had bought for a sum of money from the sons of Hamor in Shechem.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 17}As the time drew near for the fulfillment of the promise which God had made to Abraham, the people increased largely in numbers in Egypt,{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 18}until a new king, who knew nothing of Joseph, came to the throne.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 19}This king acted deceitfully towards our people and ill-treated our ancestors, making them abandon their own infants, so that they should not be reared.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 20}It was just at this time that Moses was born. He was an exceedingly beautiful child, and for three months was brought up in his own father\uc1\u8217*s house;{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 21}and, when he was abandoned, the daughter of Pharaoh found him and brought him up as her own son.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 22}So Moses was educated in all the learning of the Egyptians, and proved his ability both by his words and actions.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 23}When he was in his fortieth year, he resolved to visit his fellow Israelites;{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 24}and, seeing an Israelite ill-treated, he defended him, and avenged the man, who was being wronged, by striking down the Egyptian.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 25}He thought his own people would understand that God was using him to save them; but they failed to do so.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 26}The next day he again appeared on the scene, when some of them were fighting, and tried to make peace between them. \uc1\u8216*Men,\uc1\u8217* he said, \uc1\u8216*you are brothers; how is it that you are ill-treating one another?\uc1\u8217*{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 27}But the man who was ill-treating his fellow workman pushed Moses aside saying \uc1\u8211* \uc1\u8216*Who made you a ruler and judge over us?{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 28}Do you mean to make away with me as you did yesterday with that Egyptian?\uc1\u8217*{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 29}At these words Moses took to flight, and became an exile in Midian; and there he had two sons born to him.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 30}Forty years had passed when there appeared to him, in the desert of Mount Sinai, an angel in a flame of fire in a bush.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 31}When Moses saw it, he was astonished at the vision; but on his going nearer to look at it more closely, the voice of the Lord was heard to say \uc1\u8211*{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 32}\uc1\u8216*I am the God of your ancestors, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.\uc1\u8217* Moses trembled, and did not dare to look.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 33}Then the Lord said to him \uc1\u8211* \uc1\u8216*Take your sandals off your feet, for the spot where you are standing is holy ground.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 34}I have seen the oppression of my people who are in Egypt, and heard their groans, and I have come down to deliver them.

{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 22}It was then decided by the apostles and the elders, with the assent of the whole church, to choose some of their number, and send them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas.

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi0 
{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 30}So the bearers of this letter were sent on their way, and went down to Antioch.

{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 35}Paul and Barnabas, however, remained in Antioch, where they taught and, with the help of many others, told the good news of the Lord\uc1\u8217*s message.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 36}Some time after this, Paul said to Barnabas, \uc1\u8220*Let us go back and visit the Lord\uc1\u8217*s followers in every town in which we have told the Lord\uc1\u8217*s message, and see how they are prospering.\uc1\u8221*{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 37}Barnabas wished to take with them John, whose other name was Mark;{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 38}but Paul felt that they ought not to take with them the man who had deserted them in Pamphylia, and had not gone on with them to their work.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 39}This caused such unpleasant feeling between them that they parted ways, Barnabas taking Mark and sailing for Cyprus,{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 40}while Paul chose Silas for his companion and, after he had been committed by the followers to the gracious care of the Lord,{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 41}started on his journey and went through Syria and Cilicia, strengthening the churches in the faith.

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi360 
{\cf1\f1\fs22 16}Among other places Paul went to Derbe and Lystra.

{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 5}So the churches grew stronger in the faith, and increased in numbers from day to day.

{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 6}They next went through the Phrygian district of Galatia, but were restrained by the Holy Spirit from delivering the message in Roman Asia.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 7}When they reached the borders of Mysia, they attempted to go into Bithynia, but the Spirit of Jesus did not permit them.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 8}Passing through Mysia, they went down to Troas;{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 9}and there one night Paul saw a vision.

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi360 
{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 16}While Paul was waiting for them at Athens, his heart was stirred at seeing the whole city full of idols.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 17}So he argued in the synagogue with the Jews and with those who joined in their worship, as well as daily in the public Square with those who happened to be there.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 18}Among others, some Epicurean and Stoic Philosophers joined issue with him.

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi360 
\uc1\u8220*May we hear,\uc1\u8221* they asked, \uc1\u8220*what new teaching this is which you are giving?{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 20}For you are bringing some strange things to our notice, and we should like to know what they mean.\uc1\u8221*{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 21}(All Athenians and the foreigners staying in the city found no time for anything else but telling, or listening to, the last new thing.)

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi360 
{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 22}So Paul took his stand in the middle of the Court, and said \uc1\u8211* \uc1\u8220*People of Athens, on every hand I see signs of your being very devout.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 23}For as I was going about, looking at your sacred shrines, I came upon an altar with this inscription \uc1\u8211* \uc1\u8216*To an Unknown God.\uc1\u8217* What, therefore, you worship in ignorance, that I am now proclaiming to you.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 24}The God who made the world and all things that are in it \uc1\u8211* he, Lord as he is of heaven and earth, does not live in temples made by hands,{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 25}neither do human hands minister to his wants, as though he needed anything, since he himself gives, to all, life, and breath, and all things.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 26}He made all races of the earth\uc1\u8217*s surface \uc1\u8211* fixing a time for their rise and fall, and the limits of their settlements \uc1\u8211*{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 27}That they might search for God, if by any means they might feel their way to him and find him.

{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 29}Therefore, as the offspring of God, we must not think that the Deity has any resemblance to anything made of gold, or silver, or stone \uc1\u8211* a work of human art and imagination.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 30}True, God looked with indulgence on the days of people\uc1\u8217*s ignorance, but now he is announcing to everyone everywhere the need for repentance,{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 31}because he has fixed a day on which he intends to judge the world with justice, by a man whom he has appointed \uc1\u8211* and of this he has given all people a pledge by raising this man from the dead.\uc1\u8221*
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi360 
{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 32}On hearing of a resurrection of the dead, some began jeering, but others said that they wanted to hear what he had to say about that another time.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 33}And so Paul left the Court.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 34}There were, however, some people who joined him, and became believers in Christ.

\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi360 
{\cf1\f1\fs22 18}On leaving Athens, Paul next went to Corinth.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 2}There he met a Jew of the name of Aquila, from Pontus, who, with his wife Priscilla, had lately come from Italy, in consequence of the order which had been issued by the Emperor Claudius for all Jews to leave Rome. Paul paid them a visit,{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 3}and, since their trade was the same as his, he stayed and worked with them \uc1\u8211* their trade was tent-making.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 4}Every Sabbath Paul gave addresses in the synagogue, trying to convince both Jews and Greeks.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi360 
{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 5}But, when Silas and Timothy had come down from Macedonia, Paul devoted himself entirely to delivering the message, earnestly maintaining before the Jews that Jesus was the Christ.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 6}However, as they set themselves against him and became abusive, Paul shook his clothes in protest and said to them, \uc1\u8220*Your blood be on your own heads.

\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi360 
{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 7}So he left, and went to the house of a certain Titius Justus, who had been accustomed to join in the worship of God, and whose house was next door to the synagogue.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 8}Crispus, the synagogue leader, came to believe in the Lord, and so did all his household; and many of the Corinthians, as they listened to Paul, became believers in Christ and were baptized.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 9}One night the Lord said to Paul, in a vision, \uc1\u8220*Have no fear, but continue to speak, and refuse to be silenced;{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 10}for I am with you, and no one will do you harm, for I have many people in this city.\uc1\u8221*{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 11}So he settled there for a year and a half, and taught God\uc1\u8217*s message among the people.

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi360 
{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 12}While Gallio was governor of Greece, some of the Jewish leaders made a combined attack on Paul, and brought him before the Governor\uc1\u8217*s Bench,{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 13}charging him with persuading people to worship God in a way forbidden by the Law.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 14}Just as Paul was on the point of speaking, Gallio said to them, \uc1\u8220*If this were a case of misdemeanor or some serious crime, there would be some reason for my listening patiently to you;{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 15}but, since it is a dispute about words, and names, and your own Law, you must see to it yourselves.

{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 16}Saying this, he drove them back from the Bench.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 17}Then they all set on Sosthenes, the synagogue leader, and beat him in front of the Bench, but Gallio did not trouble himself about any of these things.

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi360 
{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 18}Paul remained there some time after this, and then took leave of the followers, and sailed to Syria with Priscilla and Aquila, but not before his head had been shaved at Cenchreae, because he was under a vow.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 19}They put into Ephesus, and there Paul, leaving his companions, went into the synagogue and addressed the Jews.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 20}When they asked him to prolong his stay, he declined, saying however,{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 21}as he took his leave, \uc1\u8220*I will come back again to you, please God,\uc1\u8221* and then set sail from Ephesus.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 22}On reaching Caesarea, he went up to Jerusalem and exchanged greetings with the church, and then went down to Antioch.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 23}After making some stay in Antioch, he set out on a tour through the Phrygian district of Galatia, strengthening the faith of all the disciples as he went.

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi360 
{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 24}Meanwhile there had come to Ephesus an Alexandrian Jew, named Apollos, an eloquent man, who was well-versed in the scriptures.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 25}He had been well-instructed in the Way of the Lord, and with burning zeal he spoke of, and taught carefully, the facts about Jesus, though he knew of no baptism but John\uc1\u8217*s.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 26}This man began to speak out fearlessly in the synagogue; and when Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they took him home and explained the Way of God to him more carefully still.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 27}When he wanted to cross to Greece, the followers furthered his plans, and wrote to the disciples there to welcome him. On his arrival he proved of great assistance to those who had, through the loving kindness of God, become believers in Christ,{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 28}for he vigorously confuted the Jews, publicly proving by the scriptures that Jesus was the Christ.

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi360 
{\cf1\f1\fs22 19}While Apollos was at Corinth, Paul passed through the inland districts of Roman Asia, and went to Ephesus. There he found some disciples, of whom he asked,{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 2}\uc1\u8220*Did you, when you became believers in Christ, receive the Holy Spirit?\uc1\u8221*

{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 5}On hearing this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus,{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 6}and, after Paul had placed his hands on them, the Holy Spirit descended on them, and they began to speak in other languages and to preach.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 7}There were about twelve of them in all.

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi360 
{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 8}Paul went to the synagogue there, and for three months spoke out fearlessly, giving addresses and trying to convince his hearers, about the kingdom of God.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 9}Some of them, however, hardened their hearts and refused to believe, denouncing the Way before the people. So Paul left them and withdrew his disciples, and gave daily addresses in the lecture-hall of Tyrannus.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 10}This went on for two years, so that all who lived in Roman Asia, Jews and Greeks alike, heard the Lord\uc1\u8217*s message.

{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 11}God did miracles of no ordinary kind by Paul\uc1\u8217*s hands;{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 12}so that people would carry home to the sick handkerchiefs or aprons that had touched his body, and their diseases would leave them and the wicked spirits go out of them.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 13}An attempt was made by some itinerant Jews, who were exorcists, to use the name of the Lord Jesus over those who had wicked spirits in them.

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi360 
{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 16}Then the man, in whom this wicked spirit was, sprang on them, mastered both of them, and so completely overpowered them, that they fled out of the house, stripped of their clothes, and wounded.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 17}This incident came to the knowledge of all the Jews and Greeks living at Ephesus; they were all awe-struck, and the name of the Lord Jesus was held in the highest honor.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 18}Many, too, of those who had become believers in Christ came with a full confession of their practices;{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 19}while a number of people, who had practiced magic, collected their books and burnt them publicly; and on reckoning up the price of these, they found it amounted to fifty thousand silver coins.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 20}So irresistibly did the Lord\uc1\u8217*s message spread and prevail.

It is for this hope, your Majesty, that I am accused \uc1\u8211* and by Jews themselves!{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 8}Why do you all hold it incredible that God should raise the dead?{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 9}I myself, it is true, once thought it my duty to oppose in every way the name of Jesus of Nazareth;{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 10}and I actually did so at Jerusalem. Acting on the authority of the chief priests, I myself threw many of the people of Christ into prison, and, when it was proposed to put them to death, I gave my vote for it.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 11}Time after time, in every synagogue, I tried by punishments to force them to blaspheme. So frantic was I against them, that I pursued them even to towns beyond our borders.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 12}It was while I was traveling to Damascus on an errand of this kind, entrusted with full powers by the chief priests,{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 13}that at midday, your Majesty, I saw right in my path, coming from the heavens, a light brighter than the glare of the sun, which shone all around me and those traveling with me.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 14}We all fell to the ground, and then I heard a voice saying to me in Hebrew \uc1\u8211* \uc1\u8216*Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me? By kicking against the goad you are punishing yourself.\uc1\u8217*{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 15}\uc1\u8216*Who are you, Lord?\uc1\u8217* I asked. And the Lord said, \uc1\u8216*I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting;{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 16}but get up and stand upright; for I have appeared to you in order to appoint you a servant and a witness of those revelations of me which you have already had, and of those in which I will yet appear to you,{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 17}since I am choosing you out from your own people and from the Gentiles, to whom I now send you,{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 18}to open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan to God; so that they may receive pardon for their sins, and a place among those who have become God\uc1\u8217*s people, by faith in me.\uc1\u8217*{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 19}After that, King Agrippa, I did not fail to obey the heavenly vision;{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 20}on the contrary, first to those at Damascus and Jerusalem, and then through the whole of Judea, and to the Gentiles as well, I began to preach repentance and conversion to God, and a life befitting that repentance.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 21}This is why some men seized me in the Temple, and made attempts on my life.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 22}However I have received help from God to this very day, and so stand here, and bear my testimony to high and low alike \uc1\u8211* without adding a word to what the prophets, as well as Moses, declared should happen \uc1\u8211*{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 23}That the Christ must suffer, and that, by rising from the dead, he was destined to be the first to bring news of light, not only to our nation, but also to the Gentiles.\uc1\u8221*

But, afraid of being driven on to the Syrtis Sands, they lowered the yard, and then drifted.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 18}So violently were we tossed about by the storm, that the next day they began throwing the cargo overboard,{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 19}and, on the following day, threw out the ship\uc1\u8217*s tackle with their own hands.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 20}As neither sun nor stars were visible for several days, and, as the gale still continued severe, all hope of our being saved was at last abandoned.

After waiting a little, they took soundings again, and found fifteen fathoms.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 29}Then, as they were afraid of our being driven on some rocky coast, they let go four anchors from the stern, and longed for daylight.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 30}The sailors wanted to leave the ship, and had lowered the boat, on pretense of running out anchors from the bows,{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 31}when Paul said to the Roman officer and his men, \uc1\u8220*Unless the sailors remain on board, you cannot be saved.\uc1\u8221*{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 32}So the soldiers cut the ropes which held the boat, and let her drift away.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 33}In the interval before daybreak Paul kept urging them all to take something to eat.

The bows stuck fast and could not be moved, while the stern began breaking up under the strain.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 42}The advice of the soldiers was that the prisoners should be killed, so that none of them could swim away and make their escape.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 43}But the Roman officer, anxious to save Paul, prevented their carrying out their intention, and ordered that those who could swim should be the first to jump into the sea and try to reach the shore;{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 44}and that the rest should follow, some on planks, and others on different pieces of the ship. In these various ways everyone managed to get safely ashore.

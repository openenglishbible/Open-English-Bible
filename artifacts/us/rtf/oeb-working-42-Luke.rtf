Many attempts have been already made to draw up an account of those events which have reached their conclusion among us,{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 2}just as they were reported to us by those who from the beginning were eye-witnesses, and afterward became bearers of the message.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 3}And, therefore, I also, since I have investigated all these events with great care from their very beginning, have resolved to write a connected history of them for you,{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 4}in order that you may be able to satisfy yourself of the accuracy of the story which you have heard from the lips of others.

{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 5}In the reign of Herod, king of Judea, there was a priest named Zechariah, who belonged to the division called after Abijah. His wife, whose name was Elizabeth, was also a descendant of Aaron.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 6}They were both righteous people, who lived blameless lives, guiding their steps by all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 7}But they had no child, Elizabeth being barren; and both of them were advanced in years.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi360 
{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 8}One day, when Zechariah was officiating as priest before God, during the turn of his division,{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 9}it fell to him by lot, in accordance with the practice among the priests, to go into the Temple of the Lord and burn incense;{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 10}and, as it was the Hour of Incense, the people were all praying outside.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 11}And an angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing on the right of the Altar of Incense.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 12}Zechariah was startled at the sight and was awe-struck.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 13}But the angel said to him, \uc1\u8220*Do not be afraid, Zechariah; your prayer has been heard, and your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, whom you will call by the name John.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 14}He will be to you a joy and a delight; and many will rejoice over his birth.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 15}For he will be great in the sight of the Lord; he will not drink any wine or strong drink, and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit from the very hour of his birth,{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 16}and will reconcile many of the Israelites to the Lord their God.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 17}He will go before him in the spirit and with the power of Elijah, to reconcile fathers to their children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the righteous, and so make ready for the Lord a people prepared for him.\uc1\u8221*

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi360 
{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 18}\uc1\u8220*How can I be sure of this?\uc1\u8221* Zechariah asked the angel. \uc1\u8220*For I am an old man and my wife is advanced in years.\uc1\u8221*

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi360 
{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 19}\uc1\u8220*I am Gabriel,\uc1\u8221* the angel answered, \uc1\u8220*who stand in the presence of God, and I have been sent to speak to you and to bring you this good news.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 20}And now you will be silent and unable to speak until the day when this takes place, because you did not believe what I said, though my words will be fulfilled in due course.\uc1\u8221*

{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 21}Meanwhile the people were watching for Zechariah, wondering at his remaining so long in the Temple.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 22}When he came out, he was unable to speak to them, and they perceived that he had seen a vision there. But Zechariah kept making signs to them, and remained dumb.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 23}And, as soon as his term of service was finished, he returned home.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 24}After this his wife, Elizabeth, became pregnant and lived in seclusion for five months.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 25}\uc1\u8220*The Lord has done this for me,\uc1\u8221* she said, \uc1\u8220*he has shown me kindness and taken away the public disgrace of childlessness under which I have been living.\uc1\u8221*

{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 26}Six months later the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a town in Galilee called Nazareth,{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 27}to a maiden there who was engaged to a man named Joseph, a descendant of David. Her name was Mary.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 28}Gabriel came into her presence and greeted her, saying, \uc1\u8220*You have been shown great favor \uc1\u8211* the Lord is with you.\uc1\u8221*
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi360 
{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 29}Mary was much disturbed at his words, and was wondering to herself what such a greeting could mean,{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 30}when the angel spoke again, \uc1\u8220*Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 31}And now, you will conceive and give birth to a son, and you will give him the name Jesus.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 32}The child will be great and will be called \uc1\u8216*Son of the Most High,\uc1\u8217* and the Lord God will give him the throne of his ancestor David,{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 33}and he will reign over the descendants of Jacob for ever; And to his kingdom there will be no end.\uc1\u8221*

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi360 
{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 34}\uc1\u8220*How can this be?\uc1\u8221* Mary asked the angel. \uc1\u8220*For I have no husband.\uc1\u8221*

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi360 
{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 35}\uc1\u8220*The Holy Spirit will descend on you,\uc1\u8221* answered the angel, \uc1\u8220*and the Power of the Most High will overshadow you; and therefore the child will be called \uc1\u8216*holy,\uc1\u8217* and \uc1\u8216*Son of God.\uc1\u8217*{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 36}And Elizabeth, your cousin, is herself also expecting a son in her old age; and it is now the sixth month with her, though she is called barren;{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 37}for no promise from God will fail to be fulfilled.\uc1\u8221*
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi360 
{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 38}\uc1\u8220*I am the servant of the Lord,\uc1\u8221* exclaimed Mary. \uc1\u8220*Let it be with me as you have said.\uc1\u8221* Then the angel left her.
\par}

{\pard\sl280\slmult1\fs24\fi360 
{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 39}Soon after this Mary set out, and made her way quickly into the hill-country, to a town in Judah;{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 40}and there she went into Zechariah\uc1\u8217*s house and greeted Elizabeth.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 41}When Elizabeth heard Mary\uc1\u8217*s greeting, the child moved within her, and Elizabeth herself was filled with the Holy Spirit,{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 42}and cried aloud, \uc1\u8220*Blessed are you among women, and blessed is your unborn child!{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 43}But how have I this honor, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 44}For, as soon as your greeting reached my ears, the child moved within me with delight!{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 45}Happy indeed is she who believed that the promise which she received from the Lord would be fulfilled.\uc1\u8221*

{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 13}It happened that very day that two of the disciples were going to a village called Emmaus, which was about seven miles from Jerusalem,{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 14}talking together, as they went, about all that had just taken place.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 15}While they were talking about these things and discussing them, Jesus himself came up and went on their way with them;{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 16}but their eyes were blinded so that they could not recognize him.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 17}\uc1\u8220*What is this that you are saying to each other as you walk along?\uc1\u8221* Jesus asked. They stopped, with sad looks on their faces,{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 18}and then one of them, whose name was Cleopas, said to Jesus, \uc1\u8220*Are you staying by yourself at Jerusalem, that you have not heard of the things that have happened there within the last few days?\uc1\u8221*

They went to the tomb at daybreak{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 23}And, not finding the body of Jesus there, came and told us that they had seen a vision of angels who told them that he was alive.{\super\f1\cf2\fs24 24}So some of our number went to the tomb and found everything just as the women had said, but they did not see Jesus.\uc1\u8221*

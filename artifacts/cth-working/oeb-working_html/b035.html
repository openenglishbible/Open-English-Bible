<span class="verse" rel="v035001002" id="001002" >2</span>
 How long,  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, have I cried out <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and without you hearing me! <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; I cry to you, ‘Violence!’ <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but you do not help. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v035001003" id="001003" >3</span>
 Why do you make me look upon wickedness <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and behold trouble? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Destruction and violence are before my eyes, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and fighting and quarrelling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v035001004" id="001004" >4</span>
 Therefore the law is weak, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and justice is never rendered; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; for the wicked surround the righteous, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; so that justice is perverted. </p><h6>(The Lord)</h6><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v035001005" id="001005" >5</span>
 Look at the nations, look well, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; be shocked and amazed. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; For I am about to do a work in your days; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you will not believe it when it is told. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v035001006" id="001006" >6</span>
 For I am about to raise up the Chaldeans, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a nation grim and quick of action <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; who sweep over the whole breadth of the earth <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to seize dwellings not their own. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v035001007" id="001007" >7</span>
 They bring fear and terror. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They write their own rules. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v035001008" id="001008" >8</span>
 Their horses are swifter than leopards, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; quicker than wolves hunting at dusk. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; From afar they come swooping down, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; like an eagle attacking its prey. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v035001009" id="001009" >9</span>
 They all come to do violence, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a horde like a desert wind, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; they gather up captives like sand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v035001010" id="001010" >10</span>
 At kings they scoff, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and princes are sport to them. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; They laugh at every fortress, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and heap up earth to take it. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v035001011" id="001011" >11</span>
 Then they sweep on like the wind, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Their strength is their god. </p><h6>(Habbakuk)</h6><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v035001012" id="001012" >12</span>
 Are you not eternal,  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; my holy one, who does not die? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="nd"> Lord </span>  you have appointed them to execute judgment, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; my rock, you have established them to punish. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v035001013" id="001013" >13</span>
 Your eyes are too pure to look at evil, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you cannot condone iniquity. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; So why do you regard the treacherous in silence, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; while the wicked swallows the upright? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v035001014" id="001014" >14</span>
 You have made people like the fish of the sea, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; like reptiles that have no ruler. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v035001015" id="001015" >15</span>
 The wicked sweep them all into their nets, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and gather them into their drag-nets, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and rejoice and celebrate. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v035001016" id="001016" >16</span>
 Therefore they sacrifice to their net, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and burn offerings to their drag-net; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; for by their nets are their portions generous, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and their food is rich. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v035001017" id="001017" >17</span>
 Will they empty their nets continually, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; slaughter nations unpityingly? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="chapter" id="002001">2</span> I will take my stand on my watch-tower, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and station myself on a turret. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; I will watch to see what the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  will say to me, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; what answer he will make to my complaint. </p><h6>(The Lord)</h6><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v035002002" id="002002" >2</span>
 Then the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  answered me and said: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Inscribe the vision plainly on tablets, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; so that even someone running by could read it. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v035002003" id="002003" >3</span>
 Though the vision waits for the time set, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it hastens to fulfilment and will not fail; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Though it linger long, wait for it. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For it surely will come and will not be delayed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v035002004" id="002004" >4</span>
 The strength of the proud fails, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but the upright lives by their faithfulness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v035002005" id="002005" >5</span>
 Wealth is treacherous, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the arrogant never have enough. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; They make their desire as wide as Sheol, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; are like death, unsatisfied, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; For they gather to themselves all the nations, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bring together to themselves all peoples. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v035002006" id="002006" >6</span>
 Shouldn’t everyone mock them? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sing a taunt-song against them, and say: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Woe to the person who amasses what is not theirs, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and loads them self down with goods taken in pledge! <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v035002007" id="002007" >7</span>
 Won’t your creditors suddenly rise, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and those who will overthrow you awake, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and you become their prey? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v035002008" id="002008" >8</span>
 For as you have plundered many peoples, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the survivors will prey upon you. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; You have shed blood and committed violence <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to the earth, peoples and their cities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v035002009" id="002009" >9</span>
 Woe to you who seeks unjust gain for your dynasty, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; who sets your nest on high to be safe from the reach of misfortune! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v035002010" id="002010" >10</span>
 You have planned only shame for your dynasty. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; You have destroyed many peoples, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and brought guilt upon yourself; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v035002011" id="002011" >11</span>
 the stone will cry out from the wall, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and the beam from the timber will answer it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v035002012" id="002012" >12</span>
 Woe to the person who builds a city by bloodshed, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and founds a town by crime <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v035002013" id="002013" >13</span>
 while the peoples toil for what fires will consume, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and the nations weary themselves for nothing! <br /><br /> This the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  of hosts has said, 
<span class="verse" rel="v035002014" id="002014" >14</span>
 and the earth will be as full of the knowledge of the glory of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  as the seas are full of water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v035002015" id="002015" >15</span>
 Woe to him who in fury gives drink to his neighbor <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to make him drunk, and see him naked. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v035002016" id="002016" >16</span>
 You are filled with shame, not glory; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; drink yourself and be uncovered. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; The cup from the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span> ’s hand <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; will pass in turn to you, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and shame will cover your glory! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v035002017" id="002017" >17</span>
 For the violence done to Lebanon will overwhelm you, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the destruction of animals will terrify you, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; because you shed people’s blood on the earth, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; destroyed people and their cities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v035002018" id="002018" >18</span>
 What use is an idol? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; A human made it, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a metal image. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; It cannot speak, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it cannot teach truth, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Why does its maker trust it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v035002019" id="002019" >19</span>
 Woe to the person who says to a block, awake! <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to a dumb stone, arise! <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; What can it teach? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; It may be set with gold and silver, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but there is no breath at all within it. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v035002020" id="002020" >20</span>
 The  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  is in his holy temple. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let all the earth be silent before him! </p><h6>Habakkuk’s psalm</h6><p><span class="chapter" id="003001">3</span> A prayer of Habakkuk the prophet, according to the Shigionoth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v035003002" id="003002" >2</span>
 I have heard,  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, of your fame, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have seen,  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, your work; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; through the years you have make yourself known, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in wrath you remember mercy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v035003003" id="003003" >3</span>
 God comes from Teman, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and the Holy One from the mountain-land of Paran.   Selah <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; His glory covers the heavens, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and his splendour fills the earth. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v035003004" id="003004" >4</span>
 Before him it is like the light, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rays he has at his side, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; where his power is hidden. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v035003005" id="003005" >5</span>
 Before him pestilence stalks, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; after him plague follows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v035003006" id="003006" >6</span>
 He stands, and the earth trembles, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he looks, and the nations melt away, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; and the mountains of old are scattered, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the everlasting hills bow down. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; These are his ways from of old. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v035003007" id="003007" >7</span>
 The tents of Cushan are afraid, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the curtains of Midian tremble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v035003008" id="003008" >8</span>
 Is your wrath,  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, with the rivers? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is your anger against the streams? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or your rage against the sea? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Is that why you ride on your war-steeds? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why you mount your chariots of victory? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v035003009" id="003009" >9</span>
 Why you bare your bow? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why you fill your quiver with shafts? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; You split the earth with torrents. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v035003010" id="003010" >10</span>
 The mountains see you and writhe. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; The tempest of waters sweeps by. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The great deep sends forth its voice, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and lifts up its hands. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v035003011" id="003011" >11</span>
 The sun forgets to rise. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The moon stands still in its place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Your arrows go forth to give light. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your glittering spear is as lightning. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v035003012" id="003012" >12</span>
 In rage you stride over the earth. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In wrath you trample the nations. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v035003013" id="003013" >13</span>
 You go forth to save your people. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You go to help your anointed. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; You crush the head of the wicked nation, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; laying him bare from thigh to neck.   Selah <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v035003014" id="003014" >14</span>
 You pierced his head with his spears, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as his champions storm out to scatter us, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as they rejoice to devour the poor secretly. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v035003015" id="003015" >15</span>
 You tread the sea with your horses, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; while the mighty waters roar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v035003016" id="003016" >16</span>
 I hear, and my body trembles, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and at the sound my lips quiver. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; My bones begin to decay, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and my footsteps totter beneath me, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; while I long for the day of distress <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to come upon those who attack us. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v035003017" id="003017" >17</span>
 Though the fig-tree bears no fruit, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and there are no grapes on the vines, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; though the olive harvest fails, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and the fields produce no food, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; though the flock is cut off from the fold, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and there is no herd in the stalls, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v035003018" id="003018" >18</span>
 yet I will exult in the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and rejoice in the God who saves me. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v035003019" id="003019" >19</span>
 The Lord  <span class="nd"> God </span>  is my strength; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he makes my feet as sure as the feet of deer, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and causes me to walk on the heights! <br /><br /> To the music director: Use stringed instruments.

<span class="verse" rel="v028001002" id="001002" >2</span>
<br /><br /> Now Jehovah said to Hosea: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Go marry a wife with whorish instincts  <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; who will bear you children by her whoredom, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; For the land is continually going a-whoring from after Jehovah. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So he went and married Gomer, the daughter of Dibliam. <br /><br /> And when she conceived and bore him a son,  
<span class="verse" rel="v028001004" id="001004" >4</span>
 Jehovah said: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Call his name <<Jezreel,>> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; For yet a little while <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And I will avenge the blood shed at Jezreel upon the house of Jehu, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And I will cause the kingdom of Israel to cease. 
<span class="verse" rel="v028001005" id="001005" >5</span>
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And it shall come to pass in that day, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; That I will break the bow of Israel in the valley of Jezreel. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v028001006" id="001006" >6</span>
 And when she conceived again and bore a daughter, he said to him: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Call her name <<Unpitied,>> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For I will no longer <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Have pity on the house of Israel. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; That I should still spare them. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v028001008" id="001008" >8</span>
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Then she weaned Unpitied; and when she conceived and bore a son, he  said: 
<span class="verse" rel="v028001009" id="001009" >9</span>
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Call his name, <<Not-my-people:>> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; For ye indeed are not my people, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And I indeed am not your God. <br /><br /> Then Hosea said:  <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; I will put away Gomer, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; For she is not my wife,  <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And I will not be her husband; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And on her children I will have no pity, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Since they are children of whoredom, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; For their mother hath become a harlot,  She who conceived them hath behaved shamefully. <br /><br /><span class="chapter" id="03 001">3 </span> But Jehovah said to me: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Still go, love this woman, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Who loves a paramour and is an adulteress, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; As Jehovah loveth the Israelites, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Although they turn to other gods, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And love raisin-cakes. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v02803 002" id="03 002" >2</span>
 So I bought her to me for fifteen pieces of silver and eight bushels of barley and a measure of barley. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v02803 003" id="03 003" >3</span>
 And I said to her: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Many days shalt thou abide for me, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou shall not play the harlot, and thou shalt not be any man’s wife,  <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet, I, on my part will be thine. 
<span class="verse" rel="v02803 004" id="03 004" >4</span>
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; For through many days <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; The Israelites shall abide <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Without king and without prince,  <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Without sacrifice and without pillar, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Without ephod and without teraphim. 
<span class="verse" rel="v02803 005" id="03 005" >5</span>
<br /><br /> Afterward the Israelites shall return, and seek Jehovah their God and David their king. and they shall come trembling to Jehovah and his goodness, at the end of days. 
<span class="verse" rel="v028002002" id="002002" >2</span>
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="chapter" id="002001">2</span> Strive with your mother, strive, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; That she put her acts of whoredom from her sight, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And her adulteries from between her breasts, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Lest I strip her naked, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And set her as she was on the day of her birth, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And make her like the wilderness, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And let her become like a parched land, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And let her die of thirst. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v028002005" id="002005" >5</span>
 For she hath said, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; I will go after my paramour <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Who gave me my bread and my water, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; My wool, my flax, my oil, and my drink. 
<span class="verse" rel="v028002006" id="002006" >6</span>
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore I am going to hedge up her ways with thorns,  <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And build a wall about her,  <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; So that she cannot find her paths.  
<span class="verse" rel="v028002007" id="002007" >7</span>
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And she will pursue her paramours, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; But will not overtake them,  <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And she will seek and not find them. 
<span class="verse" rel="v028002008" id="002008" >8</span>
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; But she herself did not know  <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; That it was I who gave her  <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; The corn, the sweet wine, and the oil. 
<span class="verse" rel="v028002009" id="002009" >9</span>
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore I will take back my corn in its time, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And my sweet wine in its season, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And I will withdraw my wool and my flax, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Given to cover her nakedness; 
<span class="verse" rel="v028002010" id="002010" >10</span>
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And so I will uncover her shame, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And none shall deliver her out of my hand. 
<span class="verse" rel="v028002012" id="002012" >12</span>
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And I will lay waste her vines and her fig-trees, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Of which she bath said, <<These are my rewards <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Which my lovers have given me.>> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And I will make them a thicket, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And the wild beasts shall devour them. 
<span class="verse" rel="v028002011" id="002011" >11</span>
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And I will also cause all her mirth to cease, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Her feasts, her new moon, and her sabbaths. 
<span class="verse" rel="v028002013" id="002013" >13</span>
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And thus will I visit upon her the days of the Baalim, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; In which she made offerings to them, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And decked herself with ear-rings and jewels, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And went after her paramours, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And forgot me, is the oracle of Jehovah. 
<span class="verse" rel="v028002014" id="002014" >14</span>
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore I am going to allure her, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And bring her into the wilderness, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And speak endearingly to her. 
<span class="verse" rel="v028002015" id="002015" >15</span>
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And I will give her from there her vineyards, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And the valley of Achori as a door of hope, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And there she shall respond as in the days of her youth, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; As in the days when she came up from the land of Egypt. 
<span class="verse" rel="v028002016" id="002016" >16</span>
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And it shall be in that day, is the oracle of Jehovah, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; She shall call to her husband, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And shall call no more to the Baalim. 
<span class="verse" rel="v028002017" id="002017" >17</span>
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And I will remove the name of the Baitlim from her mouth, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And they shall no more be mentioned by their names. 
<span class="verse" rel="v028002018" id="002018" >18</span>
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And I will betroth her to me forever, 
<span class="verse" rel="v028002019" id="002019" >19</span>
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Yea, I will betroth hers to me in righteousness, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And in judgment, and in kindness, and in mercy, 
<span class="verse" rel="v028002020" id="002020" >20</span>
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Yea, I will betroth her to me in faithfulness and she shall know  Jehovah! <br />
<span class="verse" rel="v028002021" id="002021" >21</span>
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And it shall come to pass in that day, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; That I will speak, — it is the oracle of Jehovah,— <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; I will speak to the heavens, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And they will speak to the earth. 
<span class="verse" rel="v028002022" id="002022" >22</span>
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And the earth will speak to the grain, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And the new wine and the oil: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And they shall speak to Jezreel, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And I will sow her in the land. 
<span class="verse" rel="v028002023" id="002023" >23</span>
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And I will have pity upon the unpitied, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And I will say to Not-my-people, <<Thou art my people,>> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And they will say, <<Thou art my God.>> 
<span class="verse" rel="v028002018" id="002018" >18</span>
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="chapter" id="002001">2</span> And I will make for them a covenant in that day,   <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; With the wild beasts, and the birds of the heavens and the creeping things of the earth, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And the bow and the sword and war I will completely destroy from out the land,  <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And I will make them lie down in safety. 
<span class="verse" rel="v028001010" id="001010" >10</span>
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="chapter" id="001001">1</span> And the number of the Israelites shall be as the sand of the sea, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Which cannot be measured or numbered; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And instead of its being said of them, <<Ye are not my people,>>  <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; They shall be called, <<The sons of the living God.>> 
<span class="verse" rel="v028001011" id="001011" >11</span>
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And the Judahites and the Israelites shall be gathered together, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And they shall appoint for themselves one head, and they shall go up out of the land, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; For great shall he the day of Jezreel. <span class="chapter" id="02 001">2 </span><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Say ye to your brother, <<My people>> and to your sister, <<Pitied>>. <span class="chapter" id="004001">4</span><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Hear the word of Jehovah, O Israelites, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; For Jehovah hath a charge against the inhabitants of the land, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; For there is no fidelity, nor true love, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor knowledge of God in the land, 
<span class="verse" rel="v028004002" id="004002" >2</span>
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; But perjury, lying, and murder, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Stealing, committing adultery, and deeds of violence, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And acts of bloodshed quickly follow each other. 
<span class="verse" rel="v028004003" id="004003" >3</span>
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore the land mourns, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And all its inhabitants languish, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Together with the wild beasts and the birds of the heavens, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; While even the fish of the sea are swept away, 
<span class="verse" rel="v028004003" id="004003" >3</span>
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet let none bring charges, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And let none reprove, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Since my people are but as their priestlings, 
<span class="verse" rel="v028004005" id="004005" >5</span>
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; O priest, thou shalt stumble by day, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And the prophet also shall stumble with thee, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; By night I will destroy thy people. 
<span class="verse" rel="v028004006" id="004006" >6</span>
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy people are being destroyed for lack of knowledge. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Because thou hast rejected knowledge, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; I reject thee from being priest to me. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Since thou hast forgotten the instruction of thy God, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; I also will forget thy children. 
<span class="verse" rel="v028004007" id="004007" >7</span>
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; The more they increased the more they sinned against me, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; They have changed their glory for shame. 
<span class="verse" rel="v028004008" id="004008" >8</span>
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; They feed on the sin of my people, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And they lust after their guilt. 
<span class="verse" rel="v028004009" id="004009" >9</span>
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus it comes to be, like people, like priest, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; But I will visit upon each punishment for his ways, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And their deeds I will requite to them. 
<span class="verse" rel="v028004010" id="004010" >10</span>
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; For they shall eat and not be satisfied, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; They shall play the harlot and not find satisfaction,  Because they have ceased to heed Jehovah. 
<span class="verse" rel="v028004011" id="004011" >11</span>
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Harlotry and sweet wine take away the understanding; 
<span class="verse" rel="v028004012" id="004012" >12</span>
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; My people ask counsel of their wood, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And their staff makes known to them their oracle! <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; For a spirit of harlotry has led them astray, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; So that they have played the harlot from after their God. 
<span class="verse" rel="v028004013" id="004013" >13</span>
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; On the heights of the mountains they sacrifice, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And on the hills they burn their offerings, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Under oaks and poplars and terebinths, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; For their shade is pleasant! <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore your daughters play the harlot, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And your brides commit adultery. 
<span class="verse" rel="v028004014" id="004014" >14</span>
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; I will not punish your daughters because they play the harlot,   <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor your brides because they commit adultery, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And sacrificed with consecrated prostitutes; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus the stupid people come to ruin! 
<span class="verse" rel="v028004015" id="004015" >15</span>
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Though thou play the harlot, Israel, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Let not Judah become guilty, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And do not come to Gilgal <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And do not go up to Beth-avem. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And do not swear at Beersheha, As Jehovah liveth. 
<span class="verse" rel="v028004016" id="004016" >16</span>
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Yea, like a stubborn heifer, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Israel has behaved stubbornly, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Can Jehovah now feed him, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; As he would a lamb in a broad pasture? 
<span class="verse" rel="v028004017" id="004017" >17</span>
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Ephraim is wedded to idols; leave him alone! 
<span class="verse" rel="v028004018" id="004018" >18</span>
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; A band of topers! They gave themselves up to harlotry; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; They love shame more than honor. 
<span class="verse" rel="v028004019" id="004019" >19</span>
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; A wind-storm shall envelop them in its wings, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And they shall be ashamed of their altars. <span class="chapter" id="005001">5</span><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Hear this, O priests, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And hearken, O house of Israel, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And, O house of the king, give heed; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Since for you is the judgment. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;  A snare have you become at Mizpeh, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And a net spread out on Tabor, 
<span class="verse" rel="v028005002" id="005002" >2</span>
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And a deep pit have they dug at Shittim, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And there is no correction for any of them? 
<span class="verse" rel="v028005003" id="005003" >3</span>
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; I indeed know Ephraim, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And Israel is not hid from me, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; For thou, O Ephraim, hast played the harlot, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Israel is defiled. 
<span class="verse" rel="v028005004" id="005004" >4</span>
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Their deeds do not permit them, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; To return to their God, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; For the spirit of harlotry is within them, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And Jehovah they do not know. 
<span class="verse" rel="v028005005" id="005005" >5</span>
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore Israel’s pride shall testify to his face, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And Ephraim shall stumble through his guilt. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Judah also shall stumble with them. 
<span class="verse" rel="v028005006" id="005006" >6</span>
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; With their sheep and their cattle, they shall go about <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; To seek Jehovah, but shall not find him, 
<span class="verse" rel="v028005007" id="005007" >7</span>
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; For they have been untrue to Jehovah, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Since they have begotten alien children; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; A new moon may destroy them with their portions. <br />
<span class="verse" rel="v028005008" id="005008" >8</span>
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Blow the trumpet in Gibeah, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; The clarion in Ramah, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Raise the alarm in Bethel, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Make Benjamin trernble, 
<span class="verse" rel="v028005009" id="005009" >9</span>
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Ephraim shall become a desolation <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; In the day of punishment, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Concerning the tribes of Israel I make known what is certain. 
<span class="verse" rel="v028005010" id="005010" >10</span>
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; The princes of Israel have become, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Like those who remove the landmarks; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon them I will pour out my wrath like water. 
<span class="verse" rel="v028005011" id="005011" >11</span>
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Ephraim practises oppression and crushes right, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; For he is determined to go after vanity. <br />
<span class="verse" rel="v028005012" id="005012" >12</span>

<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Judah for thee also a harvest is set.  When I would turn, when I would heal Israel,  Then Ephraini’s guilt is revealed,  And Samaria’s crimes are seen  How they practise fraud and the thief enters in,  While abroad bandits plunder.  2But they never think in their hearts,  That all their wickedness I remember.’  Now their deeds have encompassed them,  They are ever before my face.  2In their wickedness they anoint kings,’"  And in their falsehood princes,  ’Since they are all of them adulterers.v  2By clay"’ they make our king sick,  And the princes with fever from wine,  He stretches forth his hand with dissolute fellows,  ’For like an oven their heart burns with treachery,`  All night theirs’ anger slumbers,  In the morning it blazes into a flame of fire.  7A11 of them glow like an oven,  And they devour their rulers,  All their kings have fallen.

Evidences of the Nation’s Degeneracy and Approaching Dissolution,  Hos. 78-83  Hos. 7 ’Ephraim—he lets himself be mixed among the peoples, Ephraim—he has become a cake unturned.z  9Strangersa have devoured his strength, but he does not know it; Also gray hairsb are sprinkled upon him, but he knows it not, "And Israel’s pride° has testified to his face:  Yet they do not return to Jehovah their God,  And in all this they seek him not.  11Ephraim is like a simple, silly dove:  To Egypt they call, after Assyria they go,  ’As often as they go away, I will spread over them my net,  Like birds of the heavens I will bring them down;  I will chastise them because of their wickedness;d  "Woe to them, that they have strayed from me!  Destruction to them, because they have been untrue to me.  Although it was I who redeemed them, they spoke lies about me, ’And they have never cried to one with their heart,  But they are ever howling beside their altars for corn and new wine,  They cut cut themselves,e they rebel against me,  ’Although it was I who trained and strengthened their arms, Concerning me they plan only evil, "they turn to Baal,g  They have become like a bow that swerves,h   Their princes shall fall by the sword,   Because of the insolence of their tongues.i   In the land of Egypt, S ’they will lick the dust)   For as an eagle I will swoop down upon my house,k  Because they have transgressed my covenant,  And trespassed against my law.,  ’To me they continually cry,  ’My God, we Israel, know thee’  ’Israel has spurned that which is good,  Let the foe pursue him.  § 22.

To Egypt must they return,=  "For Israel forgot his Maker,  And Judah built palaces,  Judah also multiplied fenced cities;  And so I will send fire upon her cities,  And it shall devour her palaces..  § 23.

Israel’s Corrupt Religious Practices and the Inevitable Judgment,  Hos. 910-109  Hos. 9 "Like grapes in the wilderness I found Israel;`)  Like the first fruit on a fig-tree" I saw your fathers;  But as soon as they came to Baal-peor,q they consecrated themselves  to Baal,r  And became as abominable as the object of their love.

"Give them, 0 Jehovah—what wilt thou give ?  Give them’ a miscarrying womb and dry breasts!’  ’All their evil culminated in Gilgal,w yea, there I learned to hate them.  Because of the evil of their deeds I will drive them out of my house.  I will no longer love them, for all their nobles arc rebels.

Against the dastardsP 10! will come, and chastize them,q  And peoples shall be gathered against them,  To chastize them for their double eriines.r  11Ephraim indeed was a traineds heifer that loved to thresh, And I myself laid a yoke’ upon his fair neck, I made Ephraim draw; he must plow;  Jacobi’ must harrow for himself.  ’Sow for yourselves righteousness,  Reap the fruits of love;  Break up your fallow ground;  For it is time to seek Jehovah,  To the end that the fruit of righteousness’ may come to you.w  "But ye have plowed wickedness, iniquity have ye reaped;  Ye have eaten the fruit of lies.  Because thou hast trusted in chariots,x in the multitude of thy warriors,  "Therefore the alarm of war shall sound in thy cities  And all thy fortresses shall be ruined,  As Shahnanz laid in ruins Beth-arbel in the day of battle, The mother being dashed to pieces over her children. 15Thus will P do to you, 0 house of Israel,b  Because of the enormity of your wickedness,  In the dawne shall the king of Israel be utterly cut off.  § 26.

Jehovah’s Final and Complete Destruction of the Guilty Nation,  Hos. 13  Hos. 13 ’When Ephraim used to speak there was trembling;u  A prince was he in Israel.

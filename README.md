Open English Bible
==================


About
-----

The Open English Bible is the anticipated end product of a project intended to create an English translation of the Bible that is:

* under a licence enabling the maximum reuse, remixing and sharing without requiring the payment of royalties or the obtaining of permission from copyright holders; and
* a translation reflecting modern English usage and Biblical scholarship

The OEB is being formed by editing the public domain Twentieth Century New Testament, which was a new translation of the New Testament published in the early twentieth century, based on the Greek text of Westcott and Hort.

As such, the OEB as a translation does not stand within the Tyndale tradition but has a separate tradition in a similar manner to the NIV and New English Bible.

\ms Jehovah's Love for Jacob

\q \v 2 I have loved you, saith Jehovah.
\q Yet ye say, Wherein bast thou loved us?
\q Was not Esau Jacob's brother?
\q It is the oracle of Jehovah of hosts; 
\q Yet I loved Jacob; \v 3 but Esau I hated,
\q And I made his mountains a desolation,
\q And transformed his heritage into a wilderness.
\q \v 4 Whereas Edom saith, We are cast down,
\q But we will return and build the waste places;
\q Thus saith Jehovah of hosts,
\q They shall build, but I will throw down;
\q Men shall call them, The border land of wickedness,
\q The people against whom Jehovah hath indignation.
\q \v 5 And your eyes shall see,
\q And ye shall say, Jehovah is magnified 
\q Beyond the border of Israel.

\ms Infidelity and Ingratitude of the Priests

\q \v 6  A son honoreth his father; and a servant feareth his master;
\q If then I am a father, where is mine honor?
\q And if I am a master, where is the one who fears me?
\q Saith Jehovah to you, O ye priests, who despise my name.
\q But ye say, 'Wherein have we despised thy name?'
\q \v 7 Ye offer upon mine altar bread that is polluted
\q And ye say, 'Wherein have we polluted it?'
\q In that ye say, 'The table of Jehovah is contemptible.'
\q \v8 And that when ye offer the blind for sacrifice, 'It is no harm!'
\q And that when ye offer the lame and the sick 'It is no harm!'
\q Present it now to thy governor; will he be pleased with it?
\q Or will he receive thee favorably? saith Jehovah of hosts.
\q \v 9 And now entreat the favor of God with such an offering, that he may be gracious to us,
\q Would I receive any of you favorably? saith Jehovah of hosts.
\b
\q \v 10 O that there were those among you who would shut the doors,
\q That ye might not kindle fire on mine altar in vain!
\q I have no pleasure in you, saith Jehovah of hosts,
\q Neither will I accept an offering at your hand.
\q \v 11 For from the rising of the sun even to its setting my name is sacred among the nations;
\q And in every place they offer to my name a pure offering;
\q For my name is great among the nations, saith Jehovah of hosts.
\b
\q \v 12 But ye profane it, in that ye say,
\q 'The table of Jehovah is polluted, and its food is contemptible.'
\q \v 13 Ye say also, 'Behold what a weariness is it!' and ye have scorned me;
\q And ye have brought the blind, the lame and the sick.
\q Should I accept this at your hand? saith Jehovah of hosts.
\q \v 14 But cursed be the deceiver, who has in his flock a male,
\q And vows, and sacrifices to the Lord a blemished thing;
\q For I am a great King, and my name is feared among the nations.
\b
\c 2 
\q \v 1 And now, O ye priests, this command is for you.
\q \v 2 If ye will not hear, and if ye will not lay it to heart,
\q To give glory to my name, saith Jehovah of hosts,
\q Then I will send the curse upon you, and I will curse your blessings;
\q \v 3 Behold, I will cut off your arm,
\q And will spread offal upon your faces, even the offal of your feasts,
\q \v 4 And ye shall know that I have sent this command to you,
\q That my covenant with Levi may be preserved, saith Jehovah of hosts.
\b
\q \v 5 My covenant with him was to give life and peace; 
\q And I gave them to him that he might revere me;
\q And he revered me, and stood in awe of my name. 
\q \v 6 The true instruction was in his mouth, 
\q And unrighteousness was not found in his lips; 
\q He walked with me in peace and uprightness, 
\q And turned many away from iniquity. 
\q \v 7 For the priest's lips should keep knowledge, 
\q And men should seek the law at his mouth; 
\q For he is the messenger of Jehovah of hosts.
\b
\q \v 8 But ye are turned aside out of the way;
\q Ye have caused many to stumble in the law;
\q Ye have corrupted the covenant of Levi,
\q Saith Jehovah of hosts.
\q \v 9 Therefore have I also made you contemptible,
\q And base before all the people,
\q According as ye have not kept my ways,
\q And have had no respect for me in imparting the law.

\ms Condemnation of Divorce

\q \v 10 Have we not all one father?
\q Hath not one God created us?
\q Why do we deal faithlessly with one another. 
\q Profaning the covenant of our fathers?
\q \v 13 And this ye do also:
\q Ye cover the altar of Jehovah with tears,
\q So that he regardeth not the offering any more. 
\q Neither receiveth it acceptably from your hand.
\q \v 14 Yet ye say. Why?
\q Because Jehovah hath been witness between thee and the wife of
thy youth,
\q Against whom thou hast dealt faithlessly,
\q Though she is thy companion, and the wife of thy covenant.
\b
\q \v 15 Therefore give heed to your spirit.
\q And let none deal faithlessly with the wife of his youth,
\q \v 16 For I hate putting away,
\q Saith Jehovah, the God of Israel,
\q And him who covers his garment with violence,^
\q Saith Jehovah of hosts:
\q Therefore take heed to your spirit, that ye deal not faithlessly.

\ms Jehovah's Coming Judgment

\q \v 17 Ye have wearied Jehovah with your words. 
\q Yet ye say, How have we wearied him?
\q In that ye say, Everyone that doeth evil
\q Is good in the sight of Jehovah,
\q And he delighteth in them;
\q Or where is the God of justice?
\b
\c 3 
\q \v 1 Behold, I am about to send my messenger,
\q And he shall prepare the way before me:
\q And the Lord, whom ye seek,
\q Will suddenly come to his temple;
\q \v 2 But who can endure the day of his coming?
\q And who shall stand when he appeareth?
\q For he is like a refiner's fire,
\q And like fullers' lyes;
\q \v 3 And he will sit as a refiner and purifier,
\q And he will purify the sons of Levi,
\q And refine them as gold and silver;
\q And they shall offer offerings in righteousness.
\q \v 4 Then shall the offerings of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasant to Jehovah,
\q As in the days of old, and as in former years.
\b
\q \v 5 And I will come near to you to judgment;
\q And I will he a swift witness
\q Against the sorcerers, and against the adulterers,
\q And against thee who sware to that which is false,
\q And against those who oppress the hireling, the widow, and the
fatherless,
\q Who turn aside the resident alien from his right, and fear not me,
\q Saith Jehovah of hosts.
\q \v 6 For I, Jehovah, change not;
\q But ye have not ceased to be sons of Jacob.

\ms Penalty for Withholding the Tithe

\q \v 7 From the days of thy fathers ye have turned aside from my statutes, and ye have not kept them.
\q Turn to me and I will turn to you, saith Jehovah.
\q But ye say, Wherein shall we turn?
\q \v 8 Will a man rob God? Yet ye robbed me.
\q But ye say, wherein have we robbed thee? In tithes and gifts.
\q \v 9 Ye are cursed with a curse, for ye rob me.
\b
\q \v 10 Bring ye the whole tithe into the store-house,
\q That there may be provision in mine house; and test me thereby,
\q If I will not open to you the windows of heaven,
\q And pour you out a blessing, until there is more than enough.
\q \v 11 I will rebuke for your sakes the devourer and he shall not destroy the fruit of the ground,
\q Neither shall the vine fail to ripen its fruit in the field,
\q \v 12 And all nations shall call you happy,
\q For ye shall be a delightsome land, saith Jehovah of hosts.

\ms Future Reward of the Godless and Faithful

\q \v 13 Your words are hard upon me, saith Jehovah.
\q Ye say, What have we said against thee?
\q \v 14 Ye have said, it is useless to serve God,
\q And what gain is it to us to have kept his charge,
\q And that we have walked in funeral garb before him?t
\q \v 15 Even now we call the proud happy,
\q Yea, those who work iniquity thrive,
\q Yea, they tempt God and escape.
\q \v 16 Such things those who feared Jehovah spoke to one another,
\q And Jehovah gave heed, and heard,
\q And a book of remembrance was written before him,
\q Regarding those who feared Jehovah,
\q And those who keep in mind his name;
\q \v 17 And they shall be mine, saith Jehovah of hosts,
\q In the day that I make up mine especial treasure:
\q And I will spare them,
\q As a man spares his son who serves him.
\q \v 18 Then shall ye return and discern between the righteous and the wicked,
\q Between him who serves God and him who serves him not.
\b
\c 4 
\q \v 1 For behold the day is coming that shall burn like a furnace,
\q And all the proud and those who work iniquity shall be stubble,
\q And the day that is coming shall burn them up, saith Jehovah of hosts,
\q So that there shall be left them neither root nor branch.
\q \v 2 But to you who fear my name there shall arise
\q The sun of righteousness with healing in his wings,
\q And ye shall go forth and leap like calves out of the stall.
\q \v 3 And ye shall tread down the wicked,
\q For they shall be as ashes under the soles of your feet,
\q In the day in which I begin to execute, saith Jehovah of hosts. 
\b
\q \v 4 Remember the law of Moses my servant which I commanded him In Horeb for all Israel, statutes and judgments.
\q \v 5 Behold I am about to send to you Elijah the prophet,
\q Before the coming of the day of Jehovah, the great and terrible,
\q \v 6 And he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the sons and the heart of the sons to the fathers,
\q Lest I come and smite the earth with a curse,

Hyphenation
===========

Hyphentation is conformed to comply with standard modern hyphenation rules as suggested by:

* the Oxford English Dictionary
* the usage in the Revised English Bible
* the Economist Style Guide (at http://www.economist.com/research/styleGuide/index.cfm?page=738537)

Numbers such as twenty-three are hyphenated.

These choices are likely to require revisiting in adjusting the text for common American usage.

This is not a comment on the suitability of these words and phrases but is only a grammatical exercise.
